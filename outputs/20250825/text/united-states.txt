1) Putin persists, Trump dithers – and a just peace for Ukraine still seems a long way off | Olga Chyzh — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     The past few weeks have seen a flurry of activity billed as progress in the Russia-Ukraine peace process. Yet for Ukrainians, the reality remains unchanged: airstrikes still thunder across their cities, homes still burn, lives are still lost. Against this grim backdrop, the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, has seemed more than content to bask in the literal red-carpet treatment afforded by the president of the United States. Donald Trump, who has anointed himself mediator of this war, has nearly exhausted the lexicon of contradiction. Some days he proclaims that he alone can end this war. Then he insists that peace talks should be left to the two parties. At times he boasts that Putin “respects” him; at others, he castigates Putin for “going absolutely crazy”. This month, Trump vacillated between putting US troops on the table and ruling it out. Now he is reportedly considering using US private military firms for the job. For those watching – whether in Kyiv, Moscow, Washington or beyond – the effect is dizzying. Policy by improvisation is not strategy. And in a war where lives hang on the credibility of US commitments, unpredictability is not strength. It is abdication. So what is Trump doing, Nobel peace prize ambitions aside? Has he finally realised that Putin has no interest in a treaty that falls short of his maximalist goals? Or is this simply another chapter in a familiar playbook – headline chasing, image first, strategy later – where the costs will be borne not in Washington but on the streets of Kyiv? After a long learning curve, Trump may finally be realising that Putin has played him – that the two are not the close friends he once imagined. His repeated threats to impose new sanctions and tariffs on Russia are one example. Yet Trump has also shown time and again his willingness to forgive and forget, so long as Putin offers a new promise that this time things will be different. In the meantime, Ukraine appears to have found a workaround for direct US military aid, though one that comes at immense cost. With European financing, Kyiv can keep buying US weapons while Ukraine and the EU scale up production. It is hardly optimal, but it sustains the status quo: Ukraine survives, Trump claims credit for US arms profits, and Europe keeps Russia bogged down elsewhere. As long as this arrangement holds, the war will go on. Russia will continue to attack, but it will not defeat Ukraine. And in the absence of genuine US leadership, the conflict will persist as long as Putin can throw bodies forward. At the same time as Ukraine scrambles for survival, Putin is playing a different game altogether. He is the unlikely winner in this mayhem. Unable to seize an upper hand at the negotiating table through battlefield victories, he has fallen back on the tools that have served him for decades: obfuscation, manipulation and the grinding down of adversaries. Putin may not yet have secured everything on his wishlist, but he is nothing if not patient. Unlike democratic leaders, Putin faces no checks – only an inner circle of military and conservative elites with an imperialist worldview. To them, Ukraine is not just another territory to be bartered away to help boost Trump’s ego. It is the key to restoring Russia’s lost greatness. Putin also understands that US audiences crave clarity; they tire quickly of drawn-out talks and muddled messages. Fatigue becomes Putin’s ally. The tedium, the phone calls, the visits that go nowhere – these are not failures of diplomacy. They are the strategy. Once the war fades from headlines, his hope is to strike a bargain in the shadows: sanctions lifted, aid to Ukraine frozen. For Putin, every hour of confusion is an investment. The question is whether anyone else at the table has the stamina to see through it. The real loser in this, other than Ukraine, is Trump himself. For all his posturing, he risks selling himself short if his ambitions stop at a medal in Oslo. He imagines more – and he might even achieve it. If he emerges with a clear policy to end the war, this could be his Reagan moment: a chance to be celebrated as the saviour of the free world. Trump is not wrong that Joe Biden was too cautious to claim such a mantle. Trump, in contrast, could. Whether or not Putin personally respects him is debatable, but Putin does respect US military power. And there are options available, many well short of all-out war: the bipartisan Graham-Blumenthal bill, expanded air support, lifting missile restrictions and major increases in direct military aid, among others. Like any autocrat, Putin can be coerced. Biden was too timid to test that premise. Trump may not be. After all, unpredictability is his calling card. Should Trump force Putin to back down and end the war, he would secure a legacy as the unexpected hero. But if he allows Putin to dictate the outcome, the laurels will fall to Moscow. History will record not a peacemaker but a president who helped Russia, the US’s longtime adversary, reclaim its imperial standing while cementing the decline of US hegemony.

2) UK still intends to recognise a Palestinian state, David Lammy to tell MPs — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

     David Lammy will tell MPs on Monday that the UK still intends to recognise a Palestinian state in September, with Israel having shown no sign of meeting the government’s demands. The foreign secretary will say in a Commons statement that government officials intend to carry out a formal assessment in the coming days of whether Israel has complied with the tests set out by the prime minister, Keir Starmer. But with Benjamin Netanyahu’s government continuing to harden its position on Gaza and the West Bank, the foreign secretary will confirm that Britain still plans to recognise Palestine. A UK official said: “We will assess all the factors relevant to recognition, but as things stand we’re on a pathway to recognition later in September.” Starmer said earlier in August that the UK would recognise Palestine before the UN general assembly, which starts on 9 September, unless Israel met a series of preconditions. The prime minister made his statement after conversations with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The latter has said France intends to recognise Palestine at the UN meeting. Starmer also spoke to Donald Trump before announcing his decision. The US president indicated the US would not object to such a move, but British officials are worried that his administration might retaliate by recognising Israeli jurisdiction over illegal settlements in the West Bank. Starmer’s conditions for Israel include taking “substantive steps” to end the war in Gaza, agreeing a ceasefire and committing not to annex parts of the West Bank. Far from taking steps towards satisfying any of those demands, however, Netanyahu has shown signs of violating them further. Reuters reported that Israel was considering annexation in the West Bank if France, the UK and other countries push ahead with recognising Palestine. Israeli officials said the subject was on the agenda for Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting on Sunday, but would not say where or when annexation could happen. The Foreign Office has just over a week to complete its formal assessment of Israel’s position. Senior government officials say the timing of the British recognition is being driven less by that process and more by diplomatic concerns that the government should be seen to be acting in concert with France. Lammy said on Sunday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where UN-backed experts recently declared a famine, was a “man-made catastrophe” caused by Israel’s refusal to let in aid deliveries. The UN panel said more than half a million people were living in famine conditions, which were likely to spread further in coming weeks. Lammy said in a statement: “The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic, with famine in Gaza City and women and girls bearing the brunt of the suffering. “The UK is doing all we can to improve the situation but we remain crystal clear: for aid to have impact, Israel must ensure it is allowed in and delivered safely and securely to civilians in desperate need.” The government also announced an extra £3m on Sunday to provide midwives and emergency medical supplies for new mothers in Gaza, but it said the aid would only reach the people who needed it if Israel allowed much greater humanitarian access to the region. Lammy said: “This funding can only have maximum impact if the government of Israel allows it. “Israel must ensure protection of civilians including healthcare staff and health infrastructure, and enable the delivery of life-saving medicines, medical equipment and healthcare supplies into Gaza.”

3) Is flying the St George’s cross a sign of racism or patriotism? | Letters — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     Last week in my small rural town, St George’s flags were erected from lamp-posts and crudely daubed on roundabouts and zebra crossings, while residents were subjected to “Sieg Heil” as a mob walked along the streets. Downing Street has put out a statement that patriotism is important, while Joanne Monk, the Reform UK leader of Worcestershire city council, also emphasised pride in the flag. I have nothing against the flag per se, but when Nazi thugs use it to demonstrate and catcall, it morphs into something else entirely. As a Black person, I have been subject to abuse three times in the past fortnight. My 12-year-old child and his friend were called “paedos” at school – they are the only Black children in the class – and a friend’s child was called the N-word on the bus (this was before the summer recess). To be Black in the countryside at the moment is to have a target on your back. There are real-world consequences of constantly demonising Black and Brown people in the media, racialising crimes and acting as if the most vulnerable people in our society – asylum seekers – are the reasons your energy bills are too high or you can’t afford your food shop. Nigel Farage and his acolytes know what they are doing with their disinformation and division campaign, and the media should be ashamed of giving them so much airtime. As Rafael Behr notes (There’s an obvious way to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do it, 27 August), the distraction technique is a well-worn part of Farage’s playbook. A strong prime minister would call him out, not mimic him. If he gets into Downing Street in 2029, as some pollsters predict, we will only have ourselves to blame. Name and address supplied • I am surprised that someone who asked their neighbour to take down an England flag is astonished by their refusal to do so (Letters, 26 August). But why would they comply? The flag is not obscene, offensive or inappropriate; it is the flag of England being flown in England. I do not recall similar objections when Ukrainian flags appeared in windows in a display of solidarity. Nor do such debates arise when the England men’s football team enjoys success, prompting a surge of flags in cars, pubs and homes. And the union jacks along the Mall in London rarely attract controversy. To equate the St George’s cross with extremism is a mistake. Suppressing its display does not challenge intolerance, it merely silences legitimate expressions of national identity. Surely the more constructive approach is to foster open discussion rather than to remove symbols. If one chooses to live in England, one should reasonably expect to see England’s flag flown with pride. There is nothing inherently wrong in expressing affection for one’s own country. Name and address supplied • I live on a terrace of 16 houses. A couple of years ago, one of our neighbours put up a St George’s cross. At first, the flag seemed football-related, but they left it flying indefinitely. As such a powerful signifier of patriotism, many of us felt it gave our terrace a distorted and unwanted image. It then occurred to us that we could drown out that cultural noise by us all flying flags. Ten houses participated. We made poles from fishing rods and bamboo. I chose the flag of Jamaica to represent my partly Caribbean family. There were flags from the Philippines, Scotland, Spain, rainbows and doves, and we raised them as high as possible above the union flag. On breezy, sunny days they made our terrace seem like a festival of difference. Many people asked residents what we were celebrating. Our answer was that “we are from everywhere”. The St George’s cross couple soon left and our community settled back into its peaceful ways. Jane Ryan Woodbridge, Suffolk • Further to the very interesting letters about the current rash of flags, has anyone noticed that nearly all the ones on tall lamp-posts are flying at half mast? Is it just that flag-flyers don’t have cherry pickers, or are we unconsciously in mourning for the decline of compassion and decency? Michael Pyke Lichfield, Staffordshire • It’s heartening to see so many lads supporting the England women’s team in the Rugby World Cup with their street flags.

4) The Cracker Barrel mess exposes the cynicism of the rightwing culture war | Sidney Blumenthal — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     First they came for the Smithsonian. Then they came for Cracker Barrel. Whether it’s the museums or the corporations – or the universities, law firms, federal departments and agencies – the attack lines of the Trump culture war and its culture warriors are the same. The vicious full-scale assault on the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain after the company naively wandered on to the battle zone by altering its “Old Timer” logo exposes the cynicism of the whole operation and its ulterior motive to impose an authoritarian regime over every aspect of American society. On 19 August, Donald Trump launched his purge campaign against the Smithsonian with a post denouncing it as “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE’ …where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.” Within 24 hours, the son echoed the father, but with a different target in the crosshairs. The day after Trump denounced the Smithsonian, Donald Trump Jr took umbrage at Cracker Barrel, joining a rightwing social media mob. Cracker Barrel’s sales had gone flat partly due to its creaky image, symbolized by a logo featuring a geezer in overalls seated cross-legged and leaning on a barrel, promoted as the “Uncle Herschel” of the store’s founder. At the company headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee, the “Uncle Herschel Memorial” features statues of “Uncle Herschel” seated on a bench listening to a Cracker Barrel waitress. Marketing research, however, showed that the rickety ambience was off-putting to a younger suburban clientele. So “Uncle Herschel” was retired, the logo cleaned up with just the brand name front and center, the interiors with dark brown log cabin walls whitewashed and more brightly lit. But this marketing facelift, a common corporate design “refinement”, as it is known, was a new frontier beyond “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE’”. Don Jr retweeted a post by an account called the Woke War Room attacking Julie Felss Masino, the Cracker Barrel CEO: “She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding. She should resign and be replaced with leadership that will restore Cracker Barrel’s tradition.” If Don Jr had ever eaten at a Cracker Barrel, he would have had to leave the confines of Manhattan and Palm Beach. There is not a single Cracker Barrel to be found in any borough of New York City, or on Long Island either. His personal experience with “tradition” is not located in the biscuit mix section of the country store. If Don Jr’s complaint is with “soulless branding”, it does not extend to the sale of the $DJTJR (Donald J Trump Jr) crypto memecoin. But this bit of brazen hypocrisy is lost in the ocean of the Trump family’s grifting. When the right launched its version of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, now with the power of the Trump administration behind it, nobody predicted that Cracker Barrel would become collateral damage. The Tennessee-based chain, founded in 1969, trafficked in faux rustic pre-second world war nostalgia, an image from before the existence of supermarkets, shopping malls and the interstate highways where most of the restaurants are located. Cracker Barrel was a little theme park. Customers entered through a retail outlet that resembled a country store. On the restaurant’s walls hung old advertising signs, farm implements and framed antique photos of 19th-century folk with a grim American Gothic look. The menu consisted of “homestyle food”, including “the best classic meatloaf” with mashed potatoes and gravy. But in the 1990s and early 2000s the business suffered protests after the firing of employees suspected of being gay and reached an agreement with the justice department to change its management practices after allegedly segregating Black diners. The clientele that favored the kitsch decor also dwindled. In response, the company shed its old prejudiced practices and recently unveiled its makeover to update its tired image. That provided the pretext for the calculated Maga explosion. Hillsdale College, a rightwing citadel in southern Michigan that has been vehement in ramping up the culture wars, posted on X the plain Cracker Barrel logo on one side of a frame with a statue of George Washington splattered with red paint on the other under the line: “Same energy.” The Hillsdale account added: “Cracker Barrel is a beloved cultural icon, tied to the lifestyle and memories of truth-seeking Americans.” According to this college, a center of conservative thought, the restaurant chain is apparently the cultural equivalent of the Smithsonian, or should be exhibited there, and its customers who have pulled in for the chicken fried steak are “truth-seeking Americans”, presumably as opposed to those who stop for the chicken wings at Chili’s. The culture war doesn’t stop at the logo’s edge. The Woke War Room that aroused Don Jr used the attack line that Cracker Barrel perpetrates a “DEI regime”. The CEO’s picture was placed next to the rainbow logo of the LGBTQ+ Alliance. The post also noted that America First Legal, a far-right group founded by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy involved in Ice raids, the culture war against universities and apparently much else, had filed complaints with the Equal Opportunities Employment Commission and the Tennessee attorney general alleging racial discrimination by Cracker Barrel because of its DEI policy. The Maga mob piled in with misogynistic tweets against the female CEO. A Maga social media influencer, Robby Starbuck, advancing himself within the rightwing constellation as an anti-DEI activist, threatened: “Oh my goodness. When you see what we’ve got on Cracker Barrel … Wow. I don’t think anyone knew it was as bad as the stuff we received. We’re talking total capture by leftism at the exec level. We have photos, videos, etc. Should I put it all in 1 video or release 1 by 1?” In 2022, Starbuck, whose given name is Robert Newsom, was excluded from running in the Republican primary for the Tennessee fifth congressional district by the Tennessee Republican party, which found that he was not “a bona fide Republican”. His exclusion was upheld by the Tennessee supreme court. On 23 August, Fox News featured his video denouncing Cracker Barrel for its involvement in gay pride events – “a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of leftwing activists” with a “soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future”. This month, he began advising Meta “on efforts to curb what they describe as political bias in its AI tools”, according to the Wall Street Journal. His advisory role comes amid a defamation settlement after a Meta AI chatbot inaccurately said he had been involved in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. He has only been part of social media mobs. Stoking the ferocity of the onslaught against Cracker Barrel, Starbuck spoke with Christopher Rufo, who has positioned himself among the chief culture war activists on the right. He had been the key adviser to the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, in his crusades to ban books, attack the Walt Disney Company as “woke” and assail universities. Rufo is a certain kind of zealot who has achieved his greatest influence under Trump, like Miller and Project 2025’s Russell Vought, now the head of the office of management and budget, self-styled ideological commissars with a Bolshevik mentality. In a speech in 2022 at Hillsdale College, which Rufo titled Laying Siege to the Institutions, he boasted of his “very aggressive” campaign against Disney. “You have to be ruthless and brutal in pursuit of something good,” he said, in a Leninist spirit, describing a “narrative war” with American corporations and institutions. “We get in there, we defund things we don’t like, we fund things we do like.” The following year, Rufo spent six weeks in Hungary as a fellow at the Danube Institute, a thinktank closely aligned with the country’s authoritarian leader, Viktor Orbán. “My deepest interest,” Rufo wrote, “was to understand how Hungary … is attempting to rebuild its culture and institutions, from schools to universities to media … Hungary’s leaders are serious people combatting the same forces confronted by conservatives in the West.” One lesson Rufo drew from Orbán’s “culture-war strategy” was that there would be, “for the foreseeable future, a large state that has power over family, education, and culture, and conservative political leaders are abdicating their responsibility if they do not employ it to advance conservative aims”. When Trump won the 2024 election, Rufo contributed his battle plan alongside the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. “In the transition period, I laid out a counterrevolution blueprint that outlined my strategy for how the president and the administration could take decisive action in the war against these left-wing ideologies.” He crowed about the accusation of reverse discrimination against virtually every institution public and private – ”anti-white bigotry should face just as severe a sanction as anti-Black bigotry” – and said he sought “to figure out how to adjust the formula of finances from the federal government to the universities in a way that puts them in an existential terror and have them say, Unless we change what we’re doing, we’re not going to be able to meet our budget for the year.” But until Rufo talked to Starbuck about the villainy of Cracker Barrel, he said, he had not paid attention. “At first, I dismissed the story as trivial. I have never set foot in a Cracker Barrel and, as such, have little stake in what is emblazoned above its doorways,” Rufo wrote in City Journal, the magazine of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative thinktank where he is a senior fellow. “The logo change might have caught the public’s initial attention, but the underlying political story had real stakes. If companies that depend on conservatives adopt radical left-wing policies, they must face the consequences.” Rufo decided that Cracker Barrel was a worthy target for the overarching culture war. “Some might dismiss the Cracker Barrel campaign as minor, or even embarrassing … But there is enormous value in making an example of the company and cementing a fear that conservatives can spontaneously lash out at any institution that crosses the line. Today, it’s Cracker Barrel; tomorrow it might be Pepsi, Target, or Procter &amp; Gamble.” Cracker Barrel’s “Old Timer” logo had to be manufactured into a cause célèbre for a larger purpose. “Even if we don’t care about Cracker Barrel in particular,” Rufo wrote, “we should all care about the ideological capture of American institutions and use whatever power we have to reverse it. And for that to occur, the Barrel must be broken.” With that call to arms, Rufo gives the game away. He doesn’t really take the conspiratorial fiction seriously. It is useful only as an instrument for bludgeoning those designated as objective enemies in order to build toward absolute power. In the gradation of his hierarchy of conservative principles, the highest value is cynicism. Rufo’s rhetoric has the characteristic tone of Stalin’s statement on 29 July 1936 declaring his Great Purge: “The inalienable quality of every Bolshevik under present conditions should be the ability to recognize an enemy of the Party no matter how well he may be masked.” On 26 August, Trump entered the fray, saying that Cracker Barrel should “admit a mistake … Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again. Remember, in just a short period of time I made the United States of America the ‘HOTTEST’ Country anywhere in the World. One year ago, it was ‘DEAD.’ Good luck!” That evening, Cracker Barrel executives reportedly called the Trump White House to offer unconditional surrender. “They thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic ‘original’ logo,” Taylor Budowich, the cabinet secretary, posted. “They wanted the President to know that they heard him … and would be restoring the ‘Old Timer.’ So smart! Congrats Cracker Barrel and America!” The White House issued an official statement announcing the restoration as if it were a decisive presidential action: “Congratulations Cracker Barrel!” Nobel prize! “Uncle Herschel” was back, the “woke” conspiracy again defeated, another victory in the culture war.

5) Putin, Modi and Erdoğan among leaders in China for talks with Xi — The Guardian (2025-08-31)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/31/putin-modi-erdogan-xi-china-talks
   Text:
     Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have met on the sidelines of a showpiece summit in China that seeks to challenge US-led, western-dominated blocs and is being attended by the leaders of more than two dozen nations. The Chinese and Russian leaders, who are closely allied under what they have termed a “limitless” partnership, discussed Putin’s recent meeting with Donald Trump, according to a Kremlin official, who gave no further details. The bilateral meeting was one of several for Xi on Sunday, who is hosting the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. The SCO is a 10-member bloc of Eurasian nations, and the summit is also being attended by the leaders of 16 observer or “dialogue partner” nations. Xi personally welcomed several leaders including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, before the delegates attended a formal reception. Xi told the welcome reception that in the past century there had been a “significant increase in instability, uncertainty and unpredictable factors”, and that the SCO had become an “important force in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind”. Footage published by Russian state media showed Xi and Putin, who arrived in Tianjin with an entourage of senior politicians and business representatives, warmly greeting each other at a photocall before calling in an interpreter for a lengthy and animated conversation. Putin and several other attenders are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China refers to as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is also expected to attend. The Tianjin summit is the largest held by the bloc since it was formed in 2001. The SCO is a key part of Beijing’s push for stronger multilateral alternatives to western or US-led blocs such as Nato. Putin told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Saturday that the SCO meeting would “consolidate solidarity” among the Eurasian nations and “help shape a fairer multipolar world order”. The goal appears to have been helped by the upheaval brought by Trump’s tariff regime and other foreign policy moves. Modi and Xi’s meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. It is Modi’s first visit to China in seven years, and comes amid efforts by China and India to rebuild trade ties and resolve long-running Himalayan border disputes. “We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,” Modi said after meeting Xi. Xi said China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported. In a meeting with Erdoğan, Xi said China and Turkey should strengthen cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism, according to Chinese state media. Xi also met leaders of the Maldives, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, a key ally of Putin. The bilateral talks were held at the Tianjin Guest House, an intimate venue surrounded by lush greenery. Large sections of Tianjin were closed to traffic and a significant police presence was deployed around the city. Lim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, said Putin and Xi meeting again was a sign of the continuation of their “limitless” partnership, and closing ranks while both deal with a common foe – the US. “As long as the mutual opponent [US] has not been defeated, China and Russia’s off-limits cooperation will remain,” Lim said. “Their cooperation also serves to highlight a global order that exists beyond the United States.” Moscow’s claims over Ukraine and its full invasion in 2022, as well as Beijing’s claim over Taiwan and threats to invade, have further isolated both governments from western and other democracies. Russian analysts have said the Ukraine war is now a main pillar of the bilateral relationship and that Moscow would want know how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting. “The longer the war [on Ukraine] drags on, the more Russia will need China’s assistance, whether economically or other forms,” Lim said. “China also recognises that it is unlikely for Sino-US relations to return to their pre-2018 state and thus has no choice but to accept a close alignment with Russia.” Beijing purports to take a neutral stance on the Ukraine war but has become an economic lifeline for Russia, and Ukraine has accused it of providing direct aid to Moscow’s campaign. The two countries have separately increased joint military drills. A Chinese academic who spoke on condition of anonymity said Moscow had expected more support from its ally but Beijing had been at pains to avoid further punitive sanctions. “China says there is ‘no limit’ but in practice it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato. It has never really taken Russia seriously – and Russia saw through this long ago,” the academic said. Additional research by Lillian Yang

6) Illicit and 3D-printed firearms are a growing problem. Authorities are struggling to keep up — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     In 2023 a Canberra mechanic was servicing a grey BMW when he made a startling discovery. Under the seat he found a handgun. The pistol looked strange. It was made almost entirely of plastic – half white, half black. The mechanic didn’t know it but the car belonged to a street-level drug trafficker who’d come down from Sydney seeking “fast money” slinging meth across Canberra’s suburbs. The gun had been made by an associate with a 3D printer, according to court documents. It was untraceable and lethal, and part of a trend that experts say threatens to fundamentally upend Australia’s world-leading gun controls. Andrew Hemming, an expert in criminal law at the University of Southern Queensland, says the laws on 3D-printed firearms are a “dog’s breakfast”. Manufacturing or possessing any type of firearm without a licence is illegal across Australia but specific laws on 3D printing vary between the states. Some have criminalised the manufacture of 3D-printed weapons or owning blueprints while others rely on existing firearm laws. Hemming says the united action Australia took to tighten gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people were murdered, is now coming undone. “We all got together after Port Arthur and everybody pulled together with the ban [on some semi-automatic and pump-action firearms] and the buyback,” he says. “Well, the reality is … if anybody can make one, the sands have shifted and it’s only a question of time.” More sophisticated and more lethal The firearm found in Canberra resembled images of a popular 3D-printed pistol model known as the Harlot, court documents say. According to numerous online communities that celebrate and promote 3D-printed guns, the Harlot is entry-level. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It’s quick, and cheap to print, easy to assemble, and the hardware required to complete the build is readily available,” one website hosting instructional material says. But more reliable and more deadly models are now showing up. Det Supt John Watson, commander of the drug and firearms squad in New South Wales police state crime command and the head of the national illicit firearm working group, says police have been uncovering 3D-printed weapons for more than a decade. Over the past three to four years the trend has been from “very novice, very low-powered, almost a one-shot weapon” to higher-quality weapons, he says. In 2025 police say they have so far made seizures of homemade firearms in almost every state and territory. In one suburban home police allege they found 3D printers as well as 3D-printed pistols, magazines and firearm parts. The stash allegedly included a 3D-printed semi-automatic carbine in parts, commonly known online as the Urutau. The blueprints of the Urutau were released online only last year but already components have allegedly been found during police raids in multiple states. In another case, police allegedly found a “Nutty 9” firearm – a spin-off of the FGC-9 – and a 3D-printed pistol as well as the digital blueprint for the manufacture of firearms. Images released by police show a vast array of components allegedly found during the raid, including an incomplete Urutau. Gun parts in the post Rajan Basra, a researcher at King’s College London, says the 3D-printed gun world has become a “social movement”. The Urutau and other models, including perhaps the most infamous 3D-printed firearm, the FGC-9 – or “Fuck Gun Control” – emerge from online communities that share information and promote the creation of weapons both as a means to push the boundaries of science and, according to some designers, “permanently undermine global firearm prohibition”. The Urutau was intentionally designed without the need for regulated parts in some countries – all “with basically [online retail] stuff”, as the man behind the gun’s design said on a podcast in May. An open letter that accompanies the build kit online promotes “the unlimited right to keep and bear arms”. On Discord servers and filesharing websites, this community posts memes and gun rights quotes alongside long lists of projects and links of recommended retailers for buying build kits as well as barrels and parts that cannot be reliably 3D printed. In one case, Australian Border Force allegedly intercepted several shipments sent from China. The packages were allegedly described as “pipes” or “high pressure oil pipe”, according to court documents. Police allege they were “unfinished firearm barrels”. Some groups promote what they call a “new second amendment”, according to Dr Yannick Veilleux-Lepage, an associate professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. Broadly, this is the belief that the right to bear arms is universal, not just part of the US constitution. “This all falls within the same movement, which is essentially trying to push the boundaries of privately manufactured firearms,” he says. “The main impact here is the erosion of state control on firearms.” Worried? ‘Build one yourself’ It’s unclear how many 3D-printed guns are being seized in Australia each year – there is no centralised record – yet an examination of court documents suggests various models are emerging, created both by hobbyists and those intending to use them for criminal purposes. In 2023 a man was sentenced in Melbourne for possessing a traffickable quantity of firearms, six of which were 3D-printed handguns, court documents show, including 0.22 rimfire calibre pistols, as well as aggravated carjacking, among other charges. Some suggest 3D-printed firearms may not be popular among cohorts linked to organised crime, because of a lack of reliability and their aesthetic. “They communicate to other people that you’re not able to source a conventional firearm,” Veilleux-Lepage says. But this could change. Some popular models, such as the “Not-a-Glock”, he says, look like a conventional firearm and are cheap to build. Extremist groups that might not otherwise be able to easily access the illicit market also pose a threat. “Over the last few years … it’s very typical for the gun blueprints to be shared by far-right influencers, along with the instructional material and incitement for followers to make guns at home,” says Basra, who unmasked the man behind the FGC-9 as the already deceased German citizen Jacob Duygu. Artem Vasilyev was sentenced to at least three years in jail in the South Australian supreme court in 2024 after pleading guilty to more than a dozen firearm offences. In his sentencing remarks the judge referred to a report prepared by a forensic psychologist, which said Vasilyev “was in the process of becoming radicalised” and had material “espousing extremist rightwing ideologies” on his electronic devices. The court heard that a plastic tub containing 3D-printed gun parts that could be used to make a FGC-9 firearm was found in his home. In a NSW hearing about whether to put in place an extended supervision order, the court heard how a man who had shared extremist beliefs was found to have downloaded hundreds of 3D-printing files for a number of firearms. Urutau’s anonymous originator, who goes by the handle Joseph the Parrot, was asked on a podcast this year about extremists using his design. “I mean, I don’t support them but if they build a gun I can’t do anything about that,” he said. “If you are upset about a white supremacist building a Urutau, you can build one yourself to counter him.”

7) ‘It happened so fast’: the shocking reality of indoor heat deaths in Arizona — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     It was the hottest day of the year so far when the central air conditioning started blowing hot air in the mobile home where Richard Chamblee lived in Bullhead City, Arizona, with his wife, children, and half a dozen cats and dogs. It was only mid-June but the heat was insufferable, particularly for Chamblee, who was clinically obese and bed-bound in the living room as the temperature hit 115F (46C) in the desert city – situated 100 miles (160km) south of Las Vegas on the banks of the Colorado River. The family could not afford to immediately replace or repair the AC system, so instead they bought a window unit and installed it next to Chamblee’s bed. They positioned fans, ice packs and cold drinks close by in an effort to keep Chamblee cool and hydrated, checking in on him every couple of hours. But the mobile home is old, open-plan and poorly insulated. Despite their efforts, the temperature hovered close to 100F in the house, according to Chamblee’s son John. Chamblee overheated and struggled to breathe. His core temperature measured 108F when he was rushed to the emergency room, but doctors were unable to cool him down, according to the death report obtained by the Guardian using the Freedom of Information Act (Foia). Chamblee’s heart stopped working. He had died just two days after the AC went out. “It was the end of the day and it was cooling off slightly, so we thought he’d be OK. He thought he would be OK,” said his wife, Sherry Chamblee, who works three jobs including as assistant manager at a local grocery store. “We had no idea the heat could be so dangerous so quickly inside. It just happened so fast.” Chamblee was just 52 years old. He was a devout Baptist, smart and happy-go-lucky, and he loved playing video games. “We did our best to cool him down, but we live a couple of hours from Death Valley, the hottest place on Earth, and my dad couldn’t move,” said John, 21. “My mom lives paycheck to paycheck and if the AC breaks down in the summer and you can’t afford to fix it, you will die here. My dad proves that.” Nationwide, one in five of the lowest-income households have no access to air conditioning, while 30% rely solely on window units, according to exclusive analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada) for the Guardian. As many as 60% of American households live paycheck to paycheck, while one in three report forgoing basic necessities such as food or medicine to pay energy bills and avoid disconnection. Heat is the deadliest weather phenomenon in the US and globally, killing almost half a million people worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The death toll is rising as human-caused climate crisis drives more frequent, more brutal and longer heatwaves. Last month marked 30 years since what was then an unprecedented five-day heatwave in Chicago that killed more than 730 people and sent thousands to hospital. The majority were elderly, Black, isolated, low-income residents either lacking air conditioning or the money to run it. Since then, deadly heat domes have hit every corner of the country, including northern states unaccustomed to extreme heat, such as Oregon and Massachusetts. Yet the US has failed to implement a robust methodology to count and understand the scale of the heat-related illnesses and deaths. As the planet heats up, experts warn that indoor heat deaths among elderly, sick and low-income people could surge amid deepening financial hardship driven by Donald Trump’s energy policies, trade wars and his administration’s dismantling of the social safety net. “The United States is being governed by a regime that depends on denying scientific findings from climate science to economics and medical science to sociology,” said Eric Klinenberg, the author of Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago and director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. “We’re not just failing to protect vulnerable people, we’re actively making life here more precarious. And while some will be able to buy their way out of the problem, most people can’t. This is an existential crisis,” said Klinenberg. Energy poverty in the world’s richest country One in three American households experiences energy poverty – the inability to access sufficient amounts of energy due to financial hardship, according to one recent study. And it’s getting worse. The average household electric bill during the summer months, when cooling drives up usage, will reach $784 in 2025 – a 6.2% rise from $737 last year, according to analysis by Neada for the Guardian. This will be the highest recorded in more than a decade, and will place a disproportionate burden on low-income Americans. Families in the south and south-west are disproportionately affected. The Chamblee family experienced severe energy poverty until 2023, when they saved $1,000 to install residential solar panels that qualified for tax credits, and cut the family’s summer electricity bills from around $400 to $60 a month. The federal solar tax credit included in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act ends in December, however, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act – a decade earlier than planned. Trump’s budget will lead to residential electricity bills in Arizona increasing by $220 on average by 2035, by truncating the development of new, cost-effective solar energy capacity in the sunny state, according to analysis by Energy Innovation. Trump’s signature legislation will also slash access to food stamps and healthcare, relied upon by millions of low-income households, in order to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. Nationwide, meanwhile, his unprecedented and chaotic rollback of federal incentives and permits led to the cancellation of $22bn of clean energy projects in the first six months of 2025, more than half in Republican states. Earlier this month, Arizona’s Republican-controlled regulator also voted to begin the process of repealing the state’s renewable standard, which required that at least 15% of utility energy supplies should come from renewable sources by 2025. Consumer and environmental advocates – and the state’s attorney general – warn the move will further drive up energy bills. And in Arizona and across the country, private utilities have submitted proposals for multibillion-dollar rate increases, in order to cover infrastructure upgrades, inflation and new fossil fuel projects – driven, at least partially, by the unchecked expansion of massive datacentres promoted by the Trump administration. “Families are already struggling with high energy bills, and forcing them to cross-subsidize some of the world’s wealthiest corporations violates both fairness and common sense,” said Mark Wolfe, an energy economist and director of Neada. “It will worsen energy poverty, erode public trust, and turn utilities into vehicles for corporate welfare.” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, dismissed criticism of Trump’s energy policy as “fearmongering”. “The best source of energy in a heat wave is baseload energy from coal and natural gas, which the president has unleashed and made more affordable, not intermittent energy sources like solar,” Rogers said. “By increasing energy production, eliminating burdensome regulations, and streamlining permitting, President Trump is ensuring that US energy meets the energy demands for heat waves, data centers, and grid stability.” Energy … on the credit card Household utility debt is reaching crisis levels, jumping from $17.5bn in January 2023 to $21bn in June 2025 and forecast to climb as high as $25bn by the end of this year. Currently, only 26 states and the District of Columbia have rules restricting some utility shutoffs over the summer, and disconnections could hit 4m by the end of 2025, according to Neada. Amid soaring energy costs, shrinking federal aid, hotter summers and a zip code lottery when it comes to utility disconnection rules, health experts warn that households on fixed incomes and those with medical issues such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and addictions will be most vulnerable. “These are preventable deaths, and the situation is going to get worse as bills go up and hardship increases,” said Vjollca Berisha, a former senior epidemiologist at the Maricopa county department of public health who tracked energy insecurity and indoor deaths. “It only takes a little push to knock down people with underlying conditions if they don’t have options.” In Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix, last year, almost a quarter of the 608 confirmed heat-related fatalities happened inside, with people over 50 accounting for the vast majority of those who died at home. A quarter of the county’s indoor deaths took place in RVs or mobile homes, a popular source of affordable housing, especially for retirees, but which are often poorly insulated and too rundown to qualify for weatherization programs. The vast majority of those indoor heat victims had AC at home, but the unit was broken in 70% of cases – while one in 10 had no electricity to run even a fan, according to Maricopa county’s 2024 report. Patricia Miletich, a 70-year-old woman with memory issues, died in June 2024 at a 55+ RV resort with pickleball courts, a golf course and bistro in the hot and dusty city of El Mirage north-west of Phoenix. According to her autopsy report obtained by the Guardian, a neighbor told death investigators that Miletich had forgotten to pay her bills on multiple occasions, resulting in her electricity being turned off in the past. The power was on when she died, but the AC was not functioning. Like Chamblee’s, it blew hot air from the vents, between 109F and 117F. The resort’s manager confirmed to the Guardian that Miletich’s power had been disconnected several times, but declined to answer further questions about what support the retiree received. “It’s a sad situation that should never have happened, but she wanted to be left alone and the family didn’t know” about her memory decline and electricity shutoffs, said her brother Michael Miletich. In nearby Mohave county, a Guardian analysis of death reports obtained under Foia found that 70% of the 67 confirmed heat-related deaths in 2024 occurred indoors – of which the vast majority lived in RVs or mobile homes. This includes Stephen Patterson in Lake Havasu City, a 69-year-old with multiple health challenges tied to a childhood road traffic accident, chronic pain and alcohol addiction. Patterson relied on his $1,000 monthly social security check – the sole source of income for around 40% of seniors, according to one 2020 study. According to Regina, his sister and main carer, Patterson rationed his AC use because he believed he could cope with the heat but not without alcohol. He also incorrectly blamed the AC for a mold issue. When he died, the temperature inside Stephen’s house was 102F, according to the medical examiner’s report. The daily high in Lake Havasu City was 116F. “I begged him to turn on the AC,” said Regina, who is 75 and, like her brother, is also on a fixed social security income. “I would have paid his bill on my credit card, but my brother was a stubborn man. It was like a furnace when I found him.” Regina uses credit cards to pay her electric bill, currently $211 a month, as well as her water, trash, car insurance and cable. The cards charge as much as 35% interest. Around 60% of her monthly income covers the house payment, and the rest goes to service the credit card debt, which currently stands at more than $12,000 – in addition to almost $1,000 owed to the energy company. She diligently documents each month’s payments and remaining credit in an A4 notebook that sits on the coffee table next to the TV remote. Regina has been disconnected multiple times over the years, but has received some financial help from the Salvation Army and Goodwill to avoid a shutoff. Yet she was unaware of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap), the chronically underfunded federal program to help families pay their energy bills, which the Trump administration proposed cutting after firing the entire workforce in April. In Arizona, 24,000 households received Liheap assistance in the 2025 fiscal year. A third of recipients included a household member with a disability or children under six, while 16% included an older adult. Liheap was saved amid bipartisan protests, but its future remains uncertain. Arizona, where heat deaths are known to occur from April to November, currently only has enough funds to help struggling families through the end of September. On his first day back in the White House, Trump declared a national energy emergency, promising to lower prices by boosting fossil fuels and rolling back Joe Biden’s renewable energy ambitions. To Regina Patterson, it all now rings hollow. “The price of everything keeps going up and I get into more debt every month. Trump is evil and only cares about the rich,” she said. “If I were to lose my electric in this heat, I would lose my head.”

8) I’m a liberal who loves hunting. Allow me to change your mind — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     “Murderer! You’re a murderer!” That is what my French mother shouts down the phone line – right after I tell her I had grouse for dinner. “Grouse?” she gasps. “Yes,” I say, using my nonchalant voice. “We went hunting and shot two of them. Plump ones. I braised them in a mushroom broth and served them with stewed apples and potato mash.” She shrieks. “I can’t believe you killed an animal!” “Mom! Didn’t you just make lamb tagine?” Pause. “Yes, I cooked a Moroccan tagine with raisins, green olives and a lot of cinnamon,” she replies defensively. “I made it with lamb I bought at the farmers’ market. What’s your point?” “My point is,” I say, “where do you think that lamb came from? Did it magically appear on your plate?” It was not a conversation I was going to win, not even with a French woman living in the land of duck foie gras, cured pork sausage and snails – all of which was killed far less humanely than the grouse on my plate. That is what I was trying to tell Mom: hunting may be morally complex, but it is a far more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than the factory-farmed products most people eat. I am not arguing for everyone to go out and hunt their dinner – that would be absurd. But the reflexive disdain for hunters on much of the left feels misplaced. Let me explain. *** If I truly am a murderer, I am not a very vicious one. I killed my first mule deer on public land in northern Montana at the tail end of a five-hour hunt in frigid temperatures on Thanksgiving. My partner and I had been tracking signs all day – hiking up and down ridges, glassing hillsides with binoculars – until I could not feel my toes. We were ready to give up when the curious eyes of two does landed on us. With their oversized ears and mile-long eyelashes, they looked dainty and otherworldly, as if they had stepped out of a Grimm fairy tale. The one in front, maybe 80 yards (73 metres) away, studied me. She had one leg slightly raised, the others rooted in snow, frozen in that split-second decision: flee or stay? Mule deer are naturally more curious and less skittish than their white-tailed cousins, which gave me a crucial edge. I had one extra heartbeat to steady my breath, nestle the rifle into my shoulder, and count to three while exhaling. I pulled the trigger. The shot echoed across the ridge. The doe’s knees buckled and she collapsed. My chest seized – I wanted to give the doe a quick death. I reloaded and fired again, trying to stay steady as adrenaline coursed through my body. I walked to her, stroked her soft ears and burst into tears. Looking back, I am not embarrassed by my reaction; it seemed fitting to the gravity of the experience. In that instant – and there is really no other way to describe it – I felt an immense surge of love for that animal. It reminds me of what the British philosopher Julian Baggini has wondered about modern food gathering: is disgust at meat eating really a sign of a more civilized society, or simply a mark of one that has become detached from the realities of life and death? *** My ascent to the world of hunting was not linear. I moved to the United States 10 years ago, carrying with me the wide-eyed fascination so many French people have for America. I had a slightly embarrassing love for its excess, its swagger, the bigness of it all. But more than that, it was the land – from the Redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, as the song goes – that felt like freedom for me. During my first year in New York City, I befriended Caty and Ryan, two journalists recently transplanted from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Everything about their lives struck me as exotic. Their hallway was cluttered with skis, climbing gear and camping equipment that suggested a life lived outdoors. Mountaineering magazines were strewn on the dining table, and a print of Ansel Adams’s celebrated photograph of the high desert hung on their kitchen wall, austere and magnetic. Soon, Ryan taught me how to fly fish in the rivers of upstate New York – a hobby so quintessentially American I thought it came with its own Yankee passport. Standing in the Beaverkill river, casting in cold thigh-high waters, I was enthralled. When I caught my first rainbow trout, I held its iridescent body underwater and gasped at its beauty. I removed the hook from its mouth and let it go. That winter, Ryan prepared a meal that shifted everything I thought I knew about hunting. Over candlelight, he brought out quails he had shot that fall in his native North Dakota. They had been braised for five hours in apple cider and sage. Silence fell on the table as we ate. Each bite came with the appreciation of what it took for it to reach our plates: a punishing cross-country road trip followed by freezing mornings traipsing through fields with Magnolia, his trusty hunting Labrador, by his side. This food carried a story that was a far cry from the plastic-wrapped slabs of meat stacked in supermarket coolers, and far more interesting. *** *** Hunting has always had a terrible reputation in France, especially in affluent cities. In the court of public opinion – especially on the political left, where my heart is firmly anchored – hunters are viewed with suspicion, if not outright contempt. It is not without reason. Hunting has long been associated with a retrograde political party formerly called Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition, a right-leaning group that seemed to be populated by portly men who sported mustaches and red cheeks, and had an inclination to drink wine before noon. Now, hunting still only makes headlines when accidents happen. So perhaps it is no surprise the sport is in decline: perception matters. In France, about 58% of hunting permit holders are aged 55 or older, and only 3% are women. In the UK, where I lived for eight years, hunting is mostly seen as an upper-class pursuit, and the lingering stain of fox hunting makes it hard to separate the sport in the public eye from cruelty. But in the US, hunting is more widely practiced across groups – even across party lines. Kamala Harris’s former running mate, Tim Walz, for example, is a dedicated wild turkey hunter in Minnesota. In Missoula, where I live – a blue dot in a red state – my hunting community includes conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts, university lecturers and, more prosaically, people simply looking to fill the freezer. There are plenty of Maga types too, I am sure – they are just not in my social circles. Native tribes across the state, who overwhelmingly skew Democrat, hold hunting rights for both big and small game on their lands; their ancestral foodways are considered sacred. More women than ever before are joining the ranks. I am one of them. So is my friend DeAnna Bublitz, who wanted to be more intentional with her meat consumption. “I figured that if I couldn’t pull the trigger myself, I should probably stop eating meat,” she says. But entering the hunting world dominated by older men felt intimidating. “I was lucky to have a female friend who is a top-notch hunter and willing to loan me gear and mentor me. That made all the difference,” she says. “There are a lot of barriers for folks who didn’t grow up hunting – cost and mentorship are two of the biggest in my mind.” The experience transformed her. Her mentor not only taught her practical skills but also helped her process the complicated emotions that come with killing an animal. Eventually, DeAnna started Deer Camp, a free gear library for hunters, and now mentors new hunters herself – including me. “The folks I see expressing interest want to eat healthier, more ethical meat and they’re a more diverse crowd – often younger, with a lot of women and people from the LGBTQIA+ community. But those same groups may not feel safe going into the woods alone or with a stranger. How we depict hunting in media, and who we choose to represent it, can go a long way in either making people feel welcome or shutting them out. The experiences you can have out there are incredible, though – fostering new friendships alongside a sense of stewardship for the land.” In other words, if you are concerned with the health of our ecosystems, maybe – just maybe – I could change your mind. *** Perhaps this is where I should address the elephant in the room: firearms. In the US, thanks to the 1937 Pittman-Robertson Act, taxes on firearms and ammunition are funneled directly into wildlife conservation and habitat restoration. Over the decades, it has generated more than $15bn. Hunters are required to take a gun safety course, which means we start out more educated about risks than the broader gun-owning population. While I would love to call myself an archer, which arguably demands more skills, most of us use rifles: they are accurate and they tend to make for a quicker death. Still, I feel deep ambivalence about firearms. Gun culture unsettles me, and the proliferation of semi-automatic weapons in particular terrifies me. I cannot imagine a world where assault-style rifles belong in civilian hands – let alone with 18-year-olds. I often think of Australia, a country with plenty of big-game hunters, where a single mass shooting in 1996 prompted sweeping reform led by a conservative government. That policy shift ended mass shootings (and firearm suicides dropped, too). It is the kind of success story I wish we could claim here. What makes it harder to stomach is how far the NRA has drifted. Once an organization rooted in hunting and safety, it has become a cynical lobby that trades in fear and division. Take Ryan Busse, a longtime gun executive and keen hunter. He quit his role after watching the gun lobby embrace far-right politics to make a buck – then ran for governor of Montana last year (he lost). Writing in the Guardian, he argued that “it’s up to responsible gun owners and others who care about our country to speak out against [the gun lobby’s] egregiously irresponsible behavior and in favor of commonsense laws like universal background checks and extreme risk protection orders”. Stories like his underline what often gets lost: for many hunters, firearms are a means to an end, not an identity. *** *** I often think of this: hunters and vegetarians – both judged by others, both right – are more alike than either would admit. It is a complex comparison, but consider this: both think deeply about what they eat. They spend a lot of time pondering food ethics: good quality sustenance, preferably sourced locally. Both care about ecosystems and how to preserve them for future generations. Both worry about animal welfare. And yet in western society, veganism holds the moral high ground. Never mind that many plant-based products come shrink-wrapped in plastic and shipped across oceans. The ingredients in vegan snacks – soy, palm oil, cacao, quinoa, coconut, bananas – are rarely local; they rely on extractive systems, exploitative labor and long-distance freight. Large-scale monocropping for soy, corn and wheat depletes soil and accelerates biodiversity loss. This is not a purity test. All I am saying is that eating ethically today is nearly impossible – vegan or not. But most wild game meat? It is sustainable, when conservation practices are observed. And I would argue that it is the most ethical meat one can consume. “Hunters are removing animals, that’s true,” Rebecca Mowry, a wildlife biologist with Montana fish, wildlife and parks, told me. “But they also tend to be extremely passionate about those animals, and deeply invested in making sure they’re still here for future generations.” Each year, state biologists like her set hunting quotas to address overpopulation. Hunters then pay for licenses – or enter lotteries for tags – and those fees directly support wildlife management programs. This system exists for a reason: unchecked animal populations can cause real damage. Deer and hogs, for example, can overgraze and destroy entire ecosystems. In France, the National Forestry Office warns that more than 50% of state-owned forests are ecologically out of balance due to exploding populations of deer, roe deer and wild boar. In Texas, feral hogs are so invasive they are costing millions in the agriculture industry – this very newspaper called it “an aporkalypse”. Mowry says hunting “is a very valuable tool to help manage ecosystems, for multiple reasons”. Without enough predators or healthy migration corridors, she explained, big game populations can balloon beyond what the land can support. “We’re not living in untouched wilderness anymore,” she says. “With all the development on winter range, we’ve altered the balance – and hunting helps restore it.” In his book How the World Eats, Baggini, the British philosopher, describes the Hadza, Tanzania’s last hunter-gatherer society. “They move with the seasons,” he writes, “taking from the natural environment only what they need to survive, leaving it able to replenish itself – so that any extraction of resources can go on indefinitely.” That, Baggini observes, is the very definition of sustainability. Thosh Collins, an Indigenous health educator, author and experienced hunter, echoed this when he told me: “When we harvest, process and cook our food, we’re literally taking the land into our bodies.” His family also seasonally forages on their land in the Arizona desert and grows traditional foods such as corn, bean and squash. For Collins, meat carries spirit – not just calories. “From the Indigenous perspective, a hunter possesses the ability to transform death into nourishment,” he says. “One of the most fascinating paradoxes of our lives is that life feeds off of death. Life energy crosses from one form to another. No one person is exempt from this. If you’re living, you’re taking up space from other sentient life forms trying to thrive.” His O’odham ancestors never separated sustenance from reverence, and neither does he. After a kill, he performs a giving-of-thanks ritual to help send the animal’s spirit on. Nothing about the act is casual; everything is deliberate. Part of what makes a hunter successful is the ability to know the habitat they are in: you have to learn to read the land, understand how changing seasons affect species, and how fires, droughts and climate shifts shape entire ecosystems. Which is why I do not know any group – aside from Native tribes and biologists – more attuned to the health of elk herds, the decline of pronghorns, or the migration patterns of Canada geese than hunters. Yes, hunters kill animals. But Mowry, the Montana biologist, also points out hunters “are largely responsible for some of the most successful wildlife restorations in the country”. How? They fight for public land access – and helped win a political battle earlier this year. They campaign for clean water, wildlife corridors and the removal of barbed-wire fences that kill mule deer and antelope. They report poachers. They fill out wildlife surveys that provide essential data to state officials. Some groups lobby against encroaching development; others build education programs. Many donate meat to food banks. They mentor newcomers, volunteer their time and skills, and open their tables to others. In other words, hunters do not just understand interconnectedness – they live it. Can we all say the same? *** *** After seven years in New York, I moved out west to Montana with my partner Ben, an enthusiastic outdoorsman. The move to the Rockies was a culture shock: I left skyscrapers for snow-capped mountains, $23 cocktails in Manhattan for sticky floors in boisterous dive bars. It was also the perfect terrain to learn how to hunt my own meat. The learning curve was steep. For months, Ben patiently fielded my endless questions: how do you follow a game trail? When do bucks rut – and why do their lymph nodes swell? What’s an elk herd’s migration pattern? Should I worry about chronic wasting disease? I had to learn how to move in the woods: slowly, methodically, discerning broken branches, bedding areas or fresh droppings. I practiced reading wind direction using a neat little indicator powder, studied how to scan hillsides using binoculars, and mastered the art of opening snacks without making any noise. Still, I was afraid I would not be able to carry the responsibility of taking an animal’s life. I had to remind myself that by my standards eating a burger at McDonald’s or chicken strips at my local bar was a worse choice. I studied and passed the hunter safety course. I joined Venery, a women’s hunting group, and spent time with them at the shooting range, familiarizing myself with a tool that until then had been foreign and terrifying to me: a .308 Winchester rifle. Learning with other women gave me the confidence I needed to later go in the field, where I had both amazing and dispiriting experiences. Hunting, after all, is never a promise — it’s unpredictable, and often hard. To kill is to bear witness to the cycle of life. No longer can you outsource the unpleasantness – not to Whole Foods, not to Lidl, not even to your local farmer. Digging your fingers through the entrails, you take ultimate responsibility for your own sustenance. I hesitate to say this, but it is an elating feeling: with it comes a sense of self-reliance long forgotten, especially when everything you would ever want can be delivered to you overnight by underpaid delivery workers. Hunting is the opposite of that: it is patient, demanding, gnarly. It comes with smells, textures and colors rarely seen by anyone eating commercial meat. It is also new language: as you spend days climbing hills and crossing marshes for a chance to complete the task, you live in the present. Collins, the O’odham hunter, told me that his sister is a former vegan. Now, she “will only eat the meat my dad and I hunt because she knows we did it with a good heart and mind and that a ceremony was performed for the buck to send his spirit to rejoin his relatives”. For Collins, hunting is part of a broader circle of sustenance passed down from his ancestors. It’s not just about the meat, but about gratitude, ceremony and a sense of duty. “Foodways is about doing things on the land with people you love, for people you love,” he said. *** These days, I eat far less store-bought meat – though I will admit a weakness for poultry, a whole ethical mess of its own. Instead, we often have elk backstraps, ground venison and summer sausage – all processed at home, wrapped in butcher paper adorned with handwritten details and the processing date on it, stacked deep in my freezer chest. Last fall, I killed a young whitetail buck. Ben and I butchered it in two hours, under the sun filtering through the ponderosa pines. We took with us tenderloins, backstraps, shanks, legs, with leftovers going to scavengers – nothing going to waste. Back home, I marinated the deer’s heart – a perfectly tender piece of meat – in a mixture of soy, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, thyme and vinegar. I grilled it alongside a pile of red peppers, zucchinis and onions, and served it with buttered sourdough bread. My golden retriever, Billie, happy to act as my sous chef, ate the scraps. Forest to plate, in under 48 hours.

9) ‘I’m holding his political wake’: the trumpeter waiting to mark Bolsonaro’s judgment day — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     When Jair Bolsonaro was Brazil’s far-right president, the guerrilla trumpeter Fabiano Leitão would stalk him around the capital, Brasília, to taunt him with renditions of the anti-fascist anthem Bella Ciao. In March, when Bolsonaro was charged with plotting a coup, Leitão changed his tune and began provoking the ex-president by serenading him with Chopin’s Funeral March. “It symbolises his political demise, which is what we want to see,” said the 46-year-old musician. Now, as the supreme court prepares to decide whether to send Bolsonaro to jail for that alleged power grab, Leitão is cooking up another performance to commemorate the populist’s downfall and disgrace. “It’ll be something happy! It has to be something happy!” enthused the trumpeter, crooning one of the upbeat samba classics he was considering to mark the occasion. “Cry! I won’t care!” smirk the lyrics of Vou Festejar. “I’m going to celebrate your suffering [and] your grief!” Leitão is among millions of progressive Brazilians who have the metaphorical champagne on ice ahead of the widely anticipated conviction of Bolsonaro and seven alleged co-conspirators when their judgment begins this week. Seven years after the former paratrooper swept to power on a wave of social media-fuelled anti-establishment voter rage, and three after voters removed him from office, Bolsonaro is careering towards the lowest point of his 35-year political career. On Tuesday, five supreme court judges will convene in Brasília to rule on whether Bolsonaro is guilty of masterminding a failed coup after losing the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – and, if so, how long he should spend in jail. Legal experts believe Bolsonaro’s conviction is all but guaranteed during a judgment expected to last five sessions, between 2 September and 12 September. His sentence could reach 43 years, meaning the 70-year-old grandfather could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Bolsonaro stands accused of five crimes including involvement in an armed criminal organisation, coup d’état and violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. Prosecutors have claimed one part of the sprawling conspiracy, codenamed Operation Green and Yellow Dagger, included plans to sow chaos – and justify a military intervention – by murdering Lula, his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, and Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court judge, who is now overseeing Bolsonaro’s trial. Federal police investigators allege the pro-Bolsonaro coup only failed because the heads of the army and air force, Gen Marco Antônio Freire Gomes and Brig Gen Carlos de Almeida Baptista Júnior, refused to take part. The navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos, who is one of the seven alleged accomplices also standing trial, has been accused of offering his support, charges he denies. “The [prosecution’s] closing arguments are really hard-hitting – there’s so much evidence … It’s really hard to imagine an acquittal,” Eloísa Machado, a constitutional law expert from the Getulio Vargas Foundation law school, said of Bolsonaro. Such predictions are music to the ears of Leitão, the activist trumpeter, who hopes judges will throw the book at a politician he blames for trying to wreck Brazilian democracy and destroying Brazilian lives. During Bolsonaro’s 2019-2022 presidency, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians were killed by a Covid pandemic that the ex-president was accused of mishandling with his anti-scientific response and sluggish purchase of vaccines. “It’s going to be a moment of joy to see the country free itself of this instrument of destruction,” said Leitão, whom fans call the “Trompetista” – a play on the words “trumpeter” and “petista”, as members of Lula’s Worker’s party (PT) are known. “We always complain about our democracy and how fragile it is. But we’re doing much better than the United States, which never arrested Trump.” In the run-up to this week’s judgment, Donald Trump, who is Bolsonaro’s most powerful foreign friend, has waded into the courtroom drama, imposing sanctions on Moraes, the justice leading the trial, and 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports in protest at the supposed “witch-hunt” against his ally. “It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to do with Bolsonaro,” Trump declared recently. Bolsonaro’s third son, the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, has relocated to the US and busied himself lobbying Trump officials to target Brazil’s top tribunal and Lula allies such as the health minister, whose wife and daughter were stripped of their US visas. “Trump is our only way out,” the president of Bolsonaro’s Liberal party, Valdemar Costa Neto, recently told reporters. Analysts believe the US coercion campaign will fail to sway the judges who will decide Bolsonaro’s fate. In a rare interview on the eve of the judgment, Moraes vowed to shrug off US pressure. “There isn’t the smallest of possibilities of retreating even one millimetre,” he told the Washington Post. “We’ll do what’s right: we’ll receive the accusation, analyse the evidence, and who should be convicted shall be convicted, and who should be absolved shall be absolved.” Bolsonaro, who was placed under house arrest in early August after violating a court order banning him from using social media, denies engineering a coup. He has admitted considering “alternative” ways of retaining power after his election defeat. The ex-president continues to insist he will challenge Lula for the presidency in next year’s election, although the supreme court has already barred him from seeking office until 2030 for spreading disinformation. After hearing that Bolsonaro had been confined to his mansion a short drive from the presidential palace he once occupied, Leitão grabbed his trumpet and rushed to the scene. As night fell, the musician raised his instrument to his lips outside the gates of Bolsonaro’s home and played an unusually cheery excerpt from Chopin’s Piano Sonata No 2 into the night. “The message is that it’s over,” the guerrilla trumpeter said after his work was done. “I’m holding his political wake – and the burial is imminent.”

10) Ghislaine Maxwell hinted at Epstein’s ties to Trump officials – why wasn’t she pressed for names? — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     As deputy US attorney Todd Blanche announced last week that the justice department would release transcripts of his interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, he described this disclosure as being “in the interest of transparency”. “Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,” Blanche also said of his two-day sit down with Maxwell, who was convicted sex trafficking in relation to Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls. That same day, James Comer, the House oversight committee chair, said that the justice department had sent a large tranche of Epstein investigative documents in response to a congressional subpoena. Comer praised justice officials and Donald Trump, saying: “The Trump DoJ is moving at a pace far faster than anything ever produced by the Biden DoJ.” Trump, who has faced extensive political blowback over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files, also voiced support for transparency. “I’m in support of them keeping it open. Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open,” he said. While those supportive of Trump have touted these actions as a show of openness, many others have pointed to the questions left unasked – and the people who have not been asked anything at all – as indicating that these disclosures about Epstein were more of a show than any real push for truth. For them the Maxwell transcripts, and the ignoring of victim’s voices, are not a sign of openness; they are a sign of a reluctance to pursue any potentially dangerous truth. For example, Blanche asked Maxwell whether people around Epstein – including the numerous high-profile and powerful men who had known him – were associating with him for the purpose of sexual encounters. In her reply Maxwell said that some of the “cast of characters” around Epstein were “in your cabinet, who you value as your co-workers”. Despite the fact that Maxwell had just openly mentioned Epstein associates as being in Trump’s current cabinet, Blanche – a hardened lawyer not known for missing a trick in trial argument – did not pause to ask Maxwell to identify the cabinet members she was referring to. At another point in the interview, Blanche asked Maxwell had ever had contact with Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency. “Well, not deliberately,” Maxwell said. Blanche responded: “Pardon me?” She again said “not deliberately” and Blanche then moved on to a question about whether Epstein was receiving money from any intelligence agency. Blanche also seemed to indulge Maxwell’s repeated professions of spotty recollection, including in response to questions about whether Trump penned a letter for Epstein’s birthday book, as had been reported by the Wall Street Journal. Blanche, prefacing a question with the phrase, “I understand you don’t remember anything with President Trump or a lot about the book anyway,” asked: “Do you remember asking President Trump to submit a letter for that?” Maxwell said: “I do not.” “Do you remember – would you have been the one to do that or could somebody else – would somebody else have done that?” Blanche asked. “I did ask some people. I don’t remember Mr Trump. I don’t remember who I did ask, but Epstein also asked people himself directly.” Blanche responded: “OK.” He did not pursue the obvious line of thought that Maxwell’s response suggested: had Epstein reached out to Trump? Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is the founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said: “Many of Blanche’s questions were surface-level and didn’t drill down the way lawyers, especially prosecutors, do when they want to catch inconsistencies.” “She has zero credibility and I don’t believe for a second that she saw nothing and knows nothing,” Rahmani said. “Perhaps Blanche’s questions were more of the softball variety, but there was no world where Maxwell was going to implicate herself when she has her supreme court appeal pending or anyone in the administration when she is trying to get a presidential pardon.” For victims’ representatives and advocates, the issue with unasked questions also extends to who hasn’t been asked questions. Several attorneys, representing more than a total of 50 Epstein and Maxwell, survivors told the Guardian that the justice department had not reached out for sit-downs with them. “Despite the fact that we have successfully represented 11 Epstein victims, no one has reached out,” said attorney Lisa Bloom. Spencer Kuvin, who has represented multiple Epstein survivors, commented: “We have heard nothing from the DoJ or the house subcommittee regarding request to speak with either the attorneys for the victims or the victims. I have repeatedly advised that I am willing to volunteer to provide testimony at their request. The victims have been ignored in this entire process.” Another attorney said: “I have received updates from the justice department, but no requests to speak to my clients.” Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky, who filed sexual harassment suits against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and co-founded the non-profit Lift Our Voices, said that the approach has ignored those who were abused by Epstein and Maxwell. “If they actually had survivors in mind, if you were thoughtful about them, they would be able to talk to them, and then we’d be consulting subscribers and lawyers to make sure inquiries were unfolding in the way they wanted,” Carlson said. “Nobody is doubting that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked young girls. Nobody is doubting that Jeffrey Epstein was not the only man who raped these young girls,” Roginsky said. “All we need to do is listen to these survivors as they tell us who these others are.” “Ghislaine Maxwell is a convicted sex trafficker and felon who has been previously accused of lying under oath. Her conversations with United States deputy attorney general Todd Blanche reveal nothing shocking; Maxwell provided a version of the truth that best suits her agenda, in an attempt to continue concealing her wrongdoings,” said Jennifer Freeman, an attorney for Epstein survivors and special counsel at Marsh Law Firm. “For far too long survivors have been left in the dark, shut out and shunted aside from receiving vital information in their most painful hours.” The House oversight committee says it is in contact with Epstein survivors and that there will be a bipartisan meeting with them on 2 September. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat on the oversight committee, said in a statement that just 3% of the documents the justice department gave to the committee were new and that “the rest are already in the public domain.” “Less than 1% of files have been released. DoJ is stonewalling. The survivors deserve justice and the public deserves transparency.” Khanna said he is holding a press conference with survivors on 3 September to “hear from them why releasing this information is so important”. Asked about Blanche’s interview style or whether there had been any outreach to victims, the justice department said “no comment.”

11) How Trump and corporations have hobbled US labor watchdog — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Biden administration, was one of the first officials to be fired by Donald Trump once he took office in January. She wasn’t the last. Since then, Trump has fired a slew of government officials, including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) chair, Gwynne Wilcox, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, and most recently, he has attempted to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. Abruzzo served at the agency for nearly 30 years before Trump fired her in January 2025, a move recommended in Project 2025. Now she is warning that the attacks on the US’s top labor watchdog threaten to return workers’ rights to levels unseen since 1935 and empower corporations to run roughshod over the agency. “My fear is that if this continues, where corporations and corporate billionaire donors have an outsized voice and directly influence our democracy, we’re going to find ourselves living in an environment such as what we lived in before 1935 when the National Labor Relations Act was enacted,” said Abruzzo. “Working families will be dealing with lower wages, substandard working conditions, and no real channels for them to fight back.” In May, the supreme court declined to reinstate Wilcox while she challenges Trump’s decision to terminate her without cause. A lower court will now have to rule on the issue, with the supreme court likely to follow on appeal. In the meantime, the agency’s powers have been effectively blocked and, Abruzzo worries, worse may be to come. The move was seen by opponents as a challenge to a landmark 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v United States, that ruled Congress can limit the president’s power to remove officials from independent administrative agencies. Abruzzo worries that Wilcox’s firing could pave the way for the National Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935 to federally protect workers’ rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining, to be repealed entirely. “If the supreme court majority eliminates or limits the reach of Humphrey’s Executor and allows the president to fire decision-making officials in the executive branch, including at the NLRB, at his whim, then I anticipate the next step will be figuring out whether or not, if they are found unconstitutional, those provisions should be severed, or the whole [NLRA] act could conceivably be repealed,” Abruzzo said. In the meantime, Abruzzo argues, the NLRB has been rendered toothless. “It’s going to take years to sort out, the agency’s going to be completely ineffective in enforcing the statute, and working families are going to continue to suffer and not be able to get any redress for the violations of their rights. It’s why I think states need to step in and protect their citizenry.” Major corporations are already making ground against the agency after the ruling. On 19 August, the US court of appeals fifth circuit ruled preliminary injunctions halting unfair labor practice cases against Elon Musk’s SpaceX and two other employers can remain in place as the employers’ challenge the constitutionality of the NLRB. The NLRB declined to comment. SpaceX did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “I think we’re going to see a flood of employers forum shopping and flocking into district courts in the fifth circuit area seeking to get preliminary injunctions preventing the NLRB cases that frankly are seeking to hold corporations accountable for their law breaking from moving forward, and that’s going to put an end to the NLRB being able to enforce the act in any meaningful way,” said Abruzzo. “This is all about elevating corporate interests above workers’ rights.” The firings have also left the NLRB without a quorum throughout most of the Trump administration, rendering it unable to issue decisions on cases. In January 2025, after Trump fired Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve as chair of the NLRB board. Trump nominated two members to the board. They are awaiting a vote in the Senate for confirmation, while the term of one of two remaining board members, Marvin Kaplan, expired on 27 August. The agency has also proposed a 4.7% budget cut of $14m for fiscal year 2026, after noting the agency expects to lose nearly 10% of its staff to voluntary resignation and early retirements. The acting general counsel of the NLRB argued earlier this month that the board “has largely been unaffected” by the lack of quorum. But since Trump took office, the NLRB has only issued six decisions compared with fiscal year 2024, when the board issued 259 decisions. “Unless an employer is willing to go along with what the board says, the employer can stall a case indefinitely right now,” said Lauren McFerran, who served as chair of the NLRB during the Biden administration and as a board member from December 2014 to December 2019 and again in July 2020 to January 2021. “So whether it’s a [union] election case, whether it’s an unfair labor practice case, the minute the employer says that they’re not willing to go along and that they want to raise an objection to the board, you’re stuck for the foreseeable future at this point,” added McFerran. Abruzzo argues the firing of Wilcox by Trump, if allowed to stand by the courts, would eliminate the independence of the NLRB in favor of corporations. It’s up to the public to push back on these trends of stripping away protections for workers at the behest of wealthy, powerful corporations and billionaires like Musk, she said. “There is strength in numbers, and we all need to remember we matter. We make an impact on each other’s lives each and every day, and we can’t let the voice of corporate billionaires drown out our voices or squelch our actions and our spirit,” said Abruzzo. “We’re not powerless, and we have the power to demand changes to the way we’re governed, to the way we live our lives. That includes taking to the streets, frankly, and protesting over inadequate wages and working conditions and over economic, social and racial injustice. We need to do more in amplifying our voices, to make sure we’re heard and that actions are taken that are going to benefit us, because that’s, in my opinion, how the tactic of divide and conquer is going to be vanquished.”

12) ‘He’s trying to rig the midterms’: Trump intervenes to protect his allies in Congress — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     They are more than a year away – a lifetime in today’s fast and furious political cycle. But one man is already paying attention, pulling the levers of power and trying to tip the scales of the 2026 midterm elections. Donald Trump has made clear that he is willing to bring the full weight of the White House to bear to prevent his Republican party losing control of the US Congress in the midterm elections next year, orchestrating a more direct and legally dubious intervention than any of his predecessors. The US president’s multipronged approach includes redrawing congressional district maps, seeking to purge voter rolls, taking aim at mail-in voting and voting machines, and ordering the justice department to investigate Democrats’ prime fundraising tool. “Nobody’s ever tried to do this,” said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington. “Most American presidents, Democratic or Republican, have basically played by the same rules and been careful of the constitution. But in his business career Trump never cared about whether he was doing something legal or not; he just went to court and same thing here.” Campaigning, not governing, has often been Trump’s comfort zone. He is constitutionally barred from running for president again but already has an eye on the November 2026 elections that will determine control of the House of Representatives and Senate. He senses that law and order, a populist cause long exploited by Republicans, could play to his advantage. Earlier this month Trump deployed the national guard to reduce crime in Washington DC and threatened similar federal interventions in other big cities. Fifty-three per cent of the public approve of how he is handling crime, according to an AP-NORC poll, higher than other issues. Trump told a cabinet meeting this week: “I think crime will be the big subject of the midterms and will be the big subject of the next election. I think it’s going to be a big, big subject for the midterms and I think the Republicans are going to do really well.” But this is no ordinary campaign. Trump said at the same marathon meeting: “I have the right to do anything I want to do. I’m the president of the United States.” Taking a familiar political manoeuvre to new extremes, he has pushed Republican state legislators in Texas to redraw their congressional map because he claims “we are entitled to five more seats”, and he is lobbying other red states, including Indiana and Missouri, to take similar steps to pad the margin even more. Other steps involve the direct use of official presidential power in ways that have no modern precedent. He ordered his justice department to investigate ActBlue, an online portal that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in small-dollar donations for Democratic candidates over two decades. The site has been so successful that Republicans launched a similar venture, called WinRed. But Trump did not order a federal investigation into WinRed. Trump’s appointees at the justice department have also demanded voting data from at least 19 states in an apparent attempt to look for ineligible voters. Earlier this year he signed an executive order seeking documented proof of citizenship to register to vote, among other changes, though much of it has been blocked by courts. Last week the president announced that lawyers were drafting an executive order to end mail-in balloting, a method used by nearly one in three Americans, and threatened to do away with voting machines. He claimed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told him mail-in voting was responsible for his 2020 election loss. There is nothing remarkable about a sitting president campaigning for his party in the midterms and trying to bolster incumbents by steering projects and support to their districts. But Trump’s actions constitute a unique attempt to interfere in a critical election before it is even held, raising alarms about the future of democracy. Allan Lichtman, a distinguished history professor at American University in Washington, said: “We’re seeing a new concerted assault on free and fair elections, harkening back to the discredited efforts of the white supremacists in the Jim Crow south. He’s trying to rig the midterms and then of course beyond that the next presidential election in his political favour.” Trump previously attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which culminated in an insurrection by his supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. On that occasion, he was constrained by elected Republicans such as his then vice-president, Mike Pence, and the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. This time he has locked down near-total loyalty from the party and assembled a cabinet that again this week offered an ostentatious display of fealty. His power grab will not go entirely unchallenged. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, signed legislation that will allow voters to decide in November on a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more House seats next year, neutralising Republicans’ gerrymandering in Texas. But Democrats, activists and lawyers will have to find others ways to “fight fire with fire” when it comes to Trump’s more extreme meddling. Lichtman, author of a new book, Conservative at the Core, added: “Republicans have no principles; Democrats have no spine. Democrats need to grow a spine. They need to stop playing not to lose – that’s a sure way to lose. They need to respond to these outrages powerfully and aggressively by whatever means are possible or we’re going to lose our democracy.” Yet while Trump’s gambit is a flex of executive power, it could also be seen as an admission of potential weakness. The incumbent president’s party typically loses seats in midterm elections. In 2018, Democrats won enough to take back the House, stymieing Trump’s agenda and leading to his impeachment. Only 37% of voters approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released on Wednesday, while 55% disapprove. House Republicans, who currently have just a three-seat margin, have faced a series of raucous town halls that bode ill for their fortunes. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “President Trump and the Republicans would not be trying to stack the deck if they didn’t think they were going to lose the hand. They are looking at poll numbers and they know midterms are bad to incumbent presidents over the last 60 years and it’s a very slim margin in the House. “In order for Trump to sustain the loyalty of the House – he’s already gotten everything he pretty much wants – he needs them to think he’s on their side so he’s going to go out and be very public about rigging the voting system to keep them in power.” But Schiller added: “Will that be enough to overcome general unhappiness at the moment that the voters seem to have with the economy, inflation, even Trump’s border policies? It’s not enough to keep the Republicans in line. You have to get independent voters to vote for you again and that’s at risk for the Republicans right now.”

13) Has Trump succeeded in normalising American autocracy? — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     When it comes to the rise of autocracy in America, Justice Potter Stewart’s famous pronouncement on pornography might be particularly appropriate at the moment: “I know it when I see it.” The cult of personality was apparent as Donald Trump’s cabinet convened on Wednesday in a marathon session that could have embarrassed even a seasoned strongman, providing for three hours and 17 minutes of fawning television coverage. There was Steve Witkoff, the president’s top envoy and negotiator, standing up in the increasingly gilded Cabinet Room, offering praise that could have made even Vladimir Putin blush. “There’s only one thing I wish for – that the Nobel committee finally gets its act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since this Nobel award was ever talked about,” he said to applause from secretaries of state, defense and other top cabinet officials. Or was it Stephen Miller on Fox News in effect criminalising the opposition to Trump and calling Chicago a “killing field” despite controverting facts. “The Democrat party is not a political party, it is a domestic extremist organisation,” he said in a strident tone, claiming that the party was devoted “exclusively to the defence of hardened criminals, gangbangers and illegal alien killers and terrorists”. Was it the president calling, on social media, for the arrest of a wealthy financier and his son for their support for civil society? “George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States of America,” he wrote on Truth Social. Or perhaps it was the revocation of Secret Service protection for his electoral rival Kamala Harris, or the FBI raid on the home of John Bolton, his former national security adviser, who has become an outspoken critic of the president’s national security agenda. Or was it in the commonplace nature of a raid outside an elementary school in Mt Pleasant in Washington DC, where police staked out a school with a large Spanish-speaking population in what became just another immigration raid in America. Some activists and observers have sounded the alarm: authoritarianism of the kind that Americans are used to condemning abroad has become increasingly normal in the United States. Don Moynihan, a political scientist and professor at the University of Michigan, wrote this week that “today, America is a competitive authoritarian system, with a rapidly increasing emphasis on the authoritarian part.” The checklist to consolidate power, he wrote, includes efforts to control the government bureaucracy, the military, internal security, the legal system, civil society, higher education, the media and elections. The pursuit of those aims had been “systematic”, he wrote. Abdelrahman ElGendy has watched this process with a feeling of grim recognition. ElGendy spent six years in prison in his native Egypt on political charges, but fled to the US in order to work on a memoir he is set to release next year. In April, however, he packed his things and left the US following the detention of the Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil. ElGendy’s lawyers warned him that he could face a similar fate after his personal details were posted on a website used to target opponents of Israel’s war in Gaza. Since then, he has watched from abroad as the situation has worsened. “I haven’t second-guessed leaving the US. In fact I feel very grateful that I made the choice that I did before things got even worse,” he said. “I left Egypt to escape political persecution … The reason I left the US is because I started to recognize those same patterns forming around me. And since leaving it’s only gone downhill.” When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) began carrying out large-scale raids and he was identified online as a potential target, he said he found himself once again waiting to be taken away at any moment. “I don’t think political incarceration is the most important characteristic of authoritarianism, it’s more the constant threat of it that matters most,” he said. “What really sustains authoritarianism is that quiet knowledge that the prison door is always within reach … that shadow is what shapes behavior.” From Russia to Turkey, and Hungary to El Salvador, activists, observers and political scientists have watched the quick consolidation of power by the Trump administration as it has followed a familiar pattern of autocratic rollout. Washington has found common cause with some of the world’s harshest authoritarian regimes such Russia and El Salvador. This week, the US deported nearly 50 Russians, according to activists, including some who probably requested political asylum in the United States. Hundreds of migrants and even citizens have been deported to prisons in El Salvador. “Sometimes I almost feel it’s like ‘I told you so,’” said Noah Bullock, the chief executive of Cristosal, a leading human rights group in El Salvador which was forced to leave the country last month after 25 years of documenting abuses of power. “With the Ice crackdown and the creation of this massive law enforcement agency that only obeys the president – there are no good historical references where that works out well.” “One of the things that I see happening that hits me really close is when these security or police forces begin to look at the whole population as enemies,” he added, comparing it to El Salvador where they had been “trained to see the population as a threat”. The winner-take-all dynamics of the Trump administration, which has claimed a historic mandate despite winning among the thinnest majorities in a generation, have made this a particularly fraught moment. Along with the federal takeover of police forces, the other commonly cited danger is the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas and resulting fightback in California, as well as other efforts to diminish voter turnout ahead of the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections. Some activists insist it is not too late to turn back. Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, and Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, wrote this week that “We Can Stop the Rise of American Autocracy”. Citing Hungary and Venezuela as examples, they wrote that “we cannot be lulled into believing that this is like anything we’ve seen before and can therefore be solved by simply waiting for the midterm elections. The antidote to Trump’s American breed of autocracy is understanding the severity of the threat at hand.” But others see the trend toward authoritarianism as merely an acceleration of the direction of US politics even before Trump. “That assumes that the United States was a functioning healthy democracy that slipped … and that’s just not the case in my opinion,” said ElGendy. “When a democracy is designed with this capacity for authoritarianism you’re never more than one election away from its reappearance. That’s not an accident, that’s a design flaw.”

     Extreme politics and extreme weather go hand in hand, and both have to be confronted if we are to understand and overcome the polycrisis we are living through. Yet few media organisations are examining why the climate emergency is creating a new era of demagogues. Even fewer are scrutinising how those authoritarian leaders are trying to misdirect public attention away from the root cause of our current global malaise. The Guardian is different. About nine out of every 10 people in the world want their governments to take stronger climate actions, yet we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift away from the progress we need to avert climate disaster. Powerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises and some are funding secretive lobby groups and far-right politicians that want to shift away from the progress we need to make real, positive change. The pushback has been shocking. Debunking climate disinformation is a full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly in the United States, now that the world’s biggest fossil fuel producer appears intent on undermining hard-won progress on reducing emissions. The most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the US National Weather Service, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while the devastation in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding. Then there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain. Most alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and supported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and prepare their doomsday bunkers. There also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible. The Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain. Worse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead to a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change. The Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both. Earlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartland has been wooing far-right European politicians since at least February 2023. In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian’s earlier Polluters series to name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions, and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action. We are not alone. This is not a fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell us.

15) Trump to order voter ID for every vote, ‘no exceptions’ — Al Jazeera (2025-08-31)

     US president is seeking to overhaul country’s electoral system, falsely claiming his 2020 loss was a result of fraud.
     United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order requiring voter identification from every voter.
     “Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.
     “Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military,” he added.
     The announcement comes as Trump seeks to overhaul the electoral system in the US over false claims that his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud.
     The president and his Republican allies also have made baseless claims about widespread voting by non-citizens, which is illegal and rarely occurs.
     For years, he has called for the end of electronic voting machines, pushing instead for the use of paper ballots and hand counts, a process that election officials say is time-consuming, costly and far less accurate than machine counting.
     In March this year, Trump signed a sweeping executive order that included requirements for documentary proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections and for all ballots to be received by Election Day.
     A judge in April blocked parts of that order, including the proof-of-citizenship requirement, saying that the US Constitution gives the power to regulate federal elections to states and Congress – not the president.
     Trump, meanwhile, pledged to also issue an executive order to end the use of mail-in ballots and voting machines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
     The November 3, 2026, elections will be the first nationwide referendum on Trump’s domestic and foreign policies since he returned to power in January. Democrats will be seeking to break the Republicans’ grip on both the House of Representatives and the Senate to block Trump’s domestic agenda.

16) Pep Guardiola confident of good season for Manchester City after seeing improvement — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Pep Guardiola says he can sense that Manchester City will have a good year after seeing a marked improvement in the squad, starting from the Club World Cup, but wants to see consistency from the team. After thrashing Wolves at Molineux on the opening weekend, a home defeat by Tottenham brought them back down to earth for a mixed start to the campaign. City will be aiming to get over that loss at Brighton on Sunday in the final match before the international break. The two-week gap will deny them the chance to build momentum for now but when they return to action against Manchester United, it will initiate the start of a hectic domestic and European schedule. Asked why he was feeling confident, the City head coach said: “The way we are training and the way we are competing. We have to improve, but there are things that I would say are a sign. When I see these things in games, like in the United States of America, I like it. We won six Premier Leagues in eight years and when we started the season I wouldn’t say I knew we were going to win the league. But I see things that I like. “Even against Spurs I saw many things that I like my teams to do. I want to do some of them much, much better, but that is completely normal at this stage of the season. You will see through the results. When you are able to win four, five or six games in a row, or you’re competing well, or being stable in many departments, conceding few and scoring much more. After that I will say: ‘Our consistency is back.’” The first stage of the Champions League will begin after the Manchester derby with the visit of Napoli on Thursday 18 September and the prospect of playing twice almost every week until the end of January will give the opportunity to build up rhythm. Five players have arrived since the end of last season, three making debuts at the Club World Cup, but Guardiola is waiting for them to integrate fully into a team that have adjusted their style since finishing a distant third in the Premier League and trophyless overall. “Maybe in two months I will say how wrong I was, but right now I have seen, since we travelled to the States for the World Cup, I have seen things that I like,” Guardiola said.

17) More than 500 workers at Voice of America and other broadcasters to be laid off — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters is eliminating jobs for more than 500 employees, a Trump administration official said. The move could ratchet up a months-long legal challenge over the news outlets’ fate. Kari Lake, acting CEO of the US Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director. US district judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA’s operations. His order Monday gave the administration “one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial” to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by 15 September. On Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be “plainly contrary to law”, according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Ronald Reagan. Lake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency “will continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF– and will likely improve its ability to function”. “I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America’s voice is heard abroad where it matters most,” she wrote. A group of agency employees who sued to block VOA’s elimination said Lake’s move would give their colleagues 30 days until their pay and benefits end. “We find Lake’s continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,” they said in a statement. “We are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any evidence of that.” They added: “We will continue to fight for what we believe to be our rights under the law.” In June, layoff notices were sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective 31 August. The administration said in a court filing Thursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 “active employees” and 62 other employees on administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others on administrative leave. The agency also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Martí, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the cold war and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend US influence and combat authoritarianism. In March, Abramowitz warned that Trump’s attempts to dismantle the VOA would be a “self-inflicted blow” to American national security, saying: “If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they’re going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can’t be good for America … They’re going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.” He added: “The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. … So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.” This week, Trump also moved to remove union protections from a handful of federal employees, including those from the VOA. In response, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the nation’s largest trade union of public employees, said: “AFSCME members who fulfill the Congressionally mandated mission to broadcast Voice of America around the globe shine the beacon of freedom on the most oppressive of regimes. Now, because they have been fighting to keep Voice of America’s mission alive, their own voice on the job has been stripped from them. AFSCME will fight this illegal action in court.” Earlier this year, foreign staff at US-backed media outlets voiced concerns over their safety following Trump’s shuttering of the global media agencies. Speaking to the Guardian in March, Jaewoo Park, a journalist for Radio Free Asia, said: “We have many co-workers in different services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to their own country, their lives would be at risk.” “Authoritarian governments have praised what Trump is doing right now … In Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they came to work at RFA. It’s very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if Radio Free Asia doesn’t exist,” he added.

18) Elizabeth Terland fires Manchester United a step closer to Women’s Champions League — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Maya Le Tissier praised her teammates for “fighting for the badge” after Manchester United moved a step closer to reaching the Women’s Champions League by edging past Hammarby in Stockholm in a nervy second qualifying round tie. Elisabeth Terland’s fourth goal in two games was enough to see United progress, as she continued her good form after scoring a hat-trick in their previous qualifying fixture on Wednesday, a 4-0 win over PSV. Saturday’s tie was a far less one-sided affair, though, as the Swedish side Hammarby provided a tricky test for United, and Le Tissier, the United captain, knew the visitors’ defensive work had been key. “It was an intense game,” Le Tissier told MUTV. “They [Hammarby] are really, really physical, good on the break and good on the counter. Their speciality is crosses and they were really good at that, but we defended really well. Everyone got together and it was a proper team effort to stay connected. [We] fought for the badge and fought for the win. We were solid today. I’m really proud of the players.” Manchester United have never played in the main draw of the Women’s Champions League and are now just a two-legged knockout tie away from doing so, after Saturday’s crucial win. Terland found the breakthrough in the 61st minute after Celin Bizet’s right-ring cross was cleverly flicked back across the penalty area by Melvine Malard to Terland, who squeezed the ball into the net at the near post. The cross and then the assist from Malard were two much-needed moments of quality in a game that had been closely fought and lacking in decisiveness in either penalty area. As a result of the goal Marc Skinner’s side have beaten the hosts of this mini-tournament of four teams – which had the rather long-winded name of second qualifying round league path group one – played at the Swedish side’s 3Arena venue. Hammarby were backed by more than 5,000 noisy supporters but Skinner’s team were undeterred by that disadvantage and stayed patient as they searched for their breakthrough. It was not the most inspiring of performances from United and they will need to improve if they are to progress through the third qualifying round and join Chelsea and the defending champions, Arsenal, in the new league phase. United should have opened the scoring earlier. In the third minute, Ella Toone had cut the ball back into Terland’s path inside the area but her shot was saved. Anna Sandberg also went close 15 minutes later when she rifled a left-foot strike just over the bar. Five minutes into the second half, Bizet broke through but could not beat the goalkeeper and Malard rushed a half-volleyed effort on the rebound. However, Hammarby had come closest to scoring in the first half when, 28 minutes in, Sofia Reidy struck the bar from inside the area after the ball fell kindly to her. Once they had got their noses in front, United managed the game well and calmly saw out the victory. They will learn their third qualifying round opponents in Sunday’s draw, possibly a big name such as Real Madrid or Roma. The Manchester United winger Bizet added to MUTV: “It was not an easy game. Hammarby are physical, fast and they know what they’re doing out there. They have a back five with a lot of rotation. It was a tough game but I felt we had control in the last 30 minutes. Win 1-0, it’s all we need. “It’s been a long summer, with the Euros, and we have some injuries now, a few, so we are just working proper hard. It’s been four days now with two games and not many subs, so we’re tired but we work hard, so give the credit to the girls and the staff.” United will be in action again next Sunday, when they begin their Women’s Super League campaign at home to currently managerless Leicester.

     Ross Heppenstall was at Elland Road. Here’s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM. Daniel Farke’s turn to speak to Sky. “I’m a happy man tonight … four points from three matches … a really competitive game … two games here at home, four points, two clean sheets … this is how you need to approach a season as a newly promoted side … difficult to beat … a tight game … we had bigger chances … rock solid … we need to do a bit more in the offence … I’m pretty happy today … we made it difficult for Newcastle … this is a side who plays at Champions League level … I’m pretty happy with the point … happy with the clean sheet … don’t want to be too critical that we didn’t score a goal today … we are happy with the start but we don’t lean back, we keep the foot on the gas … keep going.” As for the last couple of days of the transfer frenzy … “We would need to add some more quality up front … be good to have some options … we need to stay awake until the last hour of this window.” Leeds midfielder Sean Longstaff, who spent 18 years at his boyhood club Newcastle, talks to Sky. “It was a bit strange … I thoroughly enjoyed it … some of my best friends are in that dressing room … so I didn’t speak to them for a few days, which was really weird! … thoroughly enjoyed the game … it was competitive … I loved it … Newcastle have some of the best travelling fans in the world … but I’m lucky enough to join a club whose fans are just as good, if not better! … both really passionate fanbases and it’s a pleasure to play in front of both of them … it was really tough [to leave Newcastle] … when you look at it without emotion involved, this move was a really good one for me … it’s a massive football club … a big project … we know it will be tough to stay in the league but we have signed well … leaving Newcastle for the very first time was really sad … lots of tears from both sides … getting on for 27 you want to play as many games as possible and for me, I thought this was the best place to do it … [the start of the season] has been very positive.” Sky then offer Howe the chance to wax lyrical over Newcastle’s new signing Nick Woltemade. “He’s a really good technician … his size will be a talking point because he’s obviously a big presence … but he’s not really a target man … although he can head the ball … it’s his creativity around the box … his link play … dribbles really well for someone so big … real creativity … he will find passes not many others can see … he will add a dimension we currently don’t have … generally that will lift confidence … you have to have lots of strings to your bow to be successful in England, and he has them.” As for what’s left of the transfer window … “Not sure … there are no guarantees … we will keep working … genuinely we’re a lot stronger squad-wise than we were last year … fingers crossed we might do some more” What next for Isak? “I don’t know … I’m not party to any talks going on … I will find out like everybody else.” Regarding the imminent closure of the transfer window, Howe adds: “That will be huge for us … we are looking forward to that clarity … what our squad looks like … the noise around us can’t have been easy for the players … once we have clarity, we move forward and I’m sure we can do really well this year … long term the team looks pretty good.” Eddie Howe, drenched to the skin with West Yorkshire rain, speaks to Sky Sports. “Defensively we were very strong … really good in the three games so far in that respect … we’ve got work to do at the other end of the pitch … it’s really unlike us … historically free-scoring … good chance creation … today it wasn’t there … we have to do better with what we have … but when you lose the quality of player we have … Anthony Gordon, Joelinton, of course Alex [Isak] … take those three away and you are going to suffer slightly … we need to do better.” The xG of that match was 0.59-0.42. The lowest of any game so far this season, and even that sounds generous. … so this is how the Premier League looks after today’s round of matches. Leeds will be perfectly content with their haul of four points from their first three games; that’s two more than Newcastle, whose slow start continues. You could make an argument for Newcastle deserving to win the matches against Aston Villa and Liverpool; they didn’t do so well tonight, though, well snuffed out as they were by Leeds, for whom Dominic Calvert-Lewin buzzed around infectiously on his league debut for the club. It wasn’t a classic, and a draw seems a fair result. Newly promoted Leeds will be the happier with their point; their fans certainly sound pleased enough. Both clubs now switch their attention to the final two days of the transfer window. 90 min +5: On Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher names Sean Longstaff as his player of the match. 90 min +4: Now it’s Osula’s turn to disappoint from the wing. He shanks into the stand from a promising position on the right. 90 min +3: Harrison sneaks past Livramento on the left. He should probably do more than just win a corner, but can’t tee up anyone in the middle. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece, which Pope claims without fuss. 90 min +2: Newcastle press Leeds back awhile, but Calvert-Lewin snaffles the ball and powers upfield, laying off to Harrison who buys a cheap free kick to release the pressure. Calvert-Lewin has been very impressive. 90 min +1: The first of six additional minutes. 90 min: From the resulting throw, Bogle jinks his way down the right and stands one up in the middle, but Pope is onto him and claims before anyone in white can bundle home. 89 min: Calvert-Lewin has looked sharp and purposeful since coming on, putting himself about to some effect. Now he gets a stride ahead of Burn down the right, and fizzes a low drive towards the bottom-right corner. Pope sticks out a strong leg to hack clear. That was heading in. 88 min: Osula clumsily clanks Stach to the ground. A pointless challenge, because Newcastle were preparing to launch a counter attack. Guimaraes isn’t happy, and moans at the referee, which feels a little bit like displacement 101. 86 min: Bogle crosses from the right, looking for Calvert-Lewin, who prepares to direct a header goalwards from the penalty spot. But Schar is on point and heads behind for a corner instead. A necessary last-ditch challenge … and the resulting corner is a waste of everyone’s time. 85 min: Newcastle appear a little more eager to chase a winner, but Leeds are holding firm and there’s not a great deal happening. Speaking of which … “I’m not saying the game was wildly interesting before Jacob Murphy left the field of play,” begins Kári Tulinius, “but since his substitution, Newcastle’s attacks have been as forgettable as their away kit. Leeds have yet to do anything of note. Murphy might as well have gone home with the ball.” 83 min: Harrison scoops another pass along the inside-left channel. This one’s intended for Aaronson, in a pocket of space, but it’s way too strongly hit and sails through to the keeper. 82 min: Newcastle ping it around to little effect. “Harvey Barnes had scored a goal in five of his six Premier League games against Leeds before tonight,” writes Michael Jenkins. “As a Leeds fan I wasn’t unhappy that Howe decided to start Osula and Murphy ahead of Barnes. Not crazy about him coming on late with the score at 0-0 though.” 80 min: Gudmundsson picks up a knock and is replaced by Justin, freshly signed from Leicester City. 78 min: Guimaraes and Elanga nearly open Leeds up with a middle-distance one-two down the right. Nearly, but Elanga’s pass back is inches off target as Guimaraes enters the box. Had that found its target, Gumnaraes was in space, and one on one with Perri. 76 min: Livramento throws long from the right. Burn’s the target, but the throw doesn’t beat the first man. Leeds dealing with these long hurls rather better than Liverpool did on Monday night. 74 min: Calvert-Lewin, his tail up, now bashes a long-distance shot wide right. 73 min: Harrison intercepts a loose Tonali pass and strides down the left. Newcastle are light at the back. Harrison loops a pass down the channel for Calvert-Lewin, who strides ahead of Schar and tries to bring the ball down with a telescopic leg. He half-controls, but the heavy touch goes through to Pope. So nearly a fine combination between the former Everton duo. 71 min: Newcastle go up the other end and Hall sends a rising screamer over the bar. That wasn’t too far away from the top-left corner, and it’s not certain that Perri was getting there. 70 min: Space momentarily opens up for Gudmundsson down the left. He attempts to cross but Elanga blocks out for a corner. Before it can be taken, Calvert-Lewin comes on for his Premier League debut for Leeds, replacing Nmecha. Then the corner’s taken, and Pope claims it easily enough. 69 min: Scrub that. Botman is replaced anyway, sacrificed for Barnes as Newcastle go from five at the back to four. Botman trudges off under his own steam. 68 min: Botman, who has had his problems with injury, is thankfully good to continue. 67 min: Botman lands awkwardly after an aerial battle with Nmecha. On comes the trainer. 66 min: For a second, it looks as though Osula’s about to tear clear of Struijk … but he’s shoved the defender in the back with both hands. Nope! 65 min: Stach has the chance to release Aaronson into acres down the right, but seriously overhits the pass. Aaronson tries his best to athletically bring the ball under control anyway, but he can’t do so and the opportunity goes by. A smattering of irritated jabbering from the home fans. 63 min: Elanga crosses low from the right. Osula goes over in the vague environs of Rodon, but it’s not a penalty. “Watching Tino Livramento constantly ignore Dan Burn’s overlapping runs is borderline life affirming watching this at 4am,” writes Australia’s number-one Toon fan Chris Paraskevas. “Same goes for every corner that doesn’t clear the first man. We are the worst set piece team in the country.” 62 min: Newcastle make a couple of positive changes of their own, replacing Trippier with Hall and Murphy with Elanga. 60 min: Nmecha’s sheer presence down the right forces Botman into the concession of a corner … which is easily plucked from the sky by Pope. This match has not been an attacking masterclass. 59 min: Trippier sends it in. Guimaraes clatters into the nearest Leeds defender and that’s the free kick wasted. Leeds then make their first changes, sending on Aaronson and Harrison for James and Gnonto. 58 min: Livramento is flipped into the air by Bogle. Free kick, out on the Newcastle left. Trippier prepares to swing it into a packed Leeds box. 57 min: Trippier sends a not particularly good cross in from the right. Struijk considers heading behind for a corner, then pulls out, surprising Perri behind him. The keeper does well to make a reaction stop in double-quick time. Leeds finally clear their lines. Fiasco avoided in the nick of time. 55 min: … is headed clear powerfully by Nmecha. 54 min: This is better, though, as Murphy skips in from the right and buys a ticket for the raffle. He pearls a low swerving shot towards the bottom left, forcing Perri to turn the ball around the post. Fine play all round. Then the resulting corner … 53 min: Tonali and Schar take turns to consider shooting from distance. Neither do. Then Miley slices a simple right-wing cross into the stand behind the goal. It’s all a bit like that at the moment. 51 min: Gnonto scampers down the left and rolls across the face of the Newcastle box for Bogle, who is given a little too much time to line up his shot. Thankfully for Newcastle, Bogle is swinging with his weaker peg and sends the ball sailing high and wide. 49 min: Trippier goes lunging after a loose ball, and catches Nmecha. It’s clumsy rather than naughty, but it’ll hurt all the same. Nmecha gets up again soon enough. The referee not minded to flash yellow if he can avoid doing so, as the Longstaff-Ramsey challenge has already illustrated. 47 min: Newcastle kicked off in the PSG style, incidentally, punting long towards the corner flag. Get hip to the new craze, daddio. Newcastle get the second half started. They’ve been forced into a change: Ramsey is still apparently feeling the effects of that Longstaff challenge on 21 mins, and has been replaced by Miley. Speaking of strikers and transfers … here’s a bit of breaking news to while away the half-time break. Half-chances for both sides, but no cutting edge for either. Just a couple of days until the transfer window shuts. 45 min +2: Nothing much happens in the first two, so let’s hear from Toon fan Chris Paraskevas: “With the amount of delicious 90s-era whipped crosses going in - and Osula doing his best Mark Viduka At Newcastle impersonation, one second behind play every time the ball is delivered - I reckon just chuck Nick Pope up top and let’s see how bad his first touch really is.” 45 min: Newcastle are finishing the half strongly. Schar has a go from the right flank this time, but his long-range whip is always sailing high and wide. There will be four additional first-half minutes. 43 min: Murphy drifts in from the right and has a shot. Blocked. Corner. The set piece is worked long, and Schar, to the left of the D, nearly nets with a looping, dipping, speculative shot that almost drifts into the top-right corner. Had it been on target, Perri was beaten. But it deflects out for another corner, from which nothing comes. 41 min: Newcastle get patient, painting some triangles up and down the right channel, before suddenly pinging Ramsey into space on the flank. Ramsey looks long for Murphy, who can’t Van Basten a volley from an extremely tight angle on the left. Goal kick. 39 min: … nothing occurs. Newcastle attempt to counter but Gnonto stops Osula mid-gallop, and goes into the book. 38 min: Gnonto dribbles in from the left and takes a whack from the edge of the box. The shot deflects off Schar and out for a corner. From which … 36 min: Pope races from his box to clear the ball out for a throw, then deliberately gets in the way of James, stopping the Leeds man taking a quick one, and allowing him to get back into position. Into the book he goes. 35 min: Gudmundsson is sent into space down the left. He sends a dangerous diagonal ball through the six-yard box. Pope is out of position, but James and Bogle get in each other’s way at the far stick. Goal kick. Leeds are making awfully hard work of getting a shot away. 33 min: Gnonto cuts in from the left and has a chance to shoot, but opts against it, before losing possession. Longstaff wins the ball back just outside the Newcastle box, and tees up Stach, who curls well wide of the left-hand post. 31 min: Bogle romps down the middle and has the opportunity to release Gnonto into the box down the left. But he hangs onto the ball too long, and is eventually dispossessed by Tonali. Had he pinged Gnonto into space, the winger had just one man to beat, with other options in the middle. 29 min: Both teams suffering a bit from a lack of cutting edge up front. Like that’s breaking news. Penny for the thoughts of Newcastle’s new signing Nick Woltemade, who is watching in the stands. 27 min: James tries to release Nmecha down the middle. Nmecha can’t get the ball under control, and falls over in the environs of Botman. The crowd cry for a penalty, but the players don’t bother. 26 min: Livramento nips down the left touchline with dainty feet, and should pull back upon reaching the byline, but takes one touch too many and is ushered out of play by Bogle. 25 min: Murphy crosses low from the right but can’t find Osula in the middle. Both teams are nearly getting there. Meanwhile here’s more from James Humphries, who is definitely still not drinking on the train, officer: “To be fair, one of football’s little joys is watching a ref/assistant trying not to look like they’re dying inside as they stand on a touchline getting mocked by thousands, having their bum-bag battery adjusted and fiddling with their ear like they’re wondering if that second pass with the cotton bud was a terrible error. (I’d say ‘who’d be a ref, eh’ to close the circle but no, not quite able to take the broad view yet.)” 23 min: … nothing occurs, as Newcastle pull it back for Trippier, whose delivery from deep is no good. Leeds counter through Gnonto down the right. Gnonto crosses low, but Nmecha can’t quite extend his toes far enough to poke home at the near post. Pope gathers. 22 min: Guimaraes drops deep and nearly releases Osula down the middle with a raking ball. A little bit too much power on the pass. But Newcastle come again, through Murphy, who wins a corner down the right. From which … 21 min: … and it stops again as Ramsey gets a spot of treatment, having been caught from behind by an over-eager Longstaff. That could have been a booking. Thankfully Ramsey is good to continue, and so, having stopped again, we start again. Again. 19 min: James cuts in from the right and curls a dangerous-looking low cross into the Newcastle box. Botman dives to clear with a brilliant defensive header. Had he not intervened, Gnonto was meeting that cross, six yards out. A good game now, if a bit stop-and-start. 18 min: The rain continues to tip down. Summer’s gone, kids. Calling captain autumn. 16 min: Ramsey scampers down the left and fires a low ball into the box for Osula, who spins on the spot and fires a drive towards the bottom right. Gudmundsson makes a brave block. That was heading in otherwise. Leeds hack the ball behind, then deal with the resulting corner. So close to the opener. 14 min: The assistant has sourced some new batteries for his earpiece and the game can restart. Is the simple act of shouting at each other not the done thing any more? 12 min: Play is temporarily suspended because one of the referee’s assistants is having trouble with his headset. Good grief. 10 min: Murphy dribbles down the inside-right channel but eventually loses the ball, then gives Osula the what-for, presumably for not making a run and thus failing to give him an option to pass. 8 min: James dribbles in from the right and is caught from behind by Livramento, who is certainly putting himself about during these early exchanges. A free kick and so everyone lines up on the edge of the Newcastle box. With everyone expecting Stach to swing the ball in, he tries to catch Pope out with a low drive towards the bottom-right corner. There’s a gap there, but the shot sails harmlessly wide right. Think Gary McAllister in the final minute of the Merseyside derby at Goodison in 2001, only the other way around, and not as successful. 7 min: James combines with Stach as Leeds launch their first sortie down the middle, but Schar gets in the road to close the avenue to goal. 6 min: Other than that one burst from Livramento, this match hasn’t got going yet. Not sure whether James Humphries will care or not: “On my way back to Glasgow having watched Motherwell chuck a lead away again in the comedy/poundshop Pep style (ably assisted by the ref, but it’s a game in the SPFL so of course it was) against a team coached by one of our ex-managers, so I’m in a sufficiently foul mood that my hope for Dirty Leeds vs Dirty Money Newcastle is that they both somehow lose. A guy on the platform was handing out tins, though (which in case any of the transport polis are reading, I am definitely not drinking on the train) so maybe by the time we get home I’ll be wishing goodwill to both these fine historic teams. Maybe. Who’d be a football fan, eh?” 4 min: Livramento wriggles clear of Bogle and Rodon down the left, and into acres of space. He can’t find Murphy in the middle with his low cross, and Leeds get away with a big one. That was a fine run by the England full-back. 2 min: A fairly nondescript start to the game, during which Leeds see plenty of the ball. Elland Road in good voice. Leeds get the ball rolling. The rain tipping down in West Yorkshire. Before kick-off, there’s a moment of applause to remember all the Leeds fans who have passed away during the last 12 months. A beautifully warm ovation. The teams are out! Leeds in white with blue trim that takes us back to the late seventies, Newcastle in third-choice blue that takes us back to the late nineties (19th or 20th century, the choice is yours). We’ll be off after a couple of minutes of this piccolo-infused classic. Daniel Farke talks to Sky and is asked about his two full debutants, Sean Longstaff and Lukas Nmecha. “We have a tough start … away at Arsenal and then you play against Newcastle who were in their last game against 11 men the better side … we know it’s a tough fixture … at Elland Road we always have a chance … we want to use that today … intensity alone won’t be enough … quality on the ball … a good structure off it … Newcastle are one of the most intense sides … one of the toughest tasks … we expect a difficult game … but we will play to our own strengths … for [former Newcastle midfielder Sean Longstaff] it’s a pretty emotional game but also a chance to shine … we need him at his best … [striker Lukas Nmecha’s] physicality against a pretty physical defence is a good choice … hopefully they can both deliver.” Howe also clears up any confusion over today’s selection of Fabian Schär, whose substitution against Liverpool was erroneously reported at the time to be a result of concussion. “No it wasn’t [concussion] … he was actually fine … we made the decision to take him off because we couldn’t risk going down to nine men … there was a little bit of confusion but the doctor followed all the Premier League protocols and he was fine.” Newcastle finally landed a striker this morning, in the shape of 6ft 5in Nick Woltemade, and Eddie Howe is delighted, telling Sky Sports: “He’s got a presence, that’s for sure! … it was great to meet him in person yesterday … what a warm, great guy … friendly … he’s going to add a lot to our changing room … also add a lot on the pitch … real technical skills … hopefully he can score a lot of goals for us … I’ve got no idea on [how this signing affects the Alexander Isak] situation … I’m totally separate from it … I’m working on preparation for today.” Leeds United make two changes to the side that started the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal this time last week. Joël Piroe and Ao Tanaka make way for Sean Longstaff and Lukas Nmecha, both of whom are making their full debuts. Newcastle United make four changes to the XI selected to start that rollercoaster 3-2 loss against Liverpool. Sven Botman, William Osula, Jacob Murphy and full-debutant Jacob Ramsey come in for the injured Joelinton, the suspended Anthony Gordon, and Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga, who both drop to the bench. Sandro Tonali has recovered from the shoulder problem he suffered on Monday evening. Leeds United: Lucas Perri, Bogle, Rodon, Struijk, Gudmundsson, Nmecha, Gruev, Stach, James, Longstaff, Gnonto. Subs: Darlow, Calvert-Lewin, Piroe, Aaronson, Bijol, Okafor, Harrison, Bornauw, Justin. Newcastle United: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Guimaraes, Tonali, Ramsey, Livramento, Osula, Jacob Murphy. Subs: Ramsdale, Hall, Lascelles, Barnes, Thiaw, Krafth, Elanga, Willock, Miley. Referee: Peter Bankes (Merseyside). Both of these teams are hurting right now. And here’s why. An opportunity to salve the sting presents itself at 5.30pm UK time. It’s on!

20) Federal judge allows 9/11 case against Saudi Arabia to proceed to trial — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     A federal judge in New York rejected Saudi Arabia’s latest effort to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges the country supported the 9/11 hijackers, in what family members of victims described as a “powerful step toward justice”. Judge George B Daniels said that the claims in the lawsuit, brought by the families of those murdered, were legally sufficient to proceed to trial. He noted that the employment of an imam and an accountant by Saudi Arabia likely had some connection with the pair’s support of two al-Qaida members who came to the United States in early 2000 to study English and take flight lessons. He said the plaintiffs had provided “reasonable evidence as to the roles” that two Saudi men, Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia allegedly played, Axios reported. The case alleges that Saudi Arabian government agents provided “an essential support network” for the hijackers. In his ruling, Daniels wrote that Bayoumi “seemed to serve as a connecting point between the hijackers and many other people who had provided assistance to the hijackers at one point or another”, the New York Times reported. Lawyers for relatives of 9/11 victims claim that a group of extremist religious leaders in Saudi Arabia aided the 9/11 hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001. Terry Strada, national chair of 9/11 Families United, a group made up of family members of those murdered in the terrorist attacks, said in a statement: “Today’s decision is another powerful step toward justice. For nearly a quarter-century, the 9/11 families have sought accountability for the support and resources that helped make the attacks possible. Judge Daniels’ ruling makes clear that Saudi Arabia cannot escape responsibility through procedural maneuvers. We are prepared to move forward and present the full scope of evidence in court, so that the truth is undeniable and justice is finally delivered.” Strada added: “Justice demands more than promises. It requires transparency from our own government, accountability from those who aided the hijackers, and action from Congress. Our community will not stop until every fact is brought to light and every path to justice is secured.” Last year a video, filmed in 1999, was released showing Bayoumi – identified by the FBI as a Saudi intelligence agent – filming locations in the center of Washington three months before al-Qaida decided to carry out the 9/11 attacks. The video, obtained and published by CBS, includes commentary from Bayoumi about various locations in the city, including the Washington Monument and the entry points and security arrangements of the US Capitol building, and referring at one point to a “plan”.

21) Coco Gauff settles serve and nerves to book Osaka clash in US Open last 16 — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Coco Gauff arrived in New York with more questions than answers after reshuffling her coaching team on the eve of the year’s final grand slam. Her second major at Roland Garros in June had given way to a summer-long revolt of her serve, often marked by spates of double faults and premature exits, including a first-round departure from Wimbledon. She has framed the change as a long-term fix rather than a quick repair, saying she did not want to “waste time playing a way I don’t want to play”. After two tense night sessions to launch her US Open campaign, the 21-year-old American finally looked settled on Saturday morning, advancing to the second week of her home major for the fourth year running with a 6-3, 6-1 dismissal of Poland’s Magdalena Frech. To address her serving woes, Gauff has enlisted Gavin MacMillan, the biomechanics specialist who helped Aryna Sabalenka rein in her serving yips and climb to the world No 1 ranking with three major titles. The first two rounds showed the transition was bumpy for the No 3 seed: a three-set struggle against Ajla Tomljanovic, then tears on court in a fraught win over Donna Vekic. “It’s been an emotional week,” Gauff said. “I think I needed those tough moments to be able to move forward. I was putting so much pressure on myself.” This time there was no unraveling. Under bright sunshine rather than the Ashe floodlights before a robust Labor Day weekend crowd, Gauff struck just four double faults, built a 3-0 lead and, when Frech briefly levelled at 3-all, responded with assurance. Serving at 40-30 in a tense seventh game, she steadied with a 105mph delivery that drew an error, clenched her fist and surged through the rest of the set. The second set was more straightforward. A bruising 20-shot exchange went Gauff’s way to earn the first break, while another break at love followed two games later as Frech’s errors mounted. The Pole, seeded at a major for the first time, could not hurt the American once rallies extended. “She gives you no pace, maybe not too many angles to work with, so you kind of have to create all the opportunity for yourself,” Gauff said afterwards. Her delivery, so fragile in recent months, became a source of confidence. She landed nearly 80% of first serves in the opener and conceded only two points on serve during the second set. Even when a fourth double fault appeared as she tried to close, she brushed away the danger with a crisp volley before sealing victory after 73 minutes with a quiet pump of her left fist. “Today I definitely think was a step in the right direction,” she said. “I’m more proud of the mental effort … remembering the things that we worked on in practice.” The contrast with her opening rounds was stark. Instead of tense body language and second-guessing, she attacked from the baseline and looked to finish points at the net. The serve remains a work in progress, particularly the toss, but the rhythm was smoother and her self-belief clearer. She even suggested Thursday’s tears might have served a purpose: “Maybe it’s not a weakness,” she reflected. “It’s just showing the things that happen in my head … Today I felt a lot lighter going on court.” For Frech, the world No 28, this was still a week of progress. She had never previously reached the US Open’s third round and her win over Peyton Stearns ensured a career-best result here. But against Gauff the gulf in experience told. The American, making her 25th appearance in a grand slam main draw, already owns two major titles – and boasts a 30-1 record at the majors over the past two years against opponents ranked outside the top 20. That precocity places her among rare company. Only Venus Williams has reached more second weeks at grand slams among US women before turning 22. “This is the level I want to play,” Gauff said. “I know the competition gets tougher from here, but if I keep building from today, I like where my game is going.” Gauff now advances to a delicious fourth-round clash on Monday with Naomi Osaka, the two-time US Open champion who beat 15th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the second week of a major for the first time since 2021. It will be their sixth meeting – Gauff leads 3-2 in the head-to-head – and their first in New York since Osaka’s straight-sets win in 2019, when she was world No 1 and Gauff a 15-year-old wildcard. “It would be a cool kind of déjà vu, but hopefully with a different result,” Gauff said. “I remember it was a tough moment because it was such a hyped-up match. Looking back, I put way too much pressure on myself, thinking I had a chance to do something. I probably did, but I felt more expectation than belief.”

Fulham was done over by VAR. Bin it.” Scottish Premiership fixtures Motherwell 0-1 Kilmarnock Livingston 0-0 Hearts James Humphries has messaged in to say: “Big day in north Lanarkshire - Killie come to fir park under our ex-manager* Kettlewell, who quit citing fan abuse. I must confess I never heard anything beyond the usual for managerial abuse, but that is a pretty ridiculous standard to begin with, so it will be... interesting to see what sort of welcome he gets. “Anyway, with the well going pretty, uh, nicely under Askou’s possession-based football, and Kettlewell’s Killie below us only alphabetically, this could be pretty tasty; especially considering Kettlewell is fairly combustible type (I think he had three touchline bans last season, and that was only up to about February). Lots to look forward to then, and we’ll see how cheery I am after we’ve lost to the inevitable injury-time sickener.” Premier League fixtures Chelsea 2-0 Fulham FT Wolves v Everton Tottenham v Bournemouth Manchester United v Burnley Sunderland v Brentford Leeds United v Newcastle (5:30pm) Goals from Joao Pedro and Enzo Fernandez helped Chelsea to a 2-0 win over Fulham at Stamford Bridge.

Is he injured? They need goals.” To be completely honest, my guess is as good as yours! I don’t think he’s injured. At least, nothing has been said about any kind of injury. He should be fully match fit considering he had a full pre-season with RB Leipzig before moving to Manchester. I’d have thought this would have been the perfect game to put him in from the start. Like you say, United need goals! Jørgen Strand Larsen is not in the Wolves squad this afternoon amid rumours of a potential move to Newcastle. The Magpies saw two bids for the striker knocked back before finally signing Nick Woltemade, a move which was confirmed earlier today. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira said yesterday that Strand Larsen was being treated for a minor knock. Andre Onana has been dropped by Ruben Amorim for Manchester United’s match against Burnley this afternoon. The goalkeeper was heavily criticised for his performance against Grimsby on Wednesday. However, Amorim refused to point the blame at him. Sunderland starting lineup: Roefs, Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Mandava, Diarra, Xhaka, Sadiki, Talbi, Mayenda, Le Fee. Brentford starting lineup: Kelleher, Kayode, Collins, Van den Berg, Lewis-Potter, Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Ouattara, Damsgaard, Schade, Thiago. Wolves starting lineup: Sa, Bueno, Agbadou, Gomes, Tchatchoua, Andre, Gomes, Bueno, Munetsi, Hwang, Arias.

Burnley starting lineup: Dubravka, Walker, Ekdal, Esteve, Hartman, Ugochukwu, Cullen, Bruun Larsen, Mejbri, Anthony, Foster. Hello, good afternoon and welcome to another Clockwatch. We have four Premier League fixtures to look forward to this afternoon, with the likes of Manchester United and Tottenham in action. Following their shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town midweek, United host Burnley at Old Trafford in what could be viewed by some as a must-win game. Speaking of Grimsby, they face Bristol Rovers in League Two at the same time. Meanwhile, Tottenham welcome Bournemouth to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as they look to continue their perfect start to the campaign. Elsewhere, Wolves - who are yet to win a Premier League match this season - take on Everton and Sunderland host Brentford. I’ll also bring you updates from across the EFL as the 3pm BST matches get under way.

23) Manchester United squeeze past Burnley with controversial Fernandes penalty — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/30/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report
   Text:
     It is easy to see why Ruben Amorim has developed a love-hate relationship with his players after a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty controversially earned Manchester United’s first win of the season. The result should not have been in doubt but poor finishing and defending meant the hosts had to rely on the referee, Sam Barrott, to visit the pitchside monitor and overturn his own decision. Josh Cullen’s own goal gave United a deserved lead they should have built on but Lyle Foster and Jaidon Anthony were twice allowed to equalise either side of Bryan Mbeumo scoring United’s second in 11 chaotic second-half minutes. The match was heading for a draw until it was belatedly judged that Anthony had pulled down Amad Diallo and the United captain did the rest to send Old Trafford wild, while Burnley fumed. But once again, as at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Amorim did not watch the penalty. Things should have been far easier for United. There was an early intensity here as the supporters inspired the players and vice versa. The aggression on and off the field was designed to intimidate Burnley, and it had the potential to work. United had all the possession in the initial stages and looked sharper in mind and foot than at Grimsby as they attempted to play through the visitors, creating numerous half chances without testing the goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. The former Manchester City captain Kyle Walker was the most unpopular man in the stadium. He was booed when his name was read out and every time he touched the ball. He tried to curry favour when a desperately poor clearance was blocked by Mason Mount, who collected the ball and drove towards the box, with Walker pulling at him. A foul was committed and looked like the only debate was whether the indiscretion happened inside or outside of the box. Barrott decided it was a penalty but the video assistant referee sent him to review the footage on the monitor and minutes after the original decision, the referee joined Walker in the bad books when he changed his call. If there were any fears of a divide at United, injustice is a good tool to unify everyone. Technology worked in their favour when the referee’s watch bleeped to say the ball had crossed the line after Casemiro’s header had struck the bar and bounced in off Cullen’s back before Dubravka could act. Even if the manner was fortuitous, the goal was thoroughly merited. Knowing how to control a game when ahead is an art they are yet to master, as the draw at Fulham showed. Burnley also realised they needed to move from a passive to progressive mindset and push forward. Hannibal Mejbri could have marked his return to Old Trafford with a goal but fired over from 10 yards. United resettled after Matheus Cunha was forced off injured and replaced by Joshua Zirkzee. A second goal should have arrived from a dynamic break in first-half stoppage time but Amad fluffed his lines from close range. After 55 minutes of positivity and with the thought of long-term optimism starting to creep in, it was flushed away when Jacob Bruun Larsen swung in a perfect cross for the unmarked Lyle Foster to jab home from close range to begin a manic period of the match. With Old Trafford stunned into silence, the mindset was that of fearing the worst. Direct play changed that when Diogo Dalot reached Zirkzee’s flick and pulled the ball back into Mbeumo’s path for his first home goal as a United player, home fans rediscovering their voices 90 seconds after going mute. Structure had been forgotten, producing a riotous tempo. While the celebrations for United’s second died down, Foster had a goal ruled out for offside but the hosts were fragile. Once again, a set piece in front of the Stretford End was United’s undoing. They failed to clear the ball, allowing Loum Tchaouna to fire a shot which Altay Bayindir parried straight to Anthony, who bundled home a third goal in nine minutes to conclude the immediate chaos – but there was more to come. Fitting with the helter-skelter nature of the game, Barrott gave nothing after Amad ended up on the turf inside the box. He ran to the referee, who eventually went to review the incident and decided Anthony had held on too long. Burnley were incensed but Fernandes shut out the noise before creating euphoria, as troubles are briefly forgotten and pressure is relieved until the Manchester derby in two weeks.

24) Vineyards assess damage as wildfire rips through California wine country: ‘a devastating situation’ — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Elton Slone and his colleagues at the Robert Craig Winery in Napa valley had gathered for their annual pre-harvest company party last week – complete with copper pot carnitas and grape tacos – when one of his co-workers noticed an alert on her phone. The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles (16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on Howell Mountain. Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blaze that damaged numerous wineries and spoiled a year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property to control the larger fire. Vineyards can make excellent fire breaks because they are typically clear of burnable plant matter, and grape vines themselves are moist enough to be nonflammable. But heat damage and smoke can still destroy a crop. The Robert Craig Winery lost the entire crop of their Candlestick Vineyard, which would have generated $4.5m in revenue. Slone estimates about 10% of the vines will need to be replanted – a process that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take a decade to see new bottles of wine ready for market. The team will test grapes on another one of their vineyards closer to harvest to see whether the smoke affected them. The loss comes at the end of the growing season – after Slone’s vineyard had sunk nearly $1m into farming costs – and is made even more devastating because it’s happened before. The memories of the 2020 Glass fire and 2018 Camp fire, which burned farther east but still sent smoke to blanket Napa’s grapevines, are still fresh. “It’s financially a devastating situation,” said Slone. The still-burning Pickett fire, which began on 21 August in northern Napa county, quickly burned through 6,800 acres (2,750 hectares), making it the San Francisco Bay Area’s largest wildfire this year. Preliminary estimates show that it caused $65m in agricultural losses, largely to wine grape growers, affecting about 1,500 acres (610 hectares) of agricultural land. Although that damage is significantly less than that wrought by the Glass fire – which burned through 67,000 acres (27,000 hectares) and racked up $3.7bn in losses – the growing threat of wildfires in arid California has still shaken the wine industry. “Northern California wine country is one of the treasures of the United States,” said Slone. “It’s something that I think all Americans should be concerned about because it’s a uniquely American thing.” ‘Tastes like a campfire’ Along the west coast, wine grape growers have implemented many strategies to prepare for wildfires – with the support of scientists at the US Department of Agriculture and local universities. Ben Montpetit, chair of the University of California, Davis’s viticulture and enology department, said in an emailed statement that the industry has employed “barrier sprays to reduce smoke uptake, annual testing to establish baseline smoke marker levels in grapes, and small-lot fermentations after smoke events to assess potential wine impact”. “Researchers are also investigating which grape cultivars are more sensitive or tolerant to smoke exposure,” he added. “We’ve made a lot of progress in the preparedness realm,” said Natalie Collins, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, who noted the industry established a smoke exposure taskforce after the losses in 2018 to aid growers after wildfires. The existence of that taskforce hints at a perennial problem for vineyards: though they can often keep wildfire off their acres, there’s little that can keep smoke at bay. And if smoke sits in an area for too long, it can leave grapes tasting ashy, like a campfire. “Smoke taint issues are kind of fickle,” said Heather Griffin, a partner at Summit Lake Vineyards and Winery. “It depends on the varietal, depends on your ripeness level and depends on how long the exposure was.” Griffin’s family’s vineyards were saved from the Pickett fire – “They stopped the fire at the end of our ridge up on Howell Mountain,” she said – but they’ll need to send grapes out for testing before harvest to be sure the smoke didn’t taint it. Protecting the industry For the first year ever, crop insurers are offering a new coverage option called the fire insurance protection smoke index endorsement, which would insure vineyards for losses due to smoke exposure. But some growers say the cost of crop insurance has become unattainable after repeated wildfires. “Our insurance went up so much after the fires of 2020. It literally went from $40,000 a year for really great coverage for all of our properties and inventory, and now it’s $300,000 a year and covers nothing,” said Slone. For the 95% of Napa valley’s wineries that are family-owned, that cost can be “catastrophic”, he adds. The wine industry has historically relied on federal funding to support USDA and university research into wildfire preparedness. Although those levels have remained steady despite widespread federal cuts, eight federal wine grape research scientists – including a smoke exposure specialist – were fired and then rehired early in the Trump administration’s Doge-era cuts. “We want to make sure that an industry like ours continues to be protected,” said Collins, as “we continue to see the writing on the wall in California that wildfires likely will continue to be an issue here”. It’s possible that some federal disaster relief funding may work its way to affected vineyards, but Griffin says buying wine from those wineries “helps everybody that’s up here”. “Shoot them an email and buy some of their wine,” added Slone. “They will be the most appreciative people on the planet Earth.”

25) Here’s what to know about the court ruling striking down Trump’s tariffs — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Donald Trump suffered the biggest defeat yet to his tariff policies on Friday, as a federal appeals court ruled he had overstepped his presidential powers when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country in the world. In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that while US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes. It means the ultimate ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, which were famously based on spurious economic science and rocked the global economy when he announced them in April, will probably be made by the US supreme court. Here’s what to know. Which tariffs did the court knock down? The decision centers on the tariffs Trump introduced on 2 April, on what he called “liberation day”. The tariffs set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners and so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he argued have unfairly treated the US. Lesotho, a country of 2.3 million people in southern Africa, was hit with a 50% tariff, while Trump also announced a tariff of 10% on a group of uninhabited islands populated by penguins. The ruling voided all those tariffs, with the judges finding the president’s measures “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”. They said the tariffs “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration used to pass them. Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, but Trump claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency. The court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.” Trump invoked the same law in February to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, claiming that the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the US border amounted to a national emergency, and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it. Are the tariffs gone now? No. The court largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York that ruled Trump’s tariffs were illegal. But Friday’s ruling tossed out a part of that ruling that would have struck down the tariffs immediately. The court said the ruling would not take effect until 14 October. That allows the Trump administration time to appeal to the majority-conservative US supreme court, which will have the ultimate say on whether Trump has the legal right, as president, to upend US trade policy. What does this mean for Trump’s trade agenda? The government has argued that if Trump’s tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it has collected, which would deliver a financial blow to the US treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159bn by July, more than double what it was at the same point last year. The justice department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean “financial ruin” for the United States. The ruling could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward. The president does have alternative laws for imposing import tariffs, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. In its decision in May, the trade court said that Trump has more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits. How has Trump responded He’s not happy. Trump spent Friday evening reposting dozens of social media posts that were critical of the court’s decision. In a post on his own social media site, Trump claimed, as he tends to do when judges rule against him, that the decision was made by a “highly partisan appeals court”. “If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote. He added: “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.” Trump claimed “tariffs are the best tool to help our workers”, despite their costs being typically borne by everyday Americans. The tariffs have triggered economic and political uncertainty across the world and stoked fears of rising inflation.

26) ‘I’m not coming home’: Trump policy holds people in Ice custody without bail — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Liset Fernandez spent most of the summer worried about her dad, Luis, but a few weeks ago she got some good news. After Luis was held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody for weeks, an immigration judge in Texas granted him release on a $5,000 bond. Luis, who came to the US from Ecuador in 1994, had been held in detention at a facility in Livingston, Texas, thousands of miles away from his home in Queens. Liset, 17, had taken on extra shifts working a retail job to support her mom and nine-year-old brother. Luis’s co-workers at the Square Diner, a railcar-style greasy spoon in Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood for more than 100 years, had raised more than $20,000 to support him and his family. But when Liset logged on to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) website to pay the bond, she got a message telling her that her dad was ineligible for release. It fell to her to tell her dad that instead of coming home that day, he would remain detained. “It was upsetting for everyone,” Liset said. “His voice sounded completely disappointed.” Luis was being detained because of a new DHS policy arguing that all people who enter the US illegally are ineligible for bond, regardless of how long they have been here and whether or not they pose a flight risk. In Fernandez’s case, DHS went even further, deploying a rarely used maneuver to pause the immigration judge’s bond ruling while it appealed his ruling. Federal regulations allow the agency to automatically stay an immigration judge’s bond decision while they appeal the case to the board of immigration appeals. The maneuver means Fernandez will remain detained while his case is pending before the board of immigration appeals. Since the board is being bogged down with appeals, it’s unclear how long it could take to resolve the case, said Craig Relles, an immigration attorney representing Fernandez. Fernandez’s case shows how the Trump administration is “ratcheting up every aspect of the immigration system” for people who are in the US illegally no matter how long they’ve been in the US, said Suchita Mathur, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council. “At every step of the way, they’re inflicting the maximum punishment on people,” she said. “It’s all part and parcel of the administration’s effort to make this process so punitive and unbearable that people give up.” The justice department, which oversees immigration courts, adopted the procedure for automatically pausing an immigration judge’s bond ruling in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks amid concerns about national security. At the time, there were concerns about how it could be used to unjustly detain people. Both Mathur and Relles said they had rarely seen the appeal-and-stay practice used until this summer. Now, they said, the practice is widespread. Lawyers representing the Department of Homeland Security have been instructed to appeal every decision in which someone is granted bond and immediately pause the judge’s ruling while the appeal is pending, according to an agency official familiar with the matter. They have also been told they will be fired if they do not take such action, the person said. Asked whether lawyers were being told to automatically appeal in all cases where bond was granted, the Department of Homeland Security said: “Every decision to appeal is based on the facts of the case. No one has been fired for not appealing a case.” In recent months, federal judges across the country, including in Minnesota, Nebraska and Maryland, have ruled in favor of detained immigrants who have challenged the practice. Appealing the bond ruling and automatically staying an immigration judge’s decision to grant bond, the judges have said, puts the due process rights of detainees at risk. “The government’s discretion in matters of immigration is deep and wide, but surely its chop does not overcome the banks of due process enshrined in the constitution,” Julie Rubin, a US district judge in Maryland, wrote this month in a ruling granting release of an immigrant who was detained even though an immigration judge had ordered bond. “Invocation of the automatic stay renders the [immigration judge’s] custody redetermination order an ‘empty gesture’ absent demonstration of a compelling interest or special circumstance left unanswered by [the immigration judge].” “It seems like there’s a nationwide policy from headquarters instructing them to file these automatic stays,” Mathur said. Such a policy “would raise even more questions about due process. Because if they’re not even conducting individualized analyses before filing these, that’s even more shocking.” The Department of Homeland Security said Fernandez had entered the country illegally and had two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated. The agency did not provide more information on the cases, but told Tribeca Citizen, a local news site, the charges were from 2003 and 2014. “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. But that is not what Fernandez’s co-workers knew of him. At the Square Diner, he was known as a hard worker who would work overtime to support Liset and his nine-year-old son. He was the person who would welcome new employees into the fold, always quick with a joke, and who would cover for someone who needed to step out for an emergency and then give them the earnings they missed. He would FaceTime his kids during long shifts and never say a bad word about customers who were stingy with tips. The only thing he would ever eat at work – sometimes with some teasing – were big salad bowls filled with soup. Usually chicken, but occasionally different types mixed together. The fact that Luis had been in the United States for so long, was working and paying taxes, and had two children who are US citizens made him someone who was clearly eligible for bond, Relles said. “The Department of Homeland Security had the opportunity to present any and all evidence indicating that he was a danger, that there were serious infractions in the past. And he was able to meet his burden, establishing that he was not a danger and is not a flight risk,” Relles said. “He’s human. He has heart,” said one co-worker who asked to remain anonymous because they feared for their safety. “He’s [an] extremely honest person. With money, with food, with anything, you just name it. And the most important thing is the best father.” The co-worker said they had spoken to Luis recently and he was working in the kitchen of the detention center where he is being held. Recently he volunteered to give the other detainees haircuts. The last time Liset saw her dad in person was early in the morning on 24 June when he came to her bedroom to say goodbye. He had been summoned to appear that morning for a check-in on his asylum application in Long Island. The day before he was set to leave, Luis became suspicious that something might happen to him. He shared the location on his phone with Liset. Still, Liset didn’t think there was much to worry about and said goodbye. It was a scorching hot day in New York and Liset went to the beach with her cousin to celebrate the end of the school year and the start of summer vacation. While she was there, Luis called her. She could tell from the tone of his voice that something was wrong. He told her not to worry, but that he was going to be arrested. “They’re going to take me, Ice is here, and I’m not coming home anytime soon,” he told her. “If anything happens, make sure you take care of yourself.” Fernandez is one of thousands of immigrants arrested by the Trump administration as part of its effort to ramp up deportations. Half of the immigrants arrested in the New York City area this year have been arrested, like Fernandez was, at routine check-ins at immigration offices, according to federal data analyzed by the New York Times. Liset didn’t hear from her dad for a few days. But when she eventually got hold of him, he had been transferred to a facility in Texas. Since he’s been detained, Liset has talked to her dad almost every day, usually for just a few minutes. He’s told her that there are about 20 people in his room and that it’s extremely cold because air conditioners are running 24/7. The first few weeks in detention, Liset said, Luis would share a cup of ramen noodles with two other men for meals. Liset described her dad as a hard worker who wanted to make sure his family was taken care of financially while also making sure he could spend time with them. Since her mom only speaks limited English, it’s fallen on Liset to take the lead on her dad’s legal case while also taking on more shifts at work. “This is incredibly draining,” she said.

27) Hypercapitalist hellhole or city of dreams? Behind the cliches, let me show you the real Dubai | Momtaza Mehri — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Dubai is on everyone’s lips. One side of social media salivates over its curated opulence. The other sneers at a city that has become a byword for excess. Barely a week goes by without the British press telling the story of somebody moving to Dubai for lower taxes or, conversely, that the “Dubai dream is dead”. The city-state benefits from this discourse-fuelled soft power. It strikes both the haves and have-notes. Dubai fever is democratic. The city is an El Dorado of the east for remittance-sending strivers, sun-seeking expats and scammers. For many, it represents an unsettling post-western horizon. A version of the future that is already here. Rows of supercars overlooking glittering marinas. Toothy-grinned influencers, crypto bros and aspiring entrepreneurs crowding the same clubs. Labubus dangling from designer handbags. We’re enamoured of this cliche of Dubai, a historyless slab of a place, where the right price can buy you anything and anyone. But behind this binary view is another way of looking at Dubai – a place that is much more interesting and unusual than is often understood. The city’s past and present is often reduced to the 2 sq km of downtown Dubai, where visitors congregate. This is the centre of luxury, where records are made to be broken. It is a panorama of lavish hotels and flashy restaurants, with the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, providing an apt backdrop. This image may be a defining one, but it says very little about the mundane joys and pains of life in Dubai. I remember visiting an industrial district to attend a poetry reading organised by a collective of young Dubai-based Filipinos. Their work grappled with the oddities of second-generation life. What does belonging mean when it isn’t enshrined by citizenship? How do you build a foundation on shifting sands? These locals spoke from within an intensely stratified society in which identities are both fixed and surprisingly porous. Dubai is the natural habitat of the “third culture kid”. Everywhere, you overhear the chameleonic lilt of international school accents. As a Londoner, I speak to Dubai-raised Somalis and recognise the bruised tenderness with which they describe their city. You don’t get to choose your home town. The heart is ungovernable. Today expats make up 85% of Dubai’s population. Through their businesses, schools, cultural centres and social clubs, various diasporas assert their presence. The city hosts the largest Malayali community outside India. Iranian art dealers rub shoulders with Afghan handymen. A Lebanese property developer shares little more than a language with the underpaid north African waiter taking their order. A decade-deep, Sudanese middle class thrives in the very country that is inflaming Sudan’s continuing civil war. Dubai is home to generations of immigrants who have sought shelter and opportunity. Their children face the challenge of reclamation. It has also long been a transit hub, connecting travellers to motherlands that weren’t properly served by European or North American airlines. (Emirates, the flag-carrier airline, savvily capitalised on this, furiously expanding throughout the 1990s and 2000s.) For many, Dubai came to represent hazy layovers and family reunions. Sheer necessity introduced outsiders to the city. Others, including me, visited extended family members who resided in the emirate. The Dubai we encountered was one of polyglot haggling, stuffed suitcases and relentless change. Each layover, each summer, revealed a dramatically transformed city, with towering additions to its skyline. This was the city as pure id, a glittering “urban spectacle” as the scholar Yasser Elsheshtawy put it. Coining the term “Dubaization”, Elsheshtawy named the hyperreal extravagance of the city’s urban landscape, an aggressive, cash-flush development model that has become a global blueprint. Dubai leads, often to where we would rather not follow. Later, as an adult, my trips to the city were defined by work. For a brief spell I lived in Al Raffa, a bustling old neighbourhood. The Dubai I found this time embraced its jostling contradictions. In the Deira district, I shared a platter of Tamil food with a Nigerian film-maker, who recommended a local Ethiopian hairdresser. At a rooftop bar crammed with rowdy South Africans, I met a Somali-American flight attendant recovering from a nervous breakdown. We laughed at the absurdity of seeking stability in a place as transient as Dubai. On another trip, an Ethiopian millennial detailed the humiliations she endured when renewing her residency visa. She had lived in Dubai for most of her life, and had no intention of leaving. I had been aware of the other Dubai, the metropolis behind the myth, but these conversations still disarmed me. The city is attracting a different class of newcomers, those who had never expected to settle there. Dubai has always been a cosmopolitan place – Baloch traders have settled there for centuries, seafaring Emiratis spoke Hindi and the Indian rupee was a local currency well into the 1960s. And there’s nothing new about Britons flocking to a part of the world, the Persian Gulf, that was shaped by British imperialism. As a sheikhdom, Dubai was one of the Trucial States, part of Britain’s informal empire in the Persian Gulf from the early 19th century to 1971. No amount of historical amnesia will change that. The British expat is a stock character of the 20th-century oil boom, with British people working as engineers, administrators, technicians and educators. The “Jumeirah Jane” stereotype was born in that era, a term referring to the leisurely wives of expats who spent their afternoons by the pool. Repelled by Britain’s broken social contract, many of today’s young professionals idealise the tax-free plushness of Dubai life. (It’s worth noting that the confectionery craze Dubai chocolate was invented by a British-Egyptian woman based in the city.) In my own circles, Dubai became a refuge for working-class graduates who felt disproportionately victimised by years of austerity. Their careers flourished in the Gulf, and their passports guarded them against the worst forms of exploitation. For once, they had the upper hand. But the west has a habit of hoarding complexity for itself. The rest of the world is rendered one-dimensional, a vulgar composite of tropes. This lack of curiosity extends even to the migrant labourer, the quintessential symbol of abjection in the Gulf. We live in a time where domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates chronicle their daily lives on TikTok, responding to the comments of interested viewers. For those who are looking, there has never been greater access to the hopes and struggles of low-wage migrants. Contemporary Gulf literature breathes life into stories often reduced to statistics. The children of the city’s labourers are now writing about their parents’ struggles. Dubai Puzha by Krishnadas, Tania Malik’s Hope You Are Satisfied and Deepak Unnikrishnan’s Temporary People depict the modern Gulf metropolis with humanity and humour. Dubai-set Malayalam dramas and films portray migrants scrimping and saving, finding camaraderie along the way. Cinema continues to take a sweeping view of the migrant experience, with films such as Deira Diaries (2021) tracing four decades in the life of a Keralan expat. Such narratives peel away the person from the occupation. Migrant workers become more than objects of pity. Prickly, lovelorn, shrewd, pragmatic; we are increasingly exposed to their inner lives. When it comes to the Singapores, Dubais and Shenzhens of the world, a certain kind of inattentiveness plagues those opining from the west. It’s easier to tell half the story, to bat away complexity. Peer into the crush of glass and sweat, dreams and desperation. Dubai is a funhouse mirror. You’ll see what you want to see. Momtaza Mehri is a writer and researcher.

28) Chairman Trump: has the US turned its back on free-market capitalism? — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     When Ronald Reagan became the first US president to address China’s Great Hall of the People in 1984, he did not waste an opportunity to school his audience on the benefits of the American way. He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party – that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and markets the space the thrive, without intervention – into a simple mantra: trust the people. “These three words are not only the heart and soul of American history, but the most powerful force for human progress in the world today,” Reagan argued in Beijing. “Those who ignore this vital truth will condemn their countries to fall farther and farther behind in the world’s competition for economic leadership.” While Chairman Mao Zedong, founder of the People’s Republic of China, had been fundamentally opposed to free markets and capitalism, Reagan argued that societies which enjoyed “the most spectacular progress” were the ones where people had been “permitted to think for themselves, make economic decisions, and benefit from their own risks”. What would Reagan make of a country that, in a matter of weeks, became the largest shareholder in a microchip manufacturer; demanded a cut of firms’ overseas sales in exchange for export licenses; and fired a statistics official after government data embarrassed its ruling party? In just the past week, senior government officials in the country have pushed to exert control over its central bank; ordered a tech giant to strike a deal with a supportive media conglomerate; and successfully urged a restaurant chain to reverse a rebrand. This is not China. It is the United States, under a Republican president, in 2025. Donald Trump, rather than adhere to the principles of free markets, small government and unbound capitalism that his party championed for a generation, is making his influence felt in every corner of corporate America. The commander-in-chief is also chairman of the economy. Chairman Trump secured a “golden share” in US Steel while approving Nippon Steel’s controversial $14.9bn takeover of the steelworks, and says South Korea will provide $350bn for investments “owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President”, as part of a trade deal he brokered. He converted nearly $9bn in grants for Intel into a 10% stake in the chipmaker – reportedly in exchange for his support, after publicly demanding its CEO resign – and top Trump officials have suggested more companies are in their sights. Chairman Trump is challenging the independence of the Federal Reserve and trying to obtain a majority on the central bank’s board of governors. This week, he even tried to fire one over unconfirmed claims of mortgage fraud, made by an ally inside his administration. He also fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics hours after official data revealed a sharp slowdown in jobs growth on his watch, claiming without evidence that the numbers had been “rigged” (he tapped an ardent supporter to replace her). Rather than allow privately owned companies to go about their business, without the involvement of public officials and political leaders, Chairman Trump routinely intervenes. Under a “little deal” he struck with Nvidia, the world’s most highly valued company will provide 15% of certain chip sales in China. Apple, threatened with steep tariffs by the president, came to the White House bearing gifts: $100bn in further US investment, and a souvenir with a 24-karat gold base. No issue is too small for Chairman Trump. He waded into the debate over the mid-sized casual-dining chain Cracker Barrel’s changed logo earlier this week, dispatching his deputy chief of staff to speak with the firm and ultimately helping convince it to reverse the decision – weeks after pushing Coca-Cola to launch a drink with cane sugar, rather than corn syrup. All the while, Trump’s Republican party continues to accuse political opponents of trying to erode capitalism, pursuing socialism and threatening to undermine free markets. The president’s supporters and officials deny his policies do any such thing. A proposal by Zohran Mamdani, Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, to create five city-owned grocery stores, is “straight out of the Marxist playbook”, according to the Republican congressman Mike Lawler. “New Yorkers deserve solutions, not socialist fantasies that have failed spectacularly every time they’ve been tried,” Lawler argued last month. A spokesperson for Lawler did not respond to a request for comment on whether some of Trump’s policies could be described in similar terms. But asked about conservative criticism of the Intel deal on Wednesday, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, told CNN: “It’s certainly not socialism.” Other rightwingers are not so sure. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul is among the most prominent Republicans to suggest otherwise. “If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?” he asked on X earlier this month. “Terrible idea.” The conservative talk radio host Erick Erickson went further. “You can’t just be against socialism when the left does it,” he said last week. “If you’re not against socialism overall, guess what? You’re going to get socialism.” “So if you support socialism”, Erickson added, “apparently Donald Trump is your guy.” Such arguments miss the point, according to Tad DeHaven, an economic and fiscal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute. There’s no little gold book for Trump to rival Mao’s little red one. “We’re so focused on isms: communism, socialism … and they’re not,” he said of the administration. “There’s no strategic plan here. There’s no guiding philosophy, other than Donald Trump’s in charge. “Donald Trump’s exercising power. Donald Trump doesn’t care about institutions, or constraints, or checks and balances. Donald Trump’s just going to do what Donald Trump wants to do.” Call it Trumpalism. Economic ideologies are typically built on principles, from the free market foundations of capitalism to the socialist pillars of collective ownership and control. But this one – crafted by a man who rarely allows fundamental long-term positions to prevent him from saying, or doing, what he wants in the short term – is different. Back in 2008, with the US auto industry on the brink, Trump said the federal government “should stand behind” the carmakers “100%”. Come 2015, however, this firm stance had dissolved. “You could have let it go bankrupt, frankly, and rebuilt itself … or you could have done it the way it went,” he said of the auto industry. “Either way would have been acceptable.” The lack of a position on whether or not the federal government should have taken stakes in manufacturers, or allowed them to go bankrupt, was an early example of Trumpalism. Ideology takes a backseat to the instincts and impulses of a domineering chairman, from one week to the next. “This is just scattershot, it’s day by day,” DeHaven said. “There’s no plan. There’s no strategy. It’s just power and leverage, and however they can obtain it for the boss, however the boss himself can obtain it. That is the modus operandi.” Whatever happened to trust the people? “You can argue exactly as to when,” said DeHaven, “but the Republican party that I grew up with – the Reagan Republicans – that party is dead and buried”.

29) Women’s Rugby World Cup needs jeopardy to stay in Monday morning conversations | Andy Bull — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     After all these years of asking for more, it’s churlish to complain when the Women’s Rugby World Cup delivered so much in one weekend. England’s victory pulled in two-and-half million prime time viewers on the BBC, 85,000 fans turned out across the four grounds, including a record-breaking 42,000 crowd in Sunderland, five hat-tricks, four packed fan zones, free concerts, and all those fireworks. It had almost everything anyone could have wanted. Almost. The one thing missing was a tight finish. The closest of the eight games was settled by three tries and change. The success of the World Cup isn’t just going to be measured by what happens on the weekends, but in the days in between them. World Rugby wants people to be talking about this tournament when they go into work on Monday morning. And for that to happen it needs some jeopardy. There were 72 tries in eight matches altogether, but 66 of them were by the winning team. England scored 11, so did Australia and Canada. South Africa scored 10. New Zealand eight. Blowouts happen in the pool stages of every Rugby World Cup: there were a bunch of one-sided matches in the men’s tournament two years ago, when France beat Namibia 96-0, New Zealand scored 96 against Italy and Ireland defeated Romania 82-8. The difference this time was in what happened in between. The matches that we hoped would be close turned out anything but, with Scotland beating Wales 38-8 and France beating Italy 24-0. Which didn’t surprise anyone who regularly watches women’s rugby, but maybe requires some explaining to the huge new audience who are only just discovering it. “The numbers don’t always tell the full story,” said World Rugby’s director of women’s rugby, Sally Horrox, when she was asked about it this week. Horrox argues that 49% of women’s rugby fans have come to it in the past two years regardless of how uneven the standard. These scorelines don’t necessarily stop the games from being entertaining. And she’s right, the Red Roses’ victory was as good as a one-sided game gets. No one at the stadium felt it suffered from being so predictable. Like the competition director, Yvonne Nolan, said, there was a lot of “fast, free-flowing rugby”, and plenty to admire in the way the losing teams played. But it’s true, too, that no amount of fireworks or free concerts can disguise the gaps between some of these teams. Women’s rugby needs the enthusiastic support of the media as it grows; its lack of visibility is, World Rugby argues, the biggest obstacle to its success. So there are good reasons why a lot of what is written and said about the women’s game tends to gloss over the obvious imbalances between the teams. The irony is that it’s a sign a sport has matured that everyone involved is able to be honest about what everyone’s watching, instead of celebrating the simple fact that so many people are. To their credit, Horrox and Nolan are both too smart to pretend anything else. They don’t shy away from speaking about the lopsided results, which are inevitable given the uneven pace of development in women’s game around the world. “These teams,” as Nolan says, “are all at different stages of their journey.” Women’s rugby is growing so quickly that the gaps between the teams are actually wider now than they were during the first tournament, back in 1991 (when only one match ended with a 50-point margin) because a handful of sides, and England in particular, have raced so far ahead. This Saturday, a Red Roses side, who have the benefit of all the expert coaching, medical support and sport science the Rugby Football Union can provide and who, because the country has one of the two professional domestic leagues in the world, are paid to play and train seven days a week, take on Samoa, who don’t even have national contracts, and whose team include a full-time property manager, police officer and primary school teacher, who all had to rely on donations to cover the lost income they have suffered by missing work to compete in England. Which invites the question of which is the better achievement, an overwhelming victory for the professionals or an honourable defeat for the amateurs? If they’re honest, the Red Roses will know that given their pedigree and the resources at their disposal, they made too many basic mistakes even when they beat the USA by 62 points. And that, too, may be the result of the fact that they have had so few close matches in recent years that they have been able to get away with being sloppy. World Rugby is doing what it can to help narrow the gap. It has provided all the smaller teams with access to a pool of nine specialist coaches, who work across set pieces, skills, and strength and conditioning, Alain Rolland has been brought in to work with them on how to reduce their penalty counts. But they can’t cover everything. Even Canada, who are one of the strongest teams in this tournament, had to crowdfund the last $1m of the $3.2m they needed to compete. But in the long term, a lot of this will come down to the hard work of widespread structural change, the small steps forward in between the tournaments, as well as the great leaps made during them.

30) Rangers and Celtic fans united in anger going into derby after European disasters — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Never in the history of a derby stretching back to May 1888 and more than 400 matches has the backdrop been as bizarre as this. The yin-and-yang nature of football in Glasgow means supporters of Celtic must be happy because those following Rangers feel dismay, or vice versa. Very occasionally there is general contentment, as in recent times when Rangers could draw kudos from European progress to offset domestic disappointment. As the sides head for Ibrox on Sunday there is outrage. Widespread, collective outrage. In Russell Martin and Brendan Rodgers, we have managers who do not feel compatible with their clubs. Victory for either side in the first Old Firm clash of the season would douse dissenting voices only momentarily. Embarrassment came in different forms for Celtic and Rangers in Europe this week but it was embarrassment nonetheless. Followers of both clubs can be unrealistic in their analysis and demands. In the current context, they are quite right to voice disquiet. Celtic’s scenario is the more complex and bewildering. Rangers simply appear to have erred in the appointment of Martin. He had very little leeway with the Rangers support from the outset and the disorganised shambles that was the 6-0 loss to Club Brugge on Wednesday further inflamed opinion. Rangers were lucky to escape with that level of defeat. Much is said of Martin’s philosophy but a manager who cannot implement basic defensive principles can have no excuses. Rangers’ signing policy is wholly unconvincing. The case for Martin surviving surrounds Rangers’ American owners not being as susceptible to deafening mood music as others before them. The same custodians would also have to admit their first key hire was a disastrous one. There is nothing in Martin’s demeanour or output to suggest he can oversee what would be a remarkable change in fortune. This job looks as if it will swallow him up. “The noise is the loudest I have ever had to deal with as a coach or a player,” Martin admitted. “You have to accept that being here and I knew it would be the case. This job isn’t for the timid. It’s not my job to speculate on or worry about what people on the outside think.” Rodgers returned to Celtic in 2023 with progress in Europe in mind. Domestic dominance was virtually guaranteed. Progress to the knockout phase of last season’s Champions League – where Celtic were unlucky not to defeat Bayern Munich – boosted Celtic’s standing. Since then, there has been regression; key players sold, replacements not sourced. A club with supposedly risk-averse custodians – plus an estimated £100m in the bank – gambled on the biggest prize of all and lost after failing to score against Kairat Almaty over 210 minutes. Celtic will arguably antagonise angry supporters even further by signing players – none of whom should have been out of reach in June – post-Champions League exit. Rodgers has made his frustrations clear since pre-season, albeit he has gradually toned them down. He has refused to confirm that his club are aligned on transfer strategy. The curious thing is that the Irishman has been in this movie before, making agitation plain long before a move from Celtic to Leicester six years ago. On what basis did he return to Glasgow and what change in approach did he expect? Champions League qualifying rounds have tripped Celtic up seven times since 2014 (in two subsequent seasons they did not play in them). On Friday Rodgers stressed harmony within Celtic and talked of a board that “bleeds for the club”. He said: “It is not about investment. This club will invest. The club is super-well run. What we need to look at is the timing of investment.” Failings are collective. Rodgers is far from blameless. Celtic even in diminished form had enough to see off Kairat. The manager’s transfer dealings from last summer – when Arne Engels, Paulo Bernardo, Auston Trusty and Adam Idah arrived for close to £30m – have not affected the starting team to anything like an acceptable extent. Presumably Tony Bloom did not anticipate opportunity arriving so early after the purchase of a 30% stake in Hearts – and the Edinburgh club are not yet positioned to seize upon it anyway – but muddled decisions in Glasgow are proving that the English billionaire may just have backed the right horse again. Supporters of other Scottish clubs will mock, as is their right. Week to week, the Old Firm lord it over those with a fraction of their resources. Yet big-picture terms are hardly appealing. Losses for Aberdeen and Hibernian on Thursday placed further dents in an unimpressive European coefficient. Some chickens are coming home to roost, including in respect of the national team, for a Scottish Premiership that places next to no emphasis on youth development. All focus at Ibrox will be on relieving tensions. Just do not expect that to be the case for long beyond 90 inevitably exhausting minutes.

31) Reform UK councillor suspended from job at Home Office processing asylum claims — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     A local councillor for Reform UK who works for the Home Office processing asylum and immigration claims has been suspended from his job while an investigation is carried out, the Guardian has learned. Paul Bean, who serves as a councillor for Crook ward at Durham county council, declared his day job as a civil servant at the Home Office in his register of interests. It is understood that an investigation by Home Office officials will look at whether any breach of the civil service code has occurred. The code states that all civil servants should be politically impartial and that civil servants must not “allow personal political views to determine any advice you give or your actions”. Bean’s role at the Home Office emerged after an investigation by the organisation Hope Not Hate. The group found posts criticising asylum seekers on a social media account they claim belongs to him. “I work as an asylum decision maker for the HO [Home Office] and I can tell you with authority that 93% of asylum seekers to the UK are men between 18-35 and 92% of them are refused asylum,” a post on the account read, adding: “The truth is the vast majority of asylum seekers are actually economic migrants abusing the asylum system.” According to the most recent statistics, almost half of asylum seekers win their cases, with more granted asylum after an appeal. Another post reads: “97% of asylum seekers are lying about persecution in their home countries and the other 3% have been credible to the point of being believable. Source: me. Guess what job I do.” Other posts on the account use misogynistic language and are heavily critical of Reform, saying Nigel Farage has “submitted” to Islam and looks down on working-class people who give him power. Bean has also been suspended by Reform UK, but it is not known if that is because of his critical comments about Farage and his party or about other posts. Reform UK did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Durham council said: “Due to relevant legislation, Cllr Paul Bean currently remains as a councillor representing Reform UK until we are informed by the party that he has ‘ceased’ to be a member. “Generally, where councillors are suspended as part of their group or party discipline, this is a neutral act pending the outcome of an investigation. Until then, Cllr Bean will continue to sit on the committees he has been appointed to, and our website will reflect his unchanged status.” Amanda Hopgood, the leader of the opposition at Durham county council, said: “It’s only right and proper that this issue is looked into in the interests of openness and transparency. I welcome the fact that the Home Office is looking into this.” Bean was one of 65 Reform UK councillors elected in May to Durham county council, giving the party a large majority and more councillors than the other parties – Liberal Democrats, Greens, independents, Labour and Conservatives – put together. The council was previously run as a coalition between the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and independents. Reform UK’s latest policy announcement is for mass deportation of asylum seekers back to conflict zones such as Eritrea and Afghanistan, a plan Labour has called “pie in the sky”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “While it is our longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases, all civil servants must adhere to the civil service code, and are expected to carry out their role with integrity, honesty, objectivity and political impartiality. “Whenever the civil service code is breached, the matter will be fully investigated and disciplinary action taken as appropriate.” Bean has been approached for comment.

32) Ukraine war briefing: US says strikes ‘cast doubt’ on Russia’s ‘desire for peace’ as Dnipropetrovsk attacked — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region came under a “massive attack” early on Saturday, the region’s governor said, reporting strikes in Dnipro and Pavlograd. “The region is under a massive attack. Explosions are being heard,” Sergiy Lysak wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. He said overnight Russian strikes killed two people in Dnipropetrovsk, which had been largely spared from intense fighting since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Kyiv acknowledged on Tuesday that Russian troops had entered the region. The United States has warned Russia to move toward peace and meet with Ukraine or face possible sanctions at an emergency meeting of the UN security council called on Friday after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 23 people overnight on Thursday. US diplomat John Kelley told the meeting the strikes “cast doubt on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace” and demanded that “these strikes on civilian areas must stop immediately”. He said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy must agree to meet, and reiterated Donald Trump’s warning that Washington could impose sanctions on Russia if the war continues. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned that Trump risked being “played” by Putin if a Russia-Ukraine peace summit did not go ahead. Macron expressed hope that the two-way meeting would take place but warned if Russia did not meet a Monday deadline to agree to the talks, “it will show again President Putin has played President Trump”. The White House responded that Trump is still working on a Russia-Ukraine peace summit. “President Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukrainian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war,” a White House official told AFP. “As many world leaders have stated, this war would have never happened if President Trump was in office. It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.” Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller dismissed the suggestion that the US president had been fooled by Putin. “Such an absurd question,” he said when asked about Macron’s comments. “No president in history has done more to advance the cause of peace. He’s working steadfastly to end the killing, and that’s something that everybody in the world should celebrate.” Zelenskyy said he expected to continue talks with European leaders next week on “Nato-like” commitments to protect Ukraine, adding that Trump should also be involved. “We need the architecture to be clear to everyone,” he said, adding that he wanted to tell Trump “how we see it”. EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen on Friday expressed “broad support” for expanding the bloc’s military training mission to operate inside Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said. “The EU has already trained over 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers,” Kallas wrote on X. “We must be ready to do more.” Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, met with Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in New York on Friday, discussing the need to increase pressure on Moscow. After the meeting, Yermak said on social media that the mass Russian attack on Kyiv on Thursday showed that Moscow “is not even showing any willingness to end the war”. “We also talked about working with American and European partners on security guarantees. This is very important. Without them, it is impossible to look forward,” he said. Russia is building up a force of about 100,000 troops near the eastern Ukrainian stronghold of Pokrovsk, which Russia claims as its territory, Zelenskyy said on Friday. “There is a buildup and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions in any case,” the president told journalists. He added that Ukrainian forces were pushing out pockets of Russian troops from the north-eastern border region of Sumy. North Korean soldiers who died fighting for Russia in Ukraine have been called “martyrs” by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Kim on Friday hosted the families of soldiers, saying they sacrificed their lives to defend the country’s honour, the KCNA state news agency reported. According to South Korea’s intelligence agency, about 600 North Korean troops have been killed from a total deployment of 15,000.

33) US appeals court rules most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. Here are the latest developments: A federal appeals court ruled that most of Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal, but can stay in effect until 14 October, to give time for a supreme court appeal. Trump suggested that the court decision, which affirmed a lower court ruling in May, could spell the end of the United States of America, but added that he expects the supreme court to help him win. Charles Borges, chief data officer of the Social Security Administration, resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging that more than 300 million Americans’ Social Security data was put at risk by staffers from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, who uploaded sensitive information to an insecure cloud server. In 2014, Jim O’Neill, the former biotech investor and current deputy health secretary who was named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week, suggested that the FDA should just let people use drugs before doing any research to show that they work. The Missouri governor, Mike Kehoe, has moved to help the Republican party gain an additional seat in Congress, calling a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts in his state. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, fired two dozen “deep-state” employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s information technology department, including its top leaders, following what she called an unspecified “breach” of its network by a “threat actor”. A federal appeals court in San Francisco blocked Noem from moving ahead with her plan to strip temporary protected status from 600,000 Venezuelans who have permission to live and work in the United States amid turmoil in their homeland. Charles Borges, chief data officer of the Social Security Administration, resigned on Friday due to what he called the agency’s actions against him since he filed a whistleblower complaint this week. In his complaint, Borges alleged that more than 300 million Americans’ Social Security data was put at risk by staffers from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” who uploaded sensitive information to a cloud account not subject to oversight. “I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,” Borges wrote in his resignation letter. The Project Government Accountability Office, which is representing him in his whistleblower case, posted the letter on its website. Borges’ attorney said he “no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience, given what he had witnessed.” It added that he would continue to work with the proper oversight bodies. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old software engineer, was among the Doge officials named by Borges as part of the project to duplicate Americans’ Social Security data and put it on an insecure server. It was Coristine’s recent beating, by two 15-year-olds on a Washington DC street, that Donald Trump used as a pretext for his federal takeover of the capital’s policing. Jim O’Neill, the former biotech investor and current deputy health secretary who was named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week, might lack any experience in health care, but he does have a lot of opinions about the regulation of medicine as a business that could soon be very important. In 2014, when O’Neill was managing director of Mithril Capital Management, a “family of long-term venture capital funds” founded by Peter Thiel, he represented Thiel on the board of the SENS Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to finding treatments for aging, with Thiel’s financial support. That year, when O’Neill gave a talk at at the foundation’s “rejuvenation biotechnology” conference, he argued that development of drugs that might slow or reverse human aging was slowed down by the Food and Drug Administration’s efforts to ensure that drugs are safe and effective. Instead of making sure that drugs work before approving their use by the public, O’Neill said, the FDA should adopt of a system its proponents call “progressive approval”. “We should reform FDA, so that it is approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety and let people start using them, at their own risk, but not much risk of safety”, O’Neill said. “But let’s prove efficacy after they’ve been legalized”. O’Neill, who was standing in front of a slide on how much less efficient biotech startups were than software startups, taken from a book by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters, got a round of applause for the observation. As Jessica Hamzelou reported in the MIT Technology Review in June, O’Neill was suggesting that drugs be made available to the public “after the very first stage of clinical testing, which is designed to test whether a new treatment is safe. These tests are typically small and don’t reveal whether the drug actually works.” That idea is popular though in the longevity community that O’Neill’s patron Thiel is at the center of. It has also been proposed by O’Neill’s current boss, Robert F Kennedy Jr. In May, Kennedy told a longevity podcaster that he wanted to make it easier for people to experiment with treatments that might, or might not, work. “If you want to take an experimental drug … you ought to be able to do that”, Kennedy said. But ditching FDA’s gold-standard of phase 2 and phase 3 trials strikes others as unethical. “It’s just absurd to think that the regulatory agency that’s responsible for making sure that products are safe and effective before they’re made available to patients couldn’t protect patients from charlatans: Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told MIT Technology Review. “It’s just like a complete dereliction of duty.” Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, mocked Donald Trump, the Nobel prize-wanting president, for his hyperbolic claim, after a court ruled that his tariffs are almost all illegal, that “this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America” unless it is overturned. “Yep, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” Krugman wrote on Substack. “Take away these tariffs, and the county will revert to the blasted wasteland it was on … April 1, just before Trump made his big tariff announcement.” Krugman added: It’s important to be clear what just happened. The court didn’t say that tariffs per se are illegal. It said that the procedure Trump used to impose tariffs — declaring an economic emergency, then setting tariff rates without so much as consulting Congress, let alone passing legislation — is illegal. If Trump wants to pass a tariff bill, the same way he passed his One Big Beautiful Bill, OK. (I mean, terrible policy, but legal.) But just saying “I am the Tariff Man, and here are my tariffs” isn’t OK. True, the International Economic Emergency Powers Act gives the president substantial room to set tariffs during an, um, economic emergency. But Trump himself keeps saying that the economy is in wonderful shape, booming without inflation, and any claims to the contrary are fake news. So how can things both be terrific and an emergency calling for drastic action? Donald Trump has said his tariffs are about winning. But in response to his appeals court setback on Friday, California governor Gavin Newsom declared: “Trump is America’s biggest loser.” Newsom and the state’s attorney general Rob Bonta have filed a separate lawsuit against Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, which similarly argues the president lacks the authority to unilaterally impose levies through the IEEPA. That suit alleges that Trump’s global trade war has caused “immediate and irreparable harm” to the state – the world’s fourth largest economy. “And while Trump might be America’s biggest loser, it’s everyday Americans who are paying the price for his failed economic policies,” Newsom said. The Missouri governor, Mike Kehoe, has moved to help the Republican party gain an additional seat in Congress, calling a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts in his state. Kehoe’s announcement on Friday followed a pressure campaign from Donald Trump, who has urged Republican states to reshape district boundaries to more heavily favor Republicans, boosting the party’s chances of maintaining control of the House of Representatives in 2026, despite the unpopularity of his policies. The announcement came hours after Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, signed into law a new congressional map designed to help Republicans gain five more House seats in next year’s elections without winning more votes. Trump has also pushed Indiana lawmakers to redraw that state’s maps, and has also pushed lawmakers in Florida and Ohio to help add three or more Republican-leaning seats. Trump celebrated what he called the prospect of “a new, much fairer, and much improved, Congressional Map, that will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections”. Democratic congressman Emanuel Cleaver, whose district, which includes part of Kansas City, might be redrawn to make his re-election unlikely, denounced the proposed new map as much less fair. “This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation. It will tell the people of Missouri that their lawmakers no longer wish to earn their vote, that elections are predetermined by the power brokers in Washington,” Cleaver said in a statement. “Roughly 40% of Missourians cast their ballots for Democratic candidates last year, and they deserve representation in the People’s House just as much as our Republican neighbors.” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) pointed to a proposal to create a new Republican majority seat by splitting heavily Democratic Kansas City. “Republicans are running scared, and they’ve decided their only hope for maintaining their majority is to pursue a cynical, unpopular scheme to gerrymander congressional maps,” Suzan DelBene, a Washington congresswoman who chairs the DCCC said. “The Missouri constitution, business and community leaders, and common sense all support the idea of Kansas City remaining one, compact congressional district. Donald Trump and DC Republicans’ desire to hold on to power are the only rationale for this re-draw.” The Liberty Justice Center, which filed a lawsuit in April to challenge Donald Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs on behalf of five small businesses that would be damaged by the tariffs, issued a statement to celebrate what it called its second major victory in the case. The lawsuit was filed with the constitutional scholar Ilya Somin and joined by other lawyers, including Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general of the United States during the Obama administration, after Trump administration appealed against his initial loss in the US court of international trade. “For the second time in this case, a federal court has held that the President’s so-called ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs are unlawful,” Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation for the not-for-profit legal center said. “The President cannot lawfully impose tariffs on his own; and IEEPA does not give him unlimited unilateral tariff authority. This decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs.” “The decision today is a powerful reaffirmation of our nation’s core constitutional commitments from our nation’s founders, especially the principle that presidents must act within the rule of law,” Katyal said. “It is that commitment to the rule of law that brought my parents, and millions of others, to this country, and which stands as a beacon of freedom and hope around the globe.” In an interview with MSNBC later on Friday, Katyal pointed out that Trump appeared to acknowledge during his first term that the constitution gave the power to impose tariffs to Congress. “He went and asked Congress for the authority to tariff and they said no. So President Trump this time around just did it on his own”, Katyal said. The US court of appeals for the federal circuit, which ruled on Friday that most of Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal, will allow the import taxes to stay in effect until 14 October, to give the president time to appeal to the supreme court. After ruling, 7-4, that the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs imposed by Trump are not legal, the court paused its order until that date. Donald Trump broke his uncharacteristic silence on the news in recent days by posting an outraged reaction to the federal appeals court ruling that most of his tariffs are illegal. The president’s post, which was shared on an official White House account, began with the all-caps declaration: “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” The court ruling against Trump did say that the tariffs can remain in place until 14 October, giving his administration time to appeal to the supreme court. “Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,” Trump added in his response. The president was quite clear about what he sees as the vehicle for bringing about his preferred end, being granted the power to impose taxes reserved in the US constitution for Congress. “For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,” Trump wrote. “Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation.” Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-rattling tariff policies, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled on Friday. US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”, the court said. The court’s decision will likely mean that the supreme court will have to rule on whether Trump has the legal right as president to upend US trade policy. The court also said the ruling wouldn’t take effect until 14 October. Trump has claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency. The Trump administration has and cited various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners, fentanyl trafficking and immigration – as the reasons for the actions. But a group of small businesses have challenged the administration’s arguments, arguing they are “devastating small businesses across the country.” And on Friday, the appellate court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.” A US appeals court ruled on Friday that most of Donald Trump’s new tariffs are illegal, upholding a ruling from the federal court of international trade that the president’s declaration of an economic emergency to justify sweeping tariffs violates a 1977 law and the US constitution, which reserves taxation for the Congress. As our colleague Dominic Rushe explains, the New York-based US court of international trade previously ruled against Trump’s tariff policies in May, saying the president had exceeded his authority when he imposed both sets of challenged tariffs. The three-judge panel included a judge who was appointed by Trump in his first term. The split decision from the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC addressed the legality of what Trump calls “reciprocal” tariffs imposed as part of his trade war in April, as well as a separate set of tariffs imposed in February against China, Canada and Mexico. The court ruled that the president does have the legal authority to impose narrow, sectoral tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum imports, but he far exceeded his power with the global tariffs on imports he first declared in April. The case, which is expected to be appealed to the US supreme court, hinges of Trump’s broad interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That law gives the president the power to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies, which previous presidents haver used to sanction enemies or freeze their assets. Trump, the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, has claimed the import taxes were justified given trade imbalances, declining US manufacturing power and the cross-border flow of drugs. The law does not mention tariffs, although it allows the president to take a wide range of actions in response to a crisis. Trump’s justice department has argued that the law allows tariffs under emergency provisions that authorize a president to “regulate” imports or block them completely. In ruling against Trump’s interpretation of the law, the court’s majority writes: “we discern no clear congressional authorization by IEEPA for tariffs of the magnitude of the Reciprocal Tariffs and Trafficking Tariffs. Reading the phrase ‘regulate … importation’ to include imposing these tariffs is ‘a wafer-thin reed on which to rest such sweeping power.’” In one of the opinions upholding the lower court’s finding that Trump exceeded his authority, the judges write: “Under the Government’s view, the President could make such a factual finding by merely pointing to a lack of taxes paid on imports from outside the country. But if the President can declare an emergency to cut the deficit by raising taxes in whatever way he wishes, not much remains of Congressional authority over taxation.” The appeals court ruled on two cases, one brought by five small businesses and the other by 12 Democratic-led US states, which argued that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The US constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs, and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited, according to the lawsuits. Another court in Washington DC ruled that IEEPA does not authorize Trump’s tariffs, and the government has appealed that decision as well. At least eight lawsuits have challenged Trump’s tariff policies, including one filed by the state of California. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, fired two dozen “deep-state” employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s information technology department on Friday, including its top leaders, following what she called an unspecified “breach” of its network by a “threat actor”. “While conducting a routine cybersecurity review, the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) discovered significant security vulnerabilities that gave a threat actor access to FEMA’s network”, the homeland security department said in a statement. “The investigation uncovered several severe lapses in security that allowed the threat actor to breach FEMA’s network and threaten the entire Department and the nation as a whole.” The statement said that Fema’s chief information officer, Charlie Armstrong, chief information security officer, Greg Edwards, and 22 other IT employees “directly responsible” were fired. “FEMA’s career IT leadership failed on every level. Their incompetence put the American people at risk”, Noem said. “When DHS stepped in to fix the problem, entrenched bureaucrats worked to prevent us from solving the problem and downplayed just how bad this breach was. These deep-state individuals were more interested in covering up their failures than in protecting the Homeland and American citizens’ personal data, so I terminated them immediately.” The firings came minutes after the department released a long statement attacking the federal emergency management agency that Donald Trump is pushing to close. “FEMA has failed Americans for decades”, the department’s official X account posted at the start of a thread deriding the agency, in which is claimed that “the Biden administration hijacked FEMA to resettle illegal aliens”. A federal appeals court in San Francisco has blocked homeland security secretary Kristi Noem from moving ahead with her plan to strip temporary protected status from 600,000 Venezuelans who have permission to live and work in the United States amid turmoil in their homeland. A three-judge panel of the 9th US circuit court of appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while TPS holders challenge actions by Trump’s administration in court. The judges found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of temporary protected status by the Biden administration because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit it. “In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by Bill Clinton, a Democrat, wrote for the panel. The ruling concluded: “The TPS statute is designed to constrain the Executive, creating predictable periods of safety and legal status for TPS beneficiaries. Sudden reversals of prior decisions contravene the statute’s plain language and purpose. Here, hundreds of thousands of people have been stripped of status and plunged into uncertainty. The stability of TPS has been replaced by fears of family separation, detention, and deportation. Congress did not contemplate this, and the ongoing irreparable harm to Plaintiffs warrants a remedy pending a final adjudication on the merits.” A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Associated Press decision was made by “unelected activist” judges and claimed that, for decades, “the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program.” Congress authorized temporary protected status, or TPS, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, which increased the limits on legal immigration to the United States and was signed into law by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush. The law established “a program for granting temporary protected status and work authorization to aliens in the United States who are nationals of countries designated by the Attorney General to be subject to armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary temporary conditions.” The statute also made clear that it “Prohibits deportation during the period in which such status is in effect.” When speaking about the ongoing turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Miller says, without evidence, that the agency lacked “credibility” and was staffed by “partisan” bureaucrats who weren’t “at all concerned about public health, and weren’t actually very knowledgable about public health”. He goes on to defend health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is facing staunch criticism in the wake of firing CDC director Susan Monarez, and the resignation of several senior public health experts at the agency. “Secretary Kennedy has been a crown jewel of this administration who’s working tirelessly to improve public health for all Americans, and again, to deal with the drivers of the chronic health crisis in this country,” Miller said. Miller also claimed that Kennedy is “one of the world’s foremost voices, advocates and experts on public health”. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, just spoke with reporters at the White House. He said that the administration will be “prioritizing enforcement in these sanctuary jurisdictions as a matter of public safety and national security”, when asked about upcoming immigration raids in so-called “sanctuary cities”, which are predominantly run by Democratic officials. Miller alleged that these cities do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), even when an immigrant commits a crime, saying they don’t comply with detainers issued by Ice. However, the American Immigration Council notes that sanctuary cities do not “shield immigrants from deportation or prosecution for criminal activities”. In a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has continued to make questionable medical and health claims – and has been slammed for them by experts and lawmakers alike. After the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis this week where two children were killed and 17 others injured, Kennedy suggested that psychiatric drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun violence across the country. During an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, the host Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if the health department was investigating whether medications used to treat gender dysphoria might be linked to school shootings. According to court documents reviewed by the Guardian, the 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, had changed their birth name from Robert to Robin because they identified as a woman. In response to Kilmeade’s question, Kennedy, without acknowledging the prevalence and easy accessibility of firearms across the US – said that his department was “launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors] drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence”. This week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify “mitochondrial challenges” in children at airports just by looking at them. Speaking at an event in Texas alongside the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, Kennedy claimed: “I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation. You can tell from their faces, from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I know that that’s not how our children are supposed to look.” In response, Ashish Jha, former White House Covid-19 response coordinator under the Biden administration, said: “I’m sorry but what?” “This is wacky, flat-earth, voodoo stuff, people. This is not normal,” Jha added on X. Read more here: The administration is planning to ramp up immigration enforcement in Boston, Politico is reporting, citing a current and former administration official. According to the official, the latest plans are subject to change, but would involve an increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) personnel in the city. Boston mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, has pushed back against the Trump administration, and said the city would “not back down” from engaging in “sanctuary city policies” outlined by the justice department, including limiting city police from helping Ice agents make arrests. Last week, acting Ice director Todd Lyons also said the increase in immigration enforcement was coming. “Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger Ice presence,” Lyons said in a radio interview. Meanwhile, border czar Tom Homan said this week that immigration raids across several Democratic-led cities would take place after Labor Day. My colleague, Lauren Aratani, has been covering the last days of “de minimis” – a longstanding tariff exemption that let people skip import fees for small-value packages. This ended today, and leaves small businesses and postal services around the world scrambling to apply Donald Trump’s tariffs to millions of shipments. Experts say the change could mean up to $13bn in extra costs and delayed shipping for consumers as businesses adjust to the change. Here’s what you need to know. Donald Trump said he would not be spending $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, in a letter to Republican house speaker Mike Johnson. The rare move, known as a “pocket rescission”, is a request to Congress for the president to not spend appropriated funds towards the end of the fiscal year –which ends on 30 September. Normally, the law stipulates that funding can be paused for 45 days while congress considers such a request. But a pocket rescission means that lawmakers don’t have enough time to act before the funds expire. This would be the first time a president has used the provision in 50 years. It’s already attracted ire from several legislators. Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who chairs the appropriations committee called the president’s actions a “clear violation of the law”. Meanwhile, Democrats decried Trump’s actions. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the finance committee, said the president is a “wannabe king is defunding support that prevents hunger and sickness worldwide”, while congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas said the decision to scrap billions in foreign funding was “wrong and illegal”, and urged his Republican colleagues to “say hell no”. At a hearing in Lisa Cook’s lawsuit, which challenges Donald Trump’s attempts to remove the governor from the Federal Reserve board, her lawyers said that her firing does “irreparable harm” as she’s a Senate-confirmed official who took an oath to carry out her role independently. They asked judge Jia Cobb to allow Cook to remain in her role as the litigation plays out. Cobb didn’t issue a ruling at the hearing. She will have to weigh whether the president had “cause” to terminate Cook, given the broad discretion he has under the Federal Reserve Act. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has signed a new redistricting bill that will redraw the state’s congressional map to heavily favor Republicans. Abbott signed today the highly controversial bill which prompted state Democrats to stage a weeks-long walkout earlier this month. The new districting plans will remove Democratic-majority districts in several major cities including Houston, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Donald Trump has revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, a senior White House official confirmed to the Guardian. Under federal law, former vice-presidents are entitled to receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office. However, Trump’s new directive cancels an undisclosed extension signed by then president Joe Biden before leaving office, according to CNN. Attorney general Pam Bondi said that federal law enforcement had made 86 arrests in Washington DC on Thursday. It brings the total tally of arrests made by federal officers to 1,369, according to the White House. The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department has said in a statement. The US air force has said it is offering military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, a supporter of Donald Trump who was shot and killed by a police officer during the 6 January 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Babbitt, 35, a US air force veteran who lived in California, was fatally shot in the shoulder while she tried to enter a room near the House of Representatives during the riot. “After reviewing the circumstances of [senior airman] Babbitt’s death, the Air Force has offered Military Funeral Honors to [senior airman] Babbitt’s family,” the air force said in a statement seen by Reuters. The funeral honors would mark the latest gesture of support from Trump’s administration toward those who stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying his 2020 election loss. Trump has repeatedly made false claims that his 2020 loss to Joe Biden was due to voter fraud. He and his supporters have sought to portray Babbitt as a martyr who was unjustly killed as she attempted to climb through a broken window of a barricaded door leading to the speaker’s lobby, a few feet from where members of Congress were waiting to be evacuated to safety during the attack. An internal investigation by the US Capitol Police cleared the officer who shot Babbitt of wrongdoing in 2021 and said he would not face internal discipline. More than 1,500 people were criminally charged for participating in the riot. Trump pardoned nearly all of them, and released those who had been imprisoned. A controversial portrait of General Robert E Lee, which shows an enslaved man holding the Confederate leader’s horse, is being returned to the library at West Point, according to Pentagon officials who spoke with the New York Times. The nearly 20ft canvas, which had hung in the US military academy since 1952, was removed following a 2020 law that ordered Confederate names and tributes to be stripped from military installations. That same law established a commission to rename bases and review monuments. By 2022, the commission directed West Point to clear away all items that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy”. Shortly after, the Lee portrait was taken down and placed in storage. Exactly how the painting is being reinstalled without countering the legislation remains uncertain. The measure was passed in the wake of nationwide demonstrations after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police. Both Donald Trump and the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have pushed for the restoration of Confederate symbols that were removed in recent years. Hegseth, in particular, has pressed for reinstating a Confederate memorial at Arlington national cemetery that Congress recommended removing. In an August social media post, he wrote that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings”. Hegseth moved to reinstate Confederate general names at army bases such as Fort Bragg and Fort Lee earlier this summer, but did so in a way that attempted to stay within the boundaries of the 2020 law. The new names honored different soldiers, none of whom had fought for the Confederacy, yet the names were the same as those of the original Confederate honorees. In response to Abbott’s signing of the gerrymandered map pushed by Trump into law, Texas Democratic party chairman Kendall Scudder issued this statement: With a stroke of the pen, Greg Abbott and the Republicans have effectively surrendered Texas to Washington, DC. They love to boast about how “Texas Tough” they are, but when Donald Trump made one call, they bent over backwards to prioritize his politics over Texans. Honestly, it’s pathetic. I am proud of the Texas Democrats in the House and Senate who chose to fight, whether by a constitutionally protected quorum break, questioning these mapmakers, trying to pass amendments, or even attempting to filibuster. This isn’t over – we’ll see these clowns in court. We aren’t done fighting against these racially discriminatory maps, and fully expect the letter of the law to prevail over these sycophantic Republican politicians who think the rules don’t apply to them. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has signed a new redistricting bill that will redraw the state’s congressional map to heavily favor Republicans. Abbott signed today the highly controversial bill which prompted state Democrats to stage a weeks-long walkout earlier this month. In a video on X, Abbott can be seen signing the bill and says it “creates the one big, beautiful map that ensures fairer representation in the United States Congress for Texas”. Abbott’s signing comes after the Texas house of representatives approved the new map – which is set to create as many as five additional Republican congressional districts – on an 88-52 party-line vote. The state senate then approved the bill early on Saturday. After the house’s approval, Donald Trump took to Truth Social and wrote: “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.” “Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing,” he added. The bill’s passage follows Trump’s request for the state to draw new congressional maps. Currently, 25 of Texas’s 38 districts have Republican majorities. The new redistricting will bring the Republican-favored districts to 30. The new districting plans will remove Democratic-majority districts in several major cities including Houston, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department has said in a statement. The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports. It follows the imposition of US sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July, even as other western powers have moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood. In a statement, the state department said that “it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace”. Officials with the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, reject that they have undermined peace prospects, Reuters reports. Under the 1947 UN “headquarters agreement” the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons. The state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate. CBS News is reporting that Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa plans to reveal next week that she won’t seek reelection in 2026. Ernst, 55, who has served in the Senate since 2015, plans to make the announcement on Thursday, CBS reported citing multiple sources familiar with the matter. Per CBS’s report: Some Iowa Democrats have already jumped into the race, including state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek, and Des Moines School Board chairwoman Jackie Norris. Ernst has been evasive about whether she would run for a third term in 2026, but in public remarks earlier this month, predicted continued GOP control of Iowa. “Every day we get a new Democratic member of the House or Senate that decides to run for this Senate seat — bring it on,” she said at a meeting of the Westside Conservative Club. “Bring it on, folks. Because I tell you, at the end of the day, Iowa is going to be red.” White House officials had hoped Ernst would run again, instead of joining other Republicans who are leaving the Senate, including North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, Alabama’s Tommy Tuberville and Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell. In a rebuttal, Abbe Lowell, Cook’s lawyer, offers a stern indictment of Trump’s basis for “cause”. “Any reason is now cause,” Lowell says. “That could possibly mean the president decides it was cause because Governor Cook decides to attend to a meeting in a pant suit instead of a dress, and he didn’t think that has enough respect for the institution. That’s cause.” Trump’s lawyer is citing case precedent now when it comes the question of Cook’s firing doing “irreparable harm”. “The harm of having a somebody in office who was wrongfully there outweighs the harm of somebody being wrongfully removed from office,” he says. The lawyer for the administration is going back-and-forth with Judge Cobb now, arguing that Cook has, in fact, had the opportunity to respond to Bill Pulte’s allegations. “No response, no intent, no letter saying: ‘hey, I disagree with this’,” Trump’s lawyers say. We’re now hearing from Trump’s lawyers. The justice department says that it doesn’t “see the argument that for a very senior financial regulatory official making contradictory representations on financial documents with no explanation” isn’t grounds for removal. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, is arguing that her firing does “irreparable harm”. He says that Cook ultimately took an oath before Congress, and what she’s being “deprived of” is more than a paycheck, but the ability “to satisfy the oath” she took and “not to be removed from anything but cause”. He added that while this lawsuit works its way through the court, the “status quo” should stay in place: She [Cook] should not be taken out of her office. She shouldn’t be disconnected to her electronics. She should be able to participate in the meeting. She should do all the things that she did a week ago before all this started, because that is the status quo. Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be barred from performing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, under new rules proposed by the Trump administration. The draft regulations, which also forbid providers from counseling female veterans about terminating a pregnancy, have generated nearly 20,000 comments in the federal register from conservative activists, abortion rights supporters and female veterans, many of them survivors of sexual assault. “I am a veteran, a mother, and my abortion saved my life,” wrote Mary Dodson-Otten, a 41-year-old nurse and air force veteran who lives outside Atlanta, Georgia. Dodson-Otten told the Guardian she ended a pregnancy in her 20s after she got pregnant by an abusive boyfriend who was a fellow service member. Without the abortion, she said, “I don’t think I would have survived, whether it would have been him hurting me or me hurting me.” The rule proposed by the Trump administration has an exception that allows abortions to take place “when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. But abortion rights advocates said the exception was too limited. “Women are going to die,” predicted Caitlin Russell, a former US army captain who served two tours in Afghanistan and studies female veterans’ health at the University of Pennsylvania. Lowell now says that the charges of mortgage fraud are not clear in Pulte’s “middle-of-the-night allegations” on social media. He underscores that Cook has not had the chance to respond, and tell her “side of the story” in a hearing. A notable exchange here. Lowell says that “motive” alone is not what Cook’s counsel is disputing here. Instead, he says that a bad motive can “illuminate” that there was “no cause to begin with”. He characterizes Trump’s surrounding pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates as crucial context for the president’s willingness to fire Cook “on the basis of a single social media posting”. Lowell is running through the events that led to Cook’s attempted firing. Namely that the president cited Bill Pulte’s referral letter, which says that Cook “appears” to have done something wrong, when he fired the governor via a post on Truth Social. There wasn’t any “investigational charge”, as Lowell notes. Lowell says that Judge Cobb would need to determine what constitutes as “cause” in this case. Without getting into the legal weeds here, “cause” isn’t defined in the Federal Reserve Act, so the Trump administration argues the president can have a broad basis to fire Cook. Lowell argues that “cause” is the crux of this case. A hearing in Lisa Cook’s lawsuit, challenging the president attempts to remove her from the Federal Reserve board of governors, has started. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, confirms that they’re seeking a temporary restraining order to block the president’s from firing the governor. We’ll bring you the latest developments here. Attorney general Pam Bondi said that federal law enforcement had made 86 arrests in Washington DC on Thursday. This includes a “suspected Tren de Aragua gang member”, she wrote in a post on X. Bondi added that 1,369 arrests had been made since the beginning of the federal law enforcement surge earlier this month. Per my earlier post, a reminder that we have a hearing in the lawsuit filed by fired Fed governor Lisa Cook, challenging her termination by Donald Trump. A DC federal judge, Jia Cobb, will hear arguments at 10am ET today in the case. A reminder that Cook hasn’t been charged with a crime. The president alleges she has committed mortgage fraud, based on claims cited in a letter sent by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Donald Trump has revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, according to a letter obtained by CNN, and confirmed to the Guardian by a senior White House official. The letter, dated on Thursday and titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security”, instructs the Secret Service to “discontinue any security-related procedures beyond those required by law” effective 1 September 2025. Under federal law, former vice-presidents are entitled to receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office. For Harris, that period ended on 21 July. However, CNN reports that her protection had been extended for an additional year, under an undisclosed directive signed by then president Joe Biden before leaving office. Trump’s new directive cancels that extension. “You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the letter reads. All Democrats on the Senate banking, housing, and urban affairs committee have signed a letter to Republican chair Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina, to postpone Stephen Miran’s confirmation hearing to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors – scheduled for next week. The lawmakers say that Donald Trump’s decision to fire Lisa Cook earlier this week is an “unprecedented attempt” to “undermine” the US central bank’s independence. Instead, the Democrats say the committee should “hold an oversight hearing on the legal and economic implications of the President’s actions”. The added in the letter: We have a responsibility to the American public to ensure that the Federal Reserve is making decisions that are in the best interest of businesses and households, pursuant to its congressional mandate, not based on the whims of the President. Important to note that Miran was announced as the president’s pick to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned early from her post. If confirmed, Miran would fulfill the remainder of Kugler’s term, which expires at the end of January. If Trump’s attempt to oust Cook from the Federal Reserve board is successful, that would create another vacancy for him to nominate a governor. Hernán was at the Latin American restaurant that he owns with his brother in north-west Washington DC last week when his staff started getting phone calls and messages about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) checkpoints in the neighborhood. The employees, scared that they might be targeted and racially profiled, asked if they could go home. Within hours, Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn’t been open since. “Literally after President Trump brought the national guard on DC, everything stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of Ice retaliation. “Everything disappeared because the bike delivery guys, they’re scared. They’re not on the streets right now. My people, most of my cooks are Spanish[-speaking] and they don’t want to go to DC right now.” Hernán, who also owns a restaurant in Maryland, said he was hoping to be able to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration’s takeover of the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent. But the future is unclear for him and many restaurant owners in the US capital. Already suffering from fewer customers due to the administration’s almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with staff shortages because many immigrants, both documented and undocumented, fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by Ice. Donald Trump doesn’t have any public events scheduled today, according to the White House. We’ll keep you updated if that changes, and also keep an eye out for any posts on Truth Social or impromptu press availability. A visit to Taiwan by two US senators has drawn criticism from China, which claims the island as its own and objects to any contact between officials of the two sides. The chair of the Senate armed services committee, Roger Wicker, and the Nebraska senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a series of high-level meetings with senior Taiwanese leaders to discuss US-Taiwan relations, regional security, trade and investment, according to the American Institute in Taiwan, Washington’s de facto embassy in lieu of formal diplomatic relations with the self-governing island democracy. Upon arrival, Wicker said: A thriving democracy is never fully assured … and we’re here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace. Wicker told Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, during a meeting at the presidential office in Taipei that he and Fischer were visiting to get a better understanding of Taiwan’s needs and concerns. “We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,” Wicker said. “At a time of global unrest, it is extremely significant for us to be here,” Fischer added, noting that discussions would include “security, opportunities and progress for this part of the world”. Nearly 1,000 “worker over billionaire” protests are being planned in all 50 states starting this weekend as part of a Labor Day week of action organized by labor unions and advocacy groups in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies. The actions include marches and rallies in cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles, a Labor Day parade in New York City, rallies in Palmer, Alaska, Freeport, Maine, and a planned protest at the state capitol in Honolulu, Hawaii. The protests are organized by the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, and dozens of partner organizations, including Public Citizen, Indivisible, Democracy Forward, MoveOn and Patriotic Millionaires. “This is about organic, grassroots organizing, and we intentionally wanted it to be outside of Washington DC, because that’s where the impacts are being felt,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, said. “Whether it’s teachers or nurses or construction workers, they’re all determined to stand up and fight back, because they’re experiencing the cuts, they’re experiencing the change in policies, they’re experiencing the attacks of this White House on their unions, and so they’re determined to make their voices heard and mobilize to fight forward regardless of what’s happening around us, no matter the obstacles.” Patty Murray, the Washington senator, has called for the Trump administration to provide “immediate answers” about reports that two firefighters were detained by border agents as they were responding to a wildfire in the state. Federal immigration authorities on Wednesday staged an operation on the scene of the Bear Gulch fire, a nearly 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) blaze in the Olympic national forest, where they arrested two people who were part of a contract firefighting crew, the Seattle Times first reported. The fire is the largest currently burning in the state. Authorities made the firefighters line up to show ID, the Seattle Times reported. One firefighter told the newspaper that they were not permitted to say goodbye to their detained colleagues. “I asked them if his [co-workers] can say goodbye to him because they’re family, and they’re just ripping them away,” the firefighter said to the Seattle Times, adding that the federal agent swore and told the firefighter to leave. The operation sparked widespread condemnation in the state. Murray in her statement released on Thursday morning demanded information about the whereabouts of the firefighters and the administration’s policy around immigration enforcement during wildfires. Meanwhile, the White House has requested that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as the Trump administration plans a broader takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”. On Thursday, the Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security had reached out for assistance, telling the Associated Press that the DHS had requested “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations”. An NSGL spokesperson told the outlet that no decisions have been made regarding the request and that the base has not yet received any official request to support a national guard deployment. The Guardian has reached out to the NSGL for comment. In a statement to the Guardian, a DHS spokesperson said: “President Trump has been clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again. Across the country, DHS law enforcement are arresting and removing the worst of worst including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists that have terrorized American communities. Under secretary [Kristi] Noem, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] are working overtime to deliver on the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.” The signal from the Trump administration comes just a few weeks after the president directed a federal takeover of Washington DC – deploying the national guard, taking over the police department, and ramping up immigration raids and deportations in the city. President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he says is runaway crime. Yet data shows most violent crime in those places and around the country has declined in recent years. Homicides through the first six months of 2025 were down significantly compared to the same period in 2024, continuing a post-pandemic trend across the US, AP reports. Trump, who has already taken federal control of police in Washington, DC, has maligned the six Democratic-run cities that all are in states that opposed him in 2024. But he hasn’t threatened sending in the Guard to any major cities in Republican-leaning states. John Roman, a data expert who directs the Center on Public Safety &amp; Justice at the University of Chicago, acknowledged violence in some urban neighborhoods has persisted for generations. But he said there’s no US city where there “is really a crisis.” “We’re at a remarkable moment in crime in the United States,” he said. Senator Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of the strongest advocates for Taiwan in the US Congress, arrived in Taipei on Friday to discuss security as China ratchets up its military pressure on the island. Wicker, a Republican, said he and Senator Deb Fischer were visiting to reinforce the “great partnership” the United States and Taiwan had and would have in the future, Reuters reports. Fischer is also a Republican and a member of the Armed Services Committee. “We’re here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace, the kind of peace through strength that Ronald Reagan talked about,” he told reporters at Taipei’s downtown Songshan airport, referring to the late US president. “We stand here to re-emphasise the partnership and the security friendship agreement that the United States has had with Taiwan for some decades.” The US Senate is due to consider next week the National Defense Authorization act, or NDAA, a nearly $1 trillion bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. Wicker said that this year’s NDAA would “add to the provisions again” when it came to Taiwan, though he gave no details. The White House has chosen a top aide to health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr to temporarily lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – an appointment that is expected to bolster Kennedy’s goals of remaking federal vaccine policy. Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush administration, was tapped as acting director of the agency that oversees vaccine recommendations, a White House official confirmed to the Guardian. O’Neill, unlike Monarez, has no training in medicine or infectious disease science. He is a former speechwriter for the health department, during the Bush years, who went on to work for the tech investor and conservative megadonor Peter Thiel. But who is O’Neill and what does he want to do at the CDC? Read our full explainer here: Senior CDC vaccine research and public health leaders who resigned in protest told hundreds of supporters across the street from the campus on Thursday that the Trump administration needs to “get politics out of public health”. The agency is reeling from the firing of the CDC chief, Susan Monarez, but Monarez, who was confirmed as CDC chief just a month ago, has refused to be removed. Three senior leaders – Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel Jernigan – resigned shortly after in protest, citing the alleged spread of misinformation under the Trump administration and political interference in their work. The staffers cheered and applauded them at the event on Thursday. “You are the people that protect America, and America needs to see that you are the people that protect America, and we are going to be your loudest advocates,” said Daskalakis to the throng. Daskalakis, who was accompanied at the rally by Houry and Jernigan, is now the former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and is known for his leadership in HIV prevention and vaccination programs and the Biden administration’s response to the mpox outbreak. The three, plus Jennifer Leyden, who led the office of public health data, resigned together on Thursday to make a statement about the damage the administration had done to public vaccine research, and in protest of the administration’s response to vaccine disinformation, they said. “We agreed to do this together. We’ve been talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,” said Houry, the CDC’s former chief medical officer. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it’s more powerful and just shows the state of our agency.” She and the others are asking for Congress to intervene, to put a stop to political interference in the organization’s work. The chaos at the CDC is far from the president’s only battleground todat. Later on, Donald Trump’s battle to exert control over the Federal Reserve faces a key legal test, with a governor of the central bank seeking a temporary block on his extraordinary attempt to fire her. Lisa Cook sued the US president on Thursday, with her lawyers describing his attempt to dismiss her as “unprecedented and illegal”, and based on “pretextual” allegations. The case is widely expected to be ultimately decided by the supreme court. While it makes it way through the courts, Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order against Trump’s attempt to “immediately” dismiss her from the Fed’s board. A hearing on the motion is set for 10am in Washington on Friday. The case has been assigned to US district judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of Joe Biden. Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her that he was removing her from her position “effective immediately”, based on the allegation from one of his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she incorrectly described as her primary residence. The president has spent months attacking the Fed, where most policymakers – including Cook – have so far defied his calls for interest rate cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building “a majority” on the central bank’s board, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight. Read the full report here: Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours. We begin with news that the White House has chosen a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr to serve as the acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a decision that comes as the standoff over the firing of director Susan Monarez has deepened, with Monarez’s lawyers claiming she will not depart unless Donald Trump himself removes her. A White House official confirmed to the Guardian that Jim O’Neill, currently the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), had been selected to temporarily lead the public health agency, giving Kennedy an ally in his efforts to overhaul US vaccine policy. Unlike Monarez, O’Neill, a former investment executive, does not have a medical or scientific background. He served as a former speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush administration, and went on to work for the tech investor and conservative megadonor Peter Thiel. Senator Bill Cassidy, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, called on the department’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to indefinitely postpone its upcoming 18 September meeting. He said: Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting. Meanwhile, senator Susan Collins said she was “alarmed” by Monarez’s firing, adding: Susan Monarez is a highly capable scientist who brought a wealth of experience to the agency. While I recognize that the CDC director serves at the pleasure of the president, I am alarmed that she has been fired after only three weeks on the job. Last night I talked with former director Monarez about her removal. I agree with chairman Bill Cassidy, who heads the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the CDC, that this matter warrants congressional oversight. It came as senior CDC vaccine research and public health leaders who resigned in protest told hundreds of supporters across the street from the campus on Thursday that the Trump administration needs to “get politics out of public health”. In other developments: The president is gravely serious about running for a third term in violation of the US constitution, California governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday, warning Americans to “wake up” to what he described as Trump’s flagrant disregard for democratic norms. “I don’t think Donald Trump wants another election,” Newsom, a Democrat, said during a live interview at a summit hosted by Politico in Sacramento. “This guy doesn’t believe in free, fair elections.” The White House has requested that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as the Trump administration plans a broader takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”. On Thursday, the Naval Station Great Lakes confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had reached out for assistance, telling the Associated Press that the DHS had requested “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure and other logistical needs to support DHS operations”. The air force will provide military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, the rioter fatally shot during the January 6 Capitol attack, marking another step in Donald Trump’s aggressive rehabilitation of the attack. A Washington senator has called for the Trump administration to provide “immediate answers” about reports that two firefighters were detained by border agents as they were responding to a wildfire in the state. Seven people have arrived in Rwanda as part of a deal to accept deportees from the US, the Rwandan government has said. The Trump administration has been negotiating arrangements to send people to third countries including South Sudan and Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, as part of its wider deportation drive. The family of 18-year-old Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz was shocked when they found out that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had discreetly moved him out of California, according to California congresswoman Luz Rivas, who spoke with his relatives and reviewed federal detention records.

     A US federal appeals court has ruled that most of president Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal, describing the levies as “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”. The ruling, which will take effect on 14 October, is the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policy and will likely mean the supreme court will have to rule on whether Trump has the legal right as president to upend US trade policy. Reacting to the decision on social media, the president said: “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” If allowed to stand, the ruling would “literally destroy the United States of America”, he added. The president on Friday also revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 election rival Kamala Harris after it was extended by Joe Biden before he left office. The move has been slammed by some as “another act of revenge”. Here are the key stories: Most of Trump’s tariffs are illegal, federal court rules Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-rattling tariff policies, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled on Friday.

The teenager, a US citizen with disabilities, was in a vehicle with his mother outside Arleta high school in Los Angeles on 11 August when masked immigration agents surrounded them and pulled them from the vehicle.

     Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-rattling tariff policies, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled on Friday. US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”, the court said in the 7-4 ruling. Many of Trump’s steep tariffs are “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”, the ruling added, and “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration has leaned on. The court’s decision is the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policies and will likely mean the supreme court will have to rule on whether he has the legal right as president to upend US trade policy. The court said the ruling would not take effect until 14 October. “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” Trump wrote on social media, moments after the ruling came down, after the stock markets closed before a three-day weekend in the US. In a lengthy post, he accused the appeals court of political bias. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” he continued. “At the start of this Labor Day weekend, we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers, and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.” The ruling voided Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs that set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners and his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he has argued have unfairly treated the US. Trump has claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency. The Trump administration has cited various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners, fentanyl trafficking and immigration – as the reasons for the actions. But a group of small businesses has challenged the administration’s arguments, arguing the tariffs are “devastating small businesses across the country”. And on Friday, the appellate court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.” The ruling also said the US law “neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president’s power to impose tariffs”. Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that the administration, worried the court might invalidate the tariffs immediately, filed statements by Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, warning that such a decision would be a “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment” for the US. In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that Trump “lawfully exercised the tariff powers granted to him by Congress to defend our national and economic security from foreign threats”. He said: “The president’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.” William Reinsch, a former senior commerce department official now with the Center on Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters that the Trump administration had been bracing for this ruling. He said: “It’s common knowledge the administration has been anticipating this outcome and is preparing a plan B, presumably to keep the tariffs in place via other statutes.” The US trade court heard the case – VOS Selections Inc v Trump – in May, and ruled that the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. But the court agreed to a temporary pause in the decision pending an appeal hearing. The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC heard oral arguments about the case on 31 July. Judges expressed skepticism about the administration’s arguments at the hearing. The IEEPA “doesn’t even say ‘tariffs’”, one of the judges noted. “Doesn’t even mention them.” In its ruling, the appeals court noted there were “numerous statutes” that do delegate the power to impose tariffs, in which “clear and precise terms” are used to this make clear. When Congress wants to delegate such authority, it typically “does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an overall structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs”, the court added. It said: “The absence of any such tariff language in IEEPA contrasts with statutes where Congress has affirmatively granted such power and included clear limits on that power.” Trump’s tariffs have triggered economic and political uncertainty across the world and stoked fears of rising inflation.

36) ‘Jeff Buckley was a once-in-a-lifetime’: Australia’s 30-year love affair with an enduring, tragic talent — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/30/jeff-buckley-30-year-anniversary-first-australia-tour
   Text:
     You had to see Jeff Buckley to believe him. Jon Pope, a veteran of the Australian music industry, was tour manager for the singer on his first visit to Australia, in 1995. Three days after Buckley’s first show at the Metro in Sydney on 28 August, the road crew were preparing for a much more intimate gig at the Lounge in Melbourne for an audience of a few hundred. Pope had an unusual request to make, per Buckley’s management. “You know those old cash registers that would go ‘ping’ when the tray would pop out? I had to tell them to turn them all off,” he remembers, laughing. The bar manager was aghast. “You’ll understand why when he starts playing,” Pope tried to reassure him. When Buckley and his band took the stage, the effectiveness of the edict became apparent. Buckley’s voice, and his band, soared and swooped. It was a masterclass in dynamics: in the silences between and sometimes during songs (the brief drop-out in So Real, for example), you could hear the proverbial pin drop. It is now 30 years since that first tour by Buckley to Australia (where his career first began to gain international traction) and 31 years since the release of his only finished album, Grace. The anniversary coincides with a revival of interest in Buckley, with a documentary, It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley, showing first at Sundance and the Melbourne international film festival earlier this month. And in September, singer Katie Noonan is touring a 20-date Buckley tribute show, with shows at Melbourne’s Hamer Hall and Sydney’s Enmore theatre already sold out. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As an 18-year-old, Noonan saw Buckley for the first and only time on his second and last tour of Australia, in February 1996. “I had never heard a voice used that way – never before, never since,” she says. “He was a once-in-a-lifetime.” Buckley’s death in 1997 at the age of 30 (an impromptu swim in the Wolf River in Memphis ended tragically when he was dragged underwater by a passing tugboat and drowned) has left a difficult legacy. A contentious unfinished album, Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, was released in 1998, followed by a seemingly endless stream of live recordings and assorted barrel-scrapings. Those live recordings are almost all variations of the songs Buckley recorded for Grace, one of the most acclaimed albums of the last three decades. Buckley simply didn’t live long enough to fulfil his enormous talent. Overfamiliarity has bred a degree of contempt. So too the many pale imitators, not to mention the buskers laying waste to his version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah on seemingly every street corner. As a witness to those shows though, I can confirm: Buckley was the real deal. A few days after his performance at the Lounge, I drove 13 hours from Brisbane to Sydney to see the last gig of the tour at the Phoenician Club, recorded by Triple J for Live at the Wireless. (I still give thanks to my then-partner, who brazenly purchased our tickets before we were officially an item.) He had it all. He could sing like a bird, he was a great guitar player, he was a superb bandleader, he had the songs (Lover, You Should Have Come Over sounded like an instant standard). He was also a gifted interpreter of other artists’ material: no one else could tear through the MC5’s Kick Out the Jams, then slip effortlessly into Nina Simone’s crushing Lilac Wine. It didn’t hurt, of course, that he was terribly good-looking. Warwick Brown, who runs the Melbourne record emporium Greville Records, was an early convert. Already a fan of Buckley’s father Tim, he’d heard Jeff’s first release, the EP Live at Sin-é, before Grace appeared in August 1994. “The day it came in, we stayed back after work to smoke a joint and lie on the floor and listen to it,” he remembers. “It just blew our minds.” Brown points out that if Buckley isn’t exactly a hip name to drop now, he wasn’t at the time, either. Coming at the tail end of grunge, Buckley was covering Van Morrison, Édith Piaf, even Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Alongside Hallelujah and Lilac Wine, Grace also featured a rendition of Benjamin Britten’s Corpus Christi Carol as delicate as gossamer. But it wasn’t an instant hit. “It was the sort of record you had to turn people on to, which is hard to believe these days,” Brown remembers. The Lounge show was full of hardcore music nerds, so perhaps Buckley was preaching to the choir, but once the show finished, “everyone was a fanatic”. By the time his Australian tour finished at the Phoenician Club, he was a star. Six months later, Buckley was back in Australia, playing more shows to much bigger rooms. “We tripled the audience,” Pope says. It was unusual for an international artist to return to Australia within such a short time frame, but Australia (and increasingly France) remained his stronghold. Back in the United States, he was still a cult act. Noonan drove from Brisbane down to Seagulls, a sports club on the Gold Coast, to see him: “It was a hugely transformative event in my life. I just went, whatever this band is doing, I want to do that, whatever that is.” But to Brown, Buckley looked exhausted at this point. “I heard someone say ‘It’s great to have you back,’ and he said, ‘I haven’t been home since last time I was here.’” After Buckley died, he says, “It was so painful that I don’t think I could listen to him for a long time without that sadness that came with it. I just couldn’t believe it. It was such a tragic, silly way to die, and I wish we were talking about his fifth album, not his first one. He was a phenomenal artist.” It is the younger music fans who come through Brown’s shop who are the acid test of Grace’s longevity. “We’re all jaded old men, but then 20-year-olds come in and go, ‘What the fuck is this?!’ That’s a sign of good music. Grace is a record that just never stops selling. We would sell a copy of that record every single day.” Really, though. You had to be there.

37) Chicago mayor signs order to resist possible Trump troop deployment — Al Jazeera (2025-08-30)

     Mayor Brandon Johnson says order aims to protect residents from ‘threats and actions of out-of-control administration’.
     By Al Jazeera Staff
     The mayor of Chicago has signed an executive order seeking to protect residents against a possible decision by United States President Donald Trump’s administration to deploy federal troops to the city.
     Mayor Brandon Johnson announced on Saturday that he was signing the so-called Protecting Chicago Initiative amid what he said were “credible reports” that Chicago could see militarised activity by the federal government within days.
     “It is unclear at this time what that will look like exactly,” the mayor said at a news conference. “We may see militarised immigration enforcement. We may also see National Guard troops . We may even see active duty military and armed vehicles in our streets.”
     Among other things, the order directs Chicago law enforcement officers not to collaborate with US military personnel on patrols or during immigration enforcement activities, Johnson told reporters.
     He described the move as “the most sweeping campaign of any city in the country to protect ourselves from the threats and actions of this out-of-control administration”.
     Johnson’s announcement comes after Trump earlier this month said that he was considering whether to expand his National Guard troop deployment from Washington, DC, to other major cities across the country.
     Trump called up the National Guard in what he said was a push to address crime in the US capital. The Republican leader has since credited the deployment with cutting down rates of violence in the city.
     But data from the Metropolitan Police Department showed violent crime in Washington, DC, was already at a 30-year low, and critics warned that the crackdown could end up being a test run for the broader militarisation of US cities.
     Earlier this week, the top Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, said in an interview with CNN that Trump had “no authority” to send federal troops to Chicago.
     The US Constitution gives the power of policing to the states.
     JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, where Chicago is located, also rejected the idea.
     “Donald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he is causing working families,” Pritzker said in a statement.
     Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, CNN reported on Friday that the Trump administration has been preparing to carry out a “major immigration enforcement operation” in Chicago as early as next week.
     According to CNN, White House officials said those plans are separate from Trump’s idea of sending National Guard troops to Chicago for a broader crackdown on crime.
     The president, who took office in January for a second term, has pursued a hardline, anti-immigration agenda and pledged to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in US history.
     The administration has justified its push by saying it is deporting “criminals” who are in the US illegally. It has reached deals with third countries to take in deported asylum seekers and migrants.
     But US media reports over the past months have shown that many people have been swept up in the immigration raids, including some American citizens and permanent residents with no criminal records.
     In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles after an intensified wave of arrests by US immigration authorities prompted massive protests and confrontations between demonstrators and police.
     On Saturday, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson slammed the Chicago mayor’s executive order, saying in a statement shared by US media outlets that “cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue”.
     “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,” Jackson said.
     During his news conference, Johnson, the mayor, said it remained unclear whether Trump would go ahead with his plans in the city.
     “He could change his mind, he could reverse course – in fact, I encourage him to do that,” Johnson said, stressing that Chicago – the country’s third largest city – does not want its residents rounded up off the streets.
     “We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the backs of unmarked vans. We don’t want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents,” he added.

38) Palestinian Authority urges US to reinstate Abbas’s visa before UNGA — Al Jazeera (2025-08-30)

     Mahmoud Abbas’s spokesperson calls on countries to exert pressure on Washington before next month’s UN annual meetings.
     Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s office has urged the United States to reverse a decision to revoke the Palestinian leader’s visa, just weeks before he was set to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.
     The Palestinian presidency expressed “astonishment” at Washington’s decision on Friday to rescind the visas for Abbas and 80 other Palestinian officials before next month’s high-level meetings at UN headquarters.
     Abbas has addressed the General Assembly for many years and generally leads the Palestinian delegation.
     “We call upon the American administration to reverse its decision,” Abbas’s spokesperson spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh told The Associated Press on Saturday, warning that the move “will only increase tension and escalation”.
     “We have been in contact since yesterday with Arab and foreign countries, especially those directly concerned with this issue. This effort will continue around the clock,” Abu Rudeineh said.
     The spokesperson also urged other countries to put pressure on US President Donald Trump’s administration to reverse its decision, including most notably those that have organised a high-level conference about reviving the two-state solution.
     Set for September 22, the conference is being co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia.
     The Trump administration’s visa curbs come amid growing condemnation of Israel’s devastating war on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and a wave of Israeli settler and military violence in the occupied West Bank.
     The deadly attacks have prompted a growing number of countries to announce plans to recognise an independent Palestinian state at the UN in September.
     US Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the revocations on Friday by accusing the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of “not complying with their commitments” and “undermining the prospects for peace”.
     Rubio also accused the PA of taking part in “lawfare campaigns”, including appeals to the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court to hold Israeli accountable for abuses in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
     But Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, a US-based think tank, accused the Trump administration is “clearly violating diplomatic protocol” in its decision to revoke the visas.
     As a host state, the US is meant to grant visas to UN member-state representatives and officials to visit the international body’s headquarters in New York City.
     “What’s going on here is clearly ideologically driven,” Duss told Al Jazeera.
     “There are people inside the Trump administration who are working closely with the right-wing Israeli government and their goal is to simply remove the Palestinian liberation movement from the international agenda,” he said.
     “They do not recognise the Palestinian peoples’ right to state, and they’re both trying to prevent that on the ground in Palestine and now they’re trying to remove them from the international agenda in New York.”
     Meanwhile, the European Union’s foreign policy chief said the bloc is calling on Washington to reconsider its visa denials.
     “In the light of the existing agreements between the UN and its host state, we all urge for this decision to be reconsidered,” Kaja Kallas said on Saturday following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen.
     French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also said the General Assembly “cannot suffer any restrictions on access”.
     “The United Nations headquarters is a place of neutrality, a sanctuary dedicated to peace, where conflicts are resolved,” Barrot said.
     Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he spoke with Abbas on Saturday to express his “firm support” after the “unjust” visa revocations.
     “Palestine has the right to make its voice heard at the United Nations and in all international forums,” Sanchez wrote in a post on social media.

39) Iran arrests eight suspected of spying for Israel’s Mossad in 12-day war — Al Jazeera (2025-08-30)

     Revolutionary guards say suspects apprehended in northeastern Iran as materials for making weapons are also seized.
     Iran has arrested eight people suspected of attempting to transmit the coordinates of sensitive sites and details about senior military figures during the country’s 12-day war with Israel and the United States to the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, according to its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
     The IRGC released a statement on Saturday alleging that the suspects had received specialised training from Mossad via online platforms.
     It said they were apprehended in northeastern Iran before carrying out their plans, and that materials for making launchers, bombs, explosives and booby traps had been seized.
     The news comes as state media reported earlier this month that Iranian police had arrested as many as 21,000 “suspects” during the June conflict, though they did not say what these people had been suspected of doing.
     Following an Israeli military bombardment that began on June 13, killing top military officials and scientists as well as hundreds of civilians, Iran retaliated with barrages of missiles on Israeli military sites, infrastructure and cities.
     The US also carried out extensive strikes on Israel’s behalf on Iranian nuclear sites during the conflict, the worst blow to the Islamic republic since its 1980s war with Iraq.
     During the 12-day war, Iranian security forces began a campaign of widespread arrests accompanied by an intensified street presence based around checkpoints and “public reports”.
     Iranian citizens were called upon to report on any individuals they thought were acting suspiciously during the war that ended in a US and Qatar-brokered ceasefire.
     Iran has executed at least eight people in recent months, including nuclear scientist Rouzbeh Vadi, hanged on August 9 for passing information to Israel about another scientist who was killed in Israeli air strikes.
     Human rights groups say Iran uses espionage charges and fast-tracked executions as tools for broader political repression.
     The Israel-US-Iran conflict has also led to an accelerated rate of deportations for Afghan refugees and migrants believed to be illegally in Iran, with aid agencies reporting that local authorities have also accused some Afghan nationals of spying for Israel.
     “Law enforcement rounded up 2,774 illegal migrants and discovered 30 special security cases by examining their phones. [A total of] 261 suspects of espionage and 172 people accused of unauthorised filming were also arrested,” police spokesperson Saeed Montazerolmahdi said earlier this month.
     Montazerolmahdi did not specify how many of those arrested had since been released.
     He added that Iran’s police handled more than 5,700 cases of cybercrimes such as online fraud and unauthorised withdrawals during the war, which he said had turned “cyberspace into an important battlefront”.

40) Who can get updated COVID-19 vaccines in the US now? — Al Jazeera (2025-08-30)

     FDA has approved COVID shots for people aged 65+ and at high risk; others need a doctor’s order.
     By Madison Czopek | PolitiFact
     Winter is approaching in the United States and COVID-19 cases are rising. Questions about accessing protective vaccines are swirling.
     Nearly five years since the first US patient was vaccinated to help stem what was then a raging coronavirus pandemic, doctors, patients and pharmacists are navigating a radically different public health landscape.
     The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 27 announced it had approved some COVID-19 vaccines – but for far fewer people than in years past.
     If you tried to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine this week, your pharmacy’s online scheduler might have told you it isn’t available yet.
     Meanwhile, leading medical organisations disagree with the government’s latest COVID-19 vaccine guidance.
     If all that leaves you wondering about your ability to get a COVID-19 shot, you’re not alone. It’s confusing.
     We sought answers.
     First, what we do know: The FDA approved the 2025-26 vaccines for anyone age 65 and older and any person six months and older who has at least one underlying health condition that increases their risk of severe COVID-19 infection.
     So, people in those groups should be able to schedule vaccinations as soon as healthcare providers who are authorised to administer the vaccine receive it – likely in the next few weeks.
     Not “banned”, per se. But it may require more legwork on your end. You’ll need to consult your doctor, who can legally prescribe a COVID-19 vaccine for you even if you don’t fall within the categories the FDA specified.
     “Physicians can prescribe medications and vaccines that are beyond the label, beyond the licence,” said Dr William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University Medical Center professor of infectious diseases.
     That’s true for adults and children – and the practice of prescribing medications and vaccines for “off-label” use is fairly common in paediatrics, he said.
     If you’re in one of the two FDA-approved categories, the outlook is probably better than if you’re not.
     Federal law requires that most health insurance plans fully cover vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its vaccine advisory committee.
     Here’s the rub: Because the CDC hasn’t yet adopted 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, whether the shots will be covered by insurance is a grey area.
     The CDC’s panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP), had planned to vote on updated COVID-19 vaccine recommendations at its June meeting, but did not. And it’s unclear when or if the ACIP will vote on the recommendations.
     But there could be another avenue for people to get insurance-covered COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC’s vaccine recommendations typically include a provision for what’s known as “shared clinical decision making”, Schaffner said.
     That means, for example, “If you were 52 years old and otherwise healthy, but you nonetheless wanted to get the vaccine, you could discuss that with your doctor – shared clinical decision-making – and you could receive the vaccine, and insurance companies would honour that,” he said.
     That provision could be important for healthy people who want to avoid COVID-19 infection because they are close contacts with or care for people with high-risk conditions.
     But again, without CDC recommendations, “We don’t know if that provision is still there,” Schaffner said.
     To confirm whether your insurance will cover your COVID-19 shot, Schaffner recommends talking to your doctor and, potentially, your insurance provider. But first, give it a little more time: healthcare providers themselves are still working out the details.
     Vaccine manufacturers report that COVID-19 vaccines cost about $142, according to the CDC’s price lists. It’s unclear whether that would be the out-of-pocket cost for patients receiving a COVID-19 vaccine not covered by insurance.
     Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr in May announced he had unilaterally removed COVID-19 vaccines from the recommended immunisation schedule for healthy children and pregnant women. The health-focused news outlet STAT reported that no one from the CDC or ACIP was consulted before Kennedy announced this change. Vaccine experts called the move concerning and unprecedented.
     Removing the vaccines from the immunisation schedule could limit vaccine access by reducing insurance companies’ coverage of the shot. But again, by consulting with your doctor, you might still be able to access it. Some pharmacies also might be able to provide it, because the CDC lists pregnancy as a factor that increases the risk of severe COVID-19 infection.
     Broad health guidance always comes with exceptions. For example, people who have had “a very severe adverse reaction to a previous COVID-19 vaccine” should not get this season’s version, Schaffner said. You should discuss your health situation with your physician for personalised guidance.
     In short, Kennedy has long been broadly critical of vaccinations and, now that he’s in charge of the nation’s healthcare policy, has taken actions to overhaul their regulation and distribution.
     Typically, the CDC recommends vaccines based on guidance from ACIP. ACIP’s recommendations become CDC policy if they’re adopted by the CDC director. This year, Kennedy fired all 17 members of ACIP and replaced them with new members, many of whom have expressed anti-vaccine views. CDC Director Susan Monarez was fired on August 27 amid a dispute with Kennedy over vaccine policy.
     In previous years, the CDC recommended annual COVID-19 vaccines for everyone aged six months and older. The committee still hasn’t issued COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for this year.
     Yes. In recent months, professional organisations have issued their own recommendations that contradict new messaging from the federal government.
     The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine COVID-19 vaccines for all children aged six months to 23 months and for children aged two to 18 in some situations, including if they’re at high risk of COVID-19, have never been vaccinated against it or live in a household with people who are high risk.
     And the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that anyone pregnant or lactating receive updated or “booster” COVID-19 vaccines.
     Dr Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Disease Society of America, said the FDA’s decision to limit the COVID-19 vaccine’s approval “contradicts the evidence base, severely undermines trust in science-driven policy and dangerously limits vaccine access”.
     The FDA and HHS did not point us to a list of health conditions that meet the high-risk requirements.
     The CDC’s website catalogues a number of underlying conditions that it said demonstrate “a conclusive increase in risk for at least one severe COVID-19 outcome”. They included: chronic lung diseases, cancer, certain chronic kidney and liver diseases, diabetes, some disabilities, heart conditions, HIV, physical inactivity, primary immunodeficiencies and some mental health conditions.
     You’re right. These lists are inconsistent with the messaging coming from top HHS officials. Again, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant and lactating. Talk to your doctor.
     Yes. After the FDA passed its recommendations to vaccine manufacturers in May, the COVID-19 vaccines were updated to target the viral strain expected to circulate this year. The changes align with the World Health Organization’s recommendations.
     Since the FDA’s approval, updated vaccines are set to start shipping immediately and might even be available now in some pharmacies. Pfizer said it was shipping immediately and would be available across the US “in the coming days”. Sanofi, the company distributing the Novavax non-mRNA vaccines, said its vaccine should be available “in the early fall”.
     But what that means for how quickly you can access it could depend on where you live, your age and your health. (See next question.)
     We knew you were going to ask. And we wish we had a straightforward answer.
     If you typically get your COVID-19 shots at a local pharmacy, it might not be that easy this year.
     As of August 29, the scheduling apps for Walgreens and CVS notified patients in some locations that they could not schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment because of state restrictions, inventory or the need for a prescription.
     In 18 states and Washington, DC, pharmacists’ authority to administer vaccines is linked to the CDC’s recommendations, said Brigid Groves, the American Pharmacists Association’s vice president of professional affairs. The states are: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
     That means even though the FDA has issued its approval, in those 19 places, pharmacists cannot administer it because it isn’t on the CDC immunisation schedule yet, Groves said.
     The American Pharmacists Association has asked those states’ governors to issue executive orders granting pharmacists broader authority to administer vaccines.
     In the other 32 states, with some exceptions, it’s possible that a pharmacy can administer the updated COVID-19 shots for patients who fall within the FDA-approved categories of recipients.
     If you are getting it “off label”, however, because you don’t have one of those underlying conditions, you might need to get it straight from your prescribing doctor.
     One caveat: if ACIP votes on recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines that include giving them to healthy people through the “shared clinical decision making” process, Groves said pharmacists would be able to vaccinate almost anyone. That’s because pharmacists are considered clinicians who can conduct that shared decision-making.
     The committee has a September 18-19 meeting scheduled, according to the CDC’s website. A meeting agenda hasn’t been published yet.
     Typically, pharmacies ask patients to self-attest whether they have an underlying condition, Groves said. For example, a person who is under age 65 but has severe asthma would self-attest to that when making a vaccine appointment. So far, all signs point to that self-attestation still being the case.
     During fall and winter months, when COVID-19 infections are typically expected to spike alongside other respiratory infections.
     Kennedy recently cancelled $500m in funding for mRNA vaccine development . Two of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA. Some companies had been researching combined mRNA flu and COVID-19 shots, and those projects’ status is unclear.
     The FDA also recently announced that vaccine makers seeking approval for future COVID-19 vaccines, or boosters, would need to conduct new randomised clinical trials of healthy populations. That move, combined with the decision to narrow the FDA’s vaccine approval for certain segments of the population, is expected to limit COVID-19 vaccine access.

41) India will not ‘bow down’ to US after steep tariffs, trade minister says — Al Jazeera (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Analysts have warned that the 50 percent duty the US has imposed on Indian goods is akin to a trade embargo.
     India will not “bow down” to the United States and will instead turn its attention to attracting new markets, its trade minister has said, in his first public remarks since the US’s stiff 50 percent tariffs on Indian goods took effect.
     Speaking at a construction industry event in New Delhi on Friday, Piyush Goyal said India was “always ready if anyone wants to have a free trade agreement with us”. But, he added, India “will neither bow down nor ever appear weak”.
     “We will continue to move together and capture new markets.”
     The remarks came as the steep tariffs on many Indian imports into the US took effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its more than three-year war in Ukraine.
     Since his return to the White House this year, US President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
     The latest tariff salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
     Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
     Trump wants greater US access, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
     The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3bn.
     Analysts have cautioned that a 50 percent duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
     Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewellery have already reportedly cancelled US orders amid losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.
     Goyal said on Friday the government would release several measures in the coming days to support every sector and boost exports. “I can say with confidence that India’s exports this year will exceed 2024-25 numbers.”
     Meanwhile, days after the US tariffs on India went into effect, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, has largely upheld a May decision that found Trump overstepped his authority in imposing universal tariffs on all US trading partners.
     Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the move, claiming that trade deficits with other countries constituted a “national emergency”.
     But the appeals court questioned that logic in Friday’s decision, ruling overwhelmingly against the blanket tariffs.
     The Trump administration is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, and the appeals court therefore said his tariff policy could remain in place until October 14.

42) Russia, China blast deployment of US ‘Typhon’ missiles to Japan — Al Jazeera (2025-08-30)

     Moscow and Beijing said Japan must rethink its decision to allow even a temporary deployment of a US intermediate-range missile system.
     By Al Jazeera
     Russia and China have separately warned Japan over its decision to allow the United States to deploy “Typhon” intermediate-range missiles during joint military exercises in Japan next month, calling the move a threat to regional stability.
     “We view this as another destabilising step as part of Washington’s course toward ramping up the potential of ground-based shorter and intermediate-range missiles,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday.
     Deploying Typhon missiles “in regions near Russia poses a direct strategic threat to Russia”, Zakharova said in comments published by the country’s state-run TASS news agency.
     Moscow has also taken note of Japan’s moves towards “accelerated militarisation” and cooperation with the US, the spokeswoman said.
     If Japan does not rethink its decision on the Typhon’s deployment, Russia “will have to take appropriate military-technical measures”, she said.
     “We will assume that the entire responsibility for the further degradation of the situation in the region rests on the Japanese side,” she added.
     Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Friday that the US and Japan should contribute to regional peace and stability and not undermine it with the deployment of medium-range missiles, even if only temporarily.
     “China always opposes the United States deploying the Typhon Mid-Range Capability missile system in Asian countries,” Guo said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.
     “We urge Japan to take a hard look at its history of aggression, follow the path of peaceful development, act prudently in military and security areas, and refrain from further losing the trust of its Asian neighbours and the international community,” he said.
     Guo said China also called on Washington to “draw lessons from history and devote more effort and resources to doing the right thing rather than the other way around”.
     The Reuters news agency reports that the Typhon system is part of a drive by Washington to amass a variety of antiship weapons in Asia.
     That move already led to an earlier rebuke from China when the missiles were first deployed in the Philippines during a training exercise in 2024.
     Manila has since announced plans to buy the land-based US missile system, which has a range of some 480km (300 miles), though a longer-range version is currently being developed.
     A spokesperson for Japan’s Ground Self-Defence Force told Reuters the Typhon would be deployed to the US Marine Air Station in Iwakuni city, on Honshu island, some 890km (553 miles) west of Tokyo.
     It was unclear if Typhon missiles would be fired as part of the “Resolute Dragon” exercises between US and Japanese forces that run from September 11 to 25.

43) Amorim admits he sometimes ‘hates’ United players and some days ‘wants to quit’ — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Ruben Amorim admits his temperament means that on some days he “hates” his players and wants to quit and that on others he loves his squad and feels he would like to be Manchester United’s head coach for 20 years. Meanwhile, two of his forwards – Rasmus Højlund and Antony – neared the Old Trafford exit on Friday. Amorim offered the remarkable insight into his personality at the end of a week in which he stirred uncertainty over his future with comments made after his team lost at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. On Friday he said he intended to continue at United after the international break and thought he would do so but that he could not make any promises on his future. After the Grimsby game Amorim said “something has to change” and that “my players spoke really loud about what they want”. Asked about those remarks as he prepared for Saturday’s home game against Burnley, he expressed no regret. “Every time that we have in the future one defeat like that, I’m going to be like that,” he said. “I’m going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players. “This is my way of doing things and I’m going to be like that. In that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I’m not going to be like that.” Amorim believes United’s problems start in the players’ heads. “I feel the players are always thinking about the past,” he said. “They think there is something in the water here or in the food. It’s in our minds. We just need to think about the next game. We dropped a level [against Grimsby]. Now we have to respond in the next game.” After playing Burnley, United resume their season on 14 September at Manchester City. Amorim was asked whether he could confirm he would be in charge after the break. “I don’t know what is going to happen,” he said. “That is my idea. But again, I am not going to promise you anything – what is going to be the future. But I’m the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change.” The Portuguese said he understood how his post-Grimsby reaction had caused uncertainty regarding whether he would resign. “If you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that are good [from] that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin,” he said. “So I understand that. “And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years. Sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It’s going to be hard.” Asked whether anyone at the club tries to talk him out of moments when he feels the need to quit, Amorim said: “I just need 10 minutes with myself. I don’t need anyone.” After likening his extreme feelings for his players to those he has for his children, saying “sometimes I hate my kids”, he suggested improved results would make him less likely to “suffer”. “We just need to win some games and then things will be easier to do.” Amorim’s inflexible adherence to a 3-4-3 shape can draw criticism. He has said that formations do not matter so was asked, then, why he was unwilling to change. “If I feel it is best to change [I will],” he said. “We need to be so good in this way of playing and then we are going to adapt. When everyone is doing this with his eyes shut then we are going to do different things. This is the fun part.” United agreed a season-loan deal with Napoli for Højlund on Friday. The deal includes an obligation to buy worth €44m (£38m) if Napoli qualify for the Champions League. The player still needs to accept the move to the Serie A side and could stay in Manchester. The club also accepted a £25m bid for Antony from Real Betis, a huge loss on the Brazilian, who was signed on 1 September 2022 for £82m, though there is a 50% sell-on clause. As the Guardian reported this week, Kobbie Mainoo wishes to leave. But Amorim said he valued the midfielder. “I want Kobbie to stay,” he said. “He needs to fight for his place, and we need Kobbie. So that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing at this moment are disappointed. You have to fight during the week [in training].”

44) Shelton’s first career retirement and Tiafoe loss leave US men reeling at Open — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     It was a punishing Friday afternoon for American men’s tennis as Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe were bundled out of the US Open less than an hour apart, leaving only Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul still standing in the singles draw. Shelton, the No 6 seed and one of the leading contenders to end the United States’ 22-year wait for a men’s grand slam champion, was forced to retire from his third-round match against France’s Adrian Mannarino with a shoulder injury. It was the 22-year-old’s first career retirement, coming as he led by two sets to one before disaster struck late in the third. After landing heavily on his left arm while stretching for a ball, Shelton grimaced and told his father and coach, Bryan: “I did something to my shoulder. I don’t know what it is.” He later admitted the pain was “really high” and said: “I’ve never retired before. I’m not a guy who would retire if I could continue.” Despite a mid-set visit from the physio and a tactical switch that saw him attempt 13 serve-and-volley plays in the fourth set alone, he could not protect his advantage. Mannarino leveled the contest and, as the crowd braced for a decider, Shelton bowed his head on the changeover and called it off. The Frenchman advanced 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, ret. Shelton left Louis Armstrong Stadium with his shoulder wrapped in ice, a towel over his head and fighting back tears. Still, he struck a philosophical tone: “I was playing really well, I was in form, a lot of confidence … but I’ve got a lot to be grateful for. You won’t hear me pouting about how bad things are with the summer that I’ve had.” For the 37-year-old Mannarino, ranked 77th in the world, it was a bittersweet breakthrough: his first win over a top-10 opponent at a major in 23 attempts and his first appearance in the second week of the US Open. He will face the Czech No 20 seed, Jiri Lehecka, for a place in the quarter-finals. If that setback was not dispiriting enough for the home crowd, Tiafoe soon followed. The 17th seed, a semi-finalist in New York in two of the past three years, fell flat against German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff before an overflow crowd on the Grandstand court. The 35-year-old struck 14 aces and never allowed Tiafoe to find rhythm, closing out a 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (9) upset to reach the last 16 here for the first time. “I played extremely passive today. I didn’t put any pressure on him at all,” Tiafoe said. “It’s going to be hard to swallow how I played today and being out of the US Open this early. I haven’t been this down in a very, very long time.” He also bemoaned the quick conditions on Grandstand, saying he was “late on everything” and never found his timing. Struff, who had already toppled the No 11 seed Holger Rune, extended an unlikely run after failing to win a match at Flushing Meadows since 2020. His reward could be a fourth-round meeting with Novak Djokovic, who was due to face Cameron Norrie in Friday’s night session. For Tiafoe, it marked his earliest exit in New York since 2019. The American had not even realized Shelton had retired until told in his press conference. “That always sucks to go out like that,” he said. “Especially in a grand slam [in a match] where he was probably going to win.” The twin blows leave just two American men standing. Fritz, last year’s runner-up in Queens and a Wimbledon semi-finalist in July, was scheduled to play Swiss qualifier Jérôme Kym on Friday night. Paul, a 2023 Australian Open semi-finalist, had survived a five-set epic against Nuno Borges that ended in the early hours of the morning. Andy Roddick’s 2003 triumph remains the most recent men’s major title for an American. On a bruising afternoon in Queens, the odds of that drought coming to an end next week narrowed considerably.

45) Mother of boy, 15, held at gunpoint by US immigration agents files $1m claim — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The mother of a 15-year-old boy who was detained at gunpoint by federal immigration agents is seeking $1m in damages and accusing the Trump administration of false imprisonment and “unconstitutional racial profiling”. The teenager, a US citizen with disabilities, was in a vehicle with his mother outside Arleta high school in Los Angeles on 11 August when masked immigration agents surrounded them and pulled them from the vehicle. They said the boy was a suspect in a crime, and handcuffed him for several minutes until they realized they had the wrong person, the Los Angeles Times reported. His mother told NBC4 that the agent told her son they had confused him with someone else, but to “look at the bright side: you’re gonna have an exciting story to tell your friends when you go back to school”. “What’s exciting about getting guns pointed at you?” she said. The claim, filed by the Carrillo law firm on behalf of the boy and his mother, alleges that Ice and Border Patrol agents had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to detain the boy and caused him physical injury and emotional distress. He is traumatized and depressed, his mother said to media. The agents “racially profiled [the teen] while he was merely sitting his car waiting for his family member”, the claim states. It also alleges the agents left live bullet rounds on the scene in an act of “clear negligence”. The incident drew widespread outrage across Los Angeles, and fueled fears around the activities of immigration agents, particularly around city schools. Days earlier, authorities arrested an 18-year-old as he was walking his dog, shortly before he was set to start his senior year of high school. The Los Angeles Unified school district has moved to adopt new strategies to protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe, supportive spaces for all children and families – regardless of immigration status”. Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSD superintendent, has said the incident involving the 15-year-old was “unacceptable”. Immigration enforcement around schools “disrupts learning and creates anxiety that can last far beyond the school day”, Carvalho said in a statement earlier this month. In response to the 15-year-old’s detainment, Luz Rivas, a congressperson, condemned the administration’s “continued use of violent tactics to terrorize our students and families”. The claim was filed against the US Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection, US Customs and Border Protection and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security said allegations that agents targeted the high school were false and that agents were conducting a “targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien”. “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the US – NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists–truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities,” the statement said. The agency accused the law firm of trying to use“racial animus to collect clicks, clout, and cash”.

     Korean director Park Chan-wook’s new film brings his usual effortlessly fluent, steely confidence and a type of storytelling momentum that can accommodate all kinds of digressions, set-pieces and the occasional trance-like submission to mysterious visions. It starts out like an Ealing comedy-type caper then somehow morphs into something else: a portrait of family dysfunction, fragile masculinity and the breadwinner crisis, and the state of the nation itself. It is based on Donald E Westlake’s satirical horror-thriller The Ax from 1997, previously filmed in 2005 by Costa-Gavras, to whom this film is dedicated. It may not be Park’s masterpiece but it is the best film in the Venice competition so far. The scene is a perfect family home, where the man of the house, You Man-su (played by Korean star Lee Byung-hun), is benignly presiding over a late-summer barbecue in the garden, grilling some eels that have been given to him by the new American owners of the paper factory where he is employed. Adoringly looking on are his wife Miri (Son Ye-jin), her teen son from a previous marriage, their daughter (a cello prodigy), and their two lovely Labradors. But those eels are in fact a heartless and misjudged part of a job payoff; the new US masters are driving through brutal redundancies and Man-su is among them. He is devastated, but without the emotional language to express or understand how profound this loss is to him. He is fanatically desperate to reclaim his manhood in the eyes of his wife, children and pets by getting a new job in the paper industry within the three months before his severance pay runs out. But that is impossible, so a brilliant idea occurs to him. He sets up a phoney recruitment ad in a paper industry trade magazine, and with inspired cunning, Man-su makes it clear that, as the head of a paper firm committed to the product, he will on principle accept no online applications; they have to be on paper via the post, thus leaving no digital trail for the crime he intends to carry out. Using the personal information that these trusting applicants will send him, he will murder them all, thus creating a string of job vacancies in the cases of applicants who are in work, and, in the cases of the unemployed, a reduction in the amount of competition. When asked if he might try employment outside the paper industry, Man-su stubbornly says he has “no other choice”, while the American bosses say they had “no other choice” but to bring down the wage bill. Now he has “no other choice” but mass murder. At first, this film looks like a serial-killer comedy in the style of Kind Hearts and Coronets, or a salaryman-shame nightmare in the vein of Laurent Cantet’s Time Out and Nicole Garcia’s The Adversary. But in fact Park refuses our expectations: Man-su does not work through his victim-base as we might imagine. In fact, he stalls early on. Other narrative priorities come to the surface. We discover that the house, which he is in danger of losing due to mortgage default, was his childhood home, and the site of a profound trauma connected to his father, a pig farmer. (One of his victims gets trussed up as compactly as a pig: an unforgettably nasty image.) So all this might be only tangentially connected to his sacking. There are also subplots of family disarray, which loom out of the screen quite as importantly as the bizarre homicide campaign. Miri gets a job as a hygienist, assisting a dentist whom Man-su suspects has designs on her, and he instantly gets a psychosomatic toothache, which he naturally refuses to get treated; the thought of his wife’s suspected lover, assisted by his wife, bending over his open mouth is unthinkable. Then his son is accused of stealing mobile phones from a store owned by an obnoxious neighbour; and the son also witnesses his dad doing something strange in the greenhouse, which is to be the site of a sensationally weird dream sequence whose pure inexplicability seeps into the rest of the film. And throughout it all, a deadpan note of knockabout black comedy is never entirely absent. What on earth does it all mean? Some final, extraordinary images of hi-tech paper production and eco-devastation perhaps gesture at a meaning: mechanisation is coming, the algorithm is king, people are less important and our human intentions and human agency are descending into farcical irrelevance. • No Other Choice screened at the Venice film festival.

47) IDF declares famine-hit Gaza City a combat zone, ending ‘tactical pauses’ that allowed limited food delivery – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has declared Gaza City “a dangerous combat zone” as the military prepares for an assault on the shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. In a post on X, the IDF wrote: “In accordance with the situational assessment &amp; directives of the political echelon, starting today at 10:00, the local tactical pause in military activity will not apply to the area of Gaza City, which constitutes a dangerous combat zone.” The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department said in a statement on Friday. The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports. Israel’s foreign minister has hailed the US decision as a “bold step” on Friday. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said earlier this week that the evacuation of Gaza City is “inevitable”. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will launch its Gaza City assault while simultaneously pursuing a ceasefire, though talks have stalled. Israel has recovered the body of hostage Ilan Weiss from the Gaza Strip, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has confirmed. The body of a second person, whose identity has not yet been cleared for publication, was also retrieved, the statement added. At least 63,025 Palestinian people have been killed and 159,490 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. At least 59 Palestinian people, including 23 aid seekers, were killed in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. Israel targeted the Houthi group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior figures in airstrikes on Sanaa in Yemen on Thursday, and was still verifying the outcome, an Israeli military official said on Friday. Yemeni government sources told Reuters that Asaad al-Sharqabi, who oversaw the group’s defence ministry, was killed in the strikes. Gaza City is being gripped by famine caused by Israel’s restrictions on aid and the assault will only deepen the widespread suffering of the civilian population there and could forcibly displace an estimated one million Palestinian people. A joint statement from a number of UN organisations including Unicef and the World Food Programme said “it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist”. Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying they were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”, and denied the existence of a famine in Gaza. Mohammed Abu Afash, the director of the medical charity, the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, has told Al Jazeera that the southern part of the territory is extremely dangerous for civilians as the Israeli military is targeting areas it claims are safe zones. Afash told Al Jazeera that the army is targeting people who are waiting for food and residents sheltering in their homes, and that southern Gaza cannot accommodate the volume of people who will be displaced from Gaza City by Israel’s assault. More than 500 staff at the UN have urged its human rights chief, Volker Türk, to describe Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide being committed against the Palestinian people. In a letter to Türk, staff reportedly claimed that the legal criteria for genocide – which, under international law, is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group – has been met. The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. A spokesman for Gaza’s only Catholic church said some 440 people who have taken shelter there had unanimously agreed to stay, despite word that the IDF has declared Gaza City “a dangerous combat zone” and is preparing for an assault on the shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. Farid Jubran told The Associated Press on Friday that five clergy have also stayed in the church to assist those sheltering, which include women, children and older people. Israel’s foreign minister has hailed the US decision to deny Palestinian officials visas for next month’s UN general assembly, where France is leading a push to recognise a Palestinian state, as a “bold step” on Friday. “We thank [President Donald Trump] and the administration for this bold step and for standing by Israel once again,” Gideon Saar posted on his official X account. “Thank you [secretary of state Marco Rubio] for holding the “PLO” [Palestine Liberation Organization] and PA [Palestinian Authority] accountable for rewarding terrorism, incitement and efforts to use legal warfare against Israel,” he added. The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department said in a statement on Friday.

The director of the UN World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, said it is “very evident” there isn’t enough food in Gaza, adding that starvation was clearly under way in the territory. Her comments were made to the Associated Press during a visit to Gaza earlier this week and echo the declaration last Friday of widespread famine in Gaza made by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.

The Israeli military has expressed “its regret” after Lebanon’s army reported two of its soldiers were killed when an Israeli drone that crashed in the country’s south exploded. Lebanon’s army said its personnel were inspecting the drone that had fallen in the Naqura area on Thursday when it exploded, killing an officer and a soldier and wounding two others, according to a report from AFP. The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. Iranian oil minister Mohsen Paknejad said on Friday a return of sanctions under the so-called “snapback” may create restrictions on oil exports but Tehran has learned to bypass them, Iran’s state media reported. Britain, France and Germany on Thursday launched a 30-day process to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear programme, a step likely to stoke tensions two months after Israel and the United States bombed Iran. “We have faced restrictions on oil sales for years, and this has led to us gaining the necessary expertise in bypassing sanctions,” Paknejad told state media. “Naturally snapback may create conditions requiring new measures but we are not tied down by these restrictions.” The US denial of visas to Palestinian officials ahead of the UN general assembly meeting follow the imposition of sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July. In a statement, the state department said that “it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace.” Officials with the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, reject that they’ve undermined peace prospects, Reuters reports. Under the 1947 UN ‘headquarters agreement’ the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons. The state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate. An Israeli army position is set up along the fence separating the Gaza Strip from southern Israel, earlier today. The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department said in a statement on Friday. The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports. The move follows the imposition of US sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July, even as other Western powers moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood. In its statement, the state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate. Israel targeted the Houthi group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior figures in airstrikes on Sanaa in Yemen on Thursday, and was still verifying the outcome, an Israeli military official said on Friday. Yemeni government sources told Reuters that Asaad al-Sharqabi, who oversaw the group’s defence ministry, was killed in the strikes. They added that another Israeli raid targeted a military site frequented by the Houthis’ chief of staff, Muhammad Abd Al-Karim al-Ghamari. The Houthi group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Israeli military said fighter jets struck a compound in the Sanaa area where senior Houthi figures had gathered, describing the attack as a “complex operation” made possible by intelligence-gathering and air superiority. “We took advantage of an intelligence window of opportunity to carry out the strike and acted with precision and speed at the right moment,” a military official said in a statement. Hundreds of employees of the United Nations’ leading human rights agency have backed an internal letter telling its leadership to declare Israel’s offensive in Gaza a genocide and to call on UN member states to suspend arms sales to Israel. The 1,100-word letter, signed by about a quarter of the 2,000 staff of the Geneva- and New York-based Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), says the Israeli offensive in Gaza meets the legal threshold of genocide and that this means “arms sales, transfers and related logistical or financial support to Israeli authorities” constitutes a clear breach of international law by all those involved. OHCHR employees told the Guardian they were frustrated with the failure of agency’s head, Volker Türk, to “move beyond condemning Israel”. “The messaging has been the same for almost two years. Criticising Israel is not enough. He needs to be saying exactly what steps member states need to take to meet their obligations to prevent genocide and very firmly pointing out the legal consequences for leaders, officials and private businesses if they don’t,” said one staff member who signed the letter. Another praised Türk’s criticism of Israel for grave breaches of international law and apparent war crimes but charged that the decision to avoid clearer public statements about genocide was “a political not a legal choice”. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says that based on the “available evidence and authoritative assessments by the UN-appointed experts, as well as legal and [international humanitarian law] professionals, the legal threshold [for genocide] has been met. [We] therefore urge the Office to state the legal characterization publicly.” William Christou is a Beirut-based journalist The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. The approved resolution said Unifil would begin an “orderly and safe withdrawal” of its 10,800 peacekeepers from Lebanon in December 2026. The planned withdrawal will end the more than 47-year-long peacekeeping mission. Initially created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Unifil’s soldiers patrol the shared border between Israel and Lebanon. The force has been tasked with monitoring and reporting violations of the November ceasefire between Hezbollah and Lebanon, so the Lebanese army can enforce the terms of the agreement. You can read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from Gaza City: At least 63,025 Palestinian people have been killed and 159,490 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. At least 59 Palestinian people, including 23 aid seekers, were killed in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. In a post on Telegram, the health ministry wrote: A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the streets, as ambulances and civil defense crews are unable to reach them until now. Over the past 24 hours, hospitals in the Gaza Strip recorded five new deaths due to famine and malnutrition, including two children, the ministry said in a separate post. This brings the total number of Palestinian people who have died from famine and malnutrition to 322, including 121 children. Figures from the health ministry are generally seen as reliable by the UN and other international organisations. Mohammed Abu Qamar, 42, who is originally from the Jabalia camp in northern Gaza, is travelling to the south under threat from the expanded Israeli assault. “We don’t want to leave our home. We’re exhausted, driven north and south with no relief,” he told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency by telephone, adding that his “heart is burning”. “Death is closing in around us. We walk on the road, not knowing if we’ll reach safety or die halfway there.” Mohammed Abu Afash, the director of the medical charity, the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, has told Al Jazeera that the southern part of the territory is extremely dangerous for civilians as the Israeli military is targeting areas it claims are safe zones. Afash told Al Jazeera that the army is targeting people who are waiting for food and residents sheltering in their homes, and that southern Gaza cannot accommodate the volume of people who will be displaced from Gaza City by Israel’s assault.

Lebanon’s army said its personnel were inspecting the drone that had fallen in the Naqura area on Thursday when it exploded, killing an officer and a soldier and wounding two others, according to a report from AFP. The Israeli army’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee wrote on X that the military had on Thursday “attacked an engineering vehicle in the Naqura area in southern Lebanon that was preparing to rebuild Hezbollah military infrastructure in the area”. He added that during the raid, “a technical malfunction occurred” which meant the munition failed to explode and fell to the ground, “with subsequent reports indicating several Lebanese army casualties.” Adraee said an investigation was underway “to determine if the incident was caused by the explosion of Israeli weapons,” adding that the military “expresses its regret for the injury of Lebanese army soldiers”. Pro-Palestinian campaigners are preparing to set sail for Gaza from Spain on Sunday in dozens of boats and have called on governments to pressure Israel into allowing their flotilla to pass through a naval blockade. Greta Thunberg and is among hundreds of people from 44 counties due on the flotilla. In June, the Israeli navy boarded and seized a boat containing Thunberg that attempted to break the blockade. It is the last day of recess for the British parliament and, as MPs prepare to head back to Westminster, a reminder that the UK’s prime minister Keir Starmer said in July that the country will formally recognise the state of Palestine this September unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution in the Middle East. An official government statement issued on 29 July night said the UK would recognise Palestine at the UN general assembly unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire, makes it clear it will not annex the West Bank, and “takes substantive steps” to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza including by allowing the UN to supply aid. This effectively requires Israel to revive the prospect of a two-state solution, an idea that Benjamin Netanyahu has long rejected. Recognition is a symbolic step but one that would infuriate the Israeli government, which argues that it would encourage Hamas and reward terrorism. It is in effect a formal, political acknowledgment of Palestinian self-determination – without the need to engage in thorny practicalities such as the location of its borders or capital city. It also allows the establishment of full diplomatic relations. Israel has recovered the body of hostage Ilan Weiss from the Gaza Strip, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has confirmed. The body of a second person, whose identity has not yet been cleared for publication, was also retrieved, the statement added. In a tribute to Weiss, Israeli president Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X: 692 days after he was brutally kidnapped with his wife Shiri and their daughter Noga, Ilan’s body was recovered in a joint IDF and Shin Bet operation. A moment of deep sorrow, but also of closure. Ilan showed courage and noble spirit when he fought the terrorists on that dark day. In his death, he gave life. And ever since, his family has shown extraordinary strength in their struggle for his return. Gaza City is being gripped by famine caused by Israel’s restrictions on aid and the assault will only deepen the widespread suffering of the civilian population there and could forcibly displace an estimated one million Palestinian people. A joint statement from a number of UN organisations including Unicef and the World Food Programme said “it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist”. “Many people – especially sick and malnourished children, older people and people with disabilities – may be unable to evacuate,” it said. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said earlier this week that the evacuation of Gaza City is “inevitable”. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will launch its Gaza City assault while simultaneously pursuing a ceasefire, though talks have stalled. The Israeli prime minister has claimed the assault is the best way to weaken Hamas and return hostages, but many hostage families disagree and fear it will endanger hostages lives. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on southern Israel in 2023. Most hostages have been released during previous ceasefires. About 50 remain in Gaza, and Israeli officials believe about 20 are still alive. Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging ceasefire negotiations – and blocking their progress – to ensure his own political survival by having the war continue. The Israeli leader is on trial in Israel for alleged corruption and is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. He denies all the charges against him. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has declared Gaza City “a dangerous combat zone” as the military prepares for an assault on the shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. In a post on X, the IDF wrote: In accordance with the situational assessment &amp; directives of the political echelon, starting today at 10:00, the local tactical pause in military activity will not apply to the area of Gaza City, which constitutes a dangerous combat zone. The IDF continues supporting humanitarian efforts while conducting operations to protect Israel. Planes and tanks have reportedly been pounding parts of Gaza City over the past week and Israeli tanks and armored vehicles have been deployed to its outskirts. Around one million Palestinian people, many of whom are too frail or old to keep moving, are expected to be displaced by Israel’s expanded assault in the area, where a UN-backed food body declared earlier this month that a famine was taking place. More than 500 staff at the UN have urged its human rights chief, Volker Türk, to describe Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide being committed against the Palestinian people. In a letter to Türk, staff reportedly claimed that the legal criteria for genocide – which, under international law, is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group – has been met. In the letter, seen by the Reuters news agency and Al Jazeera, the UN staff said failure to describe Israel’s assault as a genocide “undermines” the UN’s credibility. It was reportedly signed by the Staff Committee on behalf of more than 500 employees at the Geneva-based office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR), and sent to Türk earlier this week. “OHCHR has a strong legal and moral responsibility to denounce acts of genocide,” said the letter, which called on Türk to take a “clear and public position”. “Failing to denounce an unfolding genocide undermines the credibility of the UN and the human rights system itself,” it added. It cited the international body’s perceived moral failure for not doing more to stop the 1994 Rwanda genocide that killed more than 1 million people. Turk has the full and unconditional support of the UN secretary general António Guterres, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, adding: “Labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal authority.” South Africa’s case against Israel at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) accusing the state of committing genocide is ongoing. Israel denies the charges. There has been a worsening in relations between Israel and the UK over recent months. The UK government said in July it would recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution in the Middle East, enraging the Israeli government. The UK has sanctioned far-right Israeli ministers and those who committed settler violence, and broken off trade negotiations with Israel over its military conduct in Gaza. But Keir Starmer’s government has been accused inside of the UK of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to the territory and killed over 62,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are women and children, according to officials. Despite Israel being accused of war crimes and of committing genocide in Gaza, the UK has still allowed arms sales to Israel and has run surveillance flights over Gaza with the help of a US contractor. Israel’s defence ministry has criticised the UK government for excluding its officials from a London arms fair next month, calling it an act of “discrimination”. A UK government spokesperson said earlier that no Israeli government delegation would be invited to attend the Defence &amp; Security Equipment International (DSEI) event, which will feature national delegations and private companies who showcase military equipment and weapons at London’s Excel centre. The spokesperson said the Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its assault in Gaza was wrong, in comments seemingly in reference to Israel’s plan to launch a massive new assault on Gaza City within weeks. “As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025,” the spokesperson said. “There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,” the spokesperson added. Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion at the trade show as it has done previously. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael, IAI and Uvision, will still be able to attend. “These restrictions amount to a deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination against Israel’s representatives. Accordingly, the Israel Ministry of Defence will withdraw from the exhibition and will not establish a national pavilion,” Israel’s defence ministry said in a statement. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this morning that Europe wants to find diplomatic solutions to the Iranian nuclear programme question. “We are entering a new phase with this 30 days that is now giving us also the opportunity to really find diplomatic ways to find a solution,” Kallas told journalists. “We have this 30 days to sort things out,” she added. Iran has been enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, a short step from the roughly 90% of bomb-grade, and had enough material enriched to that level, if refined further, for six nuclear weapons, before airstrikes by Israel (and then the US) were launched on Iranian nuclear sites in June, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. The west says the advancement of Iran’s nuclear programme goes beyond civilian needs, while Tehran says it wants nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. Patrick Wintour is diplomatic editor for the Guardian The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites or face deeper worldwide economic isolation. UK officials said the decision had not been taken lightly and there had been intensive diplomacy to try to avert this step. The officials emphasised there was still room for last-ditch diplomacy before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force in 30 days’ time. The annual high-level UN general assembly in September is likely to involve more intensive diplomacy over the situation with Iran. They added that Iran had been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity to become compliant but had either been unwilling or unable to act. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Iran after Israel bombed its key nuclear sites, and has been unable to renegotiate a return to assess the state of those sites. Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the Bushehr site, where refuelling is due to occur. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the decision by the three European countries in a call on Thursday morning. You can read the full story here: Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying they were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”, and denied the existence of a famine in Gaza. We mentioned the findings of the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in our opening post. Here is a bit more detail about the report which said last week that more than half a million people across Gaza are facing “catastrophic” conditions characterised by “starvation, destitution and death”. The IPC said an “entirely man-made” famine is happening in Gaza City, the territory’s largest, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month. Only four famines have been declared by the IPC since it was established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year. The IPC is a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report says. It continues: The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay – even by days – will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality. If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and (sanitation and water) services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially. We are restarting our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. The director of the UN World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, said it is “very evident” there isn’t enough food in Gaza, adding that starvation was clearly under way in the territory. Her comments were made to the Associated Press during a visit to Gaza earlier this week and echo the declaration last Friday of widespread famine in Gaza made by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. “I personally met mothers and children who were starving in Gaza,” McCain said. “It is real and it is happening now.” McCain said she spoke with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and claimed he is “concerned” about the issue. In the past, Netanyahu has denied the existence of famine in Gaza and said the claims about starvation are a propaganda campaign launched by Hamas and spread by the media. “We agreed that we must immediately redouble our efforts to get more humanitarian aid in. Access and security for our convoys is critical,” McCain said. Netanyahu has presided over a government that has been starving Gaza by limiting the amount of aid coming into the territory. Charities say there are ongoing obstructions in being able to collect and distribute aid. In March and April Gaza was under total siege, with no food entering. Israel justified what was widely seen as the collective punishment of the civilian population as a tactic to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. In mid-May Netanyahu said shipments would restart because of international pressure over a “starvation crisis”. But the amount of food and basic essentials let into the territory is still woefully inadequate and many Palestinian people have been killed while trying to collect aid. Stay with us as we give you the latest updates on Gaza throughout the day.

49) Step back and take it in: the US is entering full authoritarian mode | Jonathan Freedland — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     If this were happening somewhere else – in Latin America, say – how might it be reported? Having secured his grip on the capital, the president is now set to send troops to several rebel-held cities, claiming he is wanted there to restore order. The move follows raids on the homes of leading dissidents and comes as armed men seen as loyal to the president, many of them masked, continue to pluck people off the streets … Except this is happening in the United States of America and so we don’t quite talk about it that way. That’s not the only reason. It’s also because Donald Trump’s march towards authoritarianism is so steady, taking another step or two every day, that it’s easy to become inured to it: you can’t be in a state of shock permanently. And, besides, sober-minded people are wary of sounding hyperbolic or hysterical: their instinct is to play down rather than scream at the top of their voice. There’s something else, too. Trump’s dictator-like behaviour is so brazen, so blatant, that paradoxically, we discount it. It’s like being woken in the night by a burglar wearing a striped shirt and carrying a bag marked “Swag”: we would assume it was a joke or a stunt or otherwise unreal, rather than a genuine danger. So it is with Trump. We cannot quite believe what we are seeing. But here is what we are seeing. Trump has deployed the national guard on the streets of Washington DC, so that there are now 2,000 troops, heavily armed, patrolling the capital. The pretext is fighting crime, but violent crime in DC was at a 30-year low when he made his move. The president has warned that Chicago will be next, perhaps Baltimore too. In June he sent the national guard and the marines into Los Angeles to put down protests against his immigration policies, protests which the administration said amounted to an “insurrection”. Demonstrators were complaining about the masked men of Ice, the immigration agency that, thanks to Trump, now has a budget to match that of the world’s largest armies, snatching people from street corners or hauling them from their cars. Those cities are all run by Democrats and, not coincidentally, have large Black populations. They are potential centres of opposition to Trump’s rule and he wants them under his control. The constitution’s insistence that states have powers of their own and that the reach of the federal government should be limited – a principle that until recently was sacred to Republicans – can go hang. Control is the goal, amassing power in the hands of the president and removing or neutering any institution or person that could stand in his way. That is the guiding logic that explains Trump’s every action, large and small, including his wars on the media, the courts, the universities and the civil servants of the federal government. It helps explain why FBI agents last week mounted a 7am raid on the home and office of John Bolton, once Trump’s national security adviser and now one of his most vocal critics. And why the president hinted darkly that the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie is in his sights. It’s why he has broken all convention, and possibly US law, by attempting to remove Lisa Cook as a member of the board of the Federal Reserve on unproven charges of mortgage fraud. Those charges are based on information helpfully supplied by the Trump loyalist installed as federal housing director and who, according to the New York Times, has repeatedly leveraged “the powers of his office … to investigate or attack Mr Trump’s most recognisable political enemies”. The pattern is clear: Trump is using the institutions of government to hound his foes in a manner that recalls the worst of Richard Nixon – though where Nixon skulked in the shadows, Trump’s abuses are in plain sight. And all in the pursuit of ever more power. Take the firing of Cook. With falling poll numbers, especially on his handling of the economy, he craves the sugar rush of an interest rate cut. The independent central bank won’t give it to him, so he wants to push the Fed out of the way and grab the power to set interest rates himself. Note the justification offered by JD Vance this week, that Trump is “much better able to make those determinations” than “unelected bureaucrats” because he embodies the will of the people. The reasoning is pure authoritarianism, arguing that a core principle of the US constitution, the separation of powers, should be swept aside, because all legitimate authority resides in one man alone. Of course, the greatest check on Trump would come from the opposition winning power in a democratic election, specifically Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives in November 2026. Trump is working hard to make that impossible: witness this month’s unabashed gerrymander in Texas, where at Trump’s command, Republicans redrew congressional boundaries to give themselves five more safe seats in the House. Trump wants more states to follow Texas’s lead, because a Democratic-controlled House would have powers of scrutiny that he rightly fears. Meanwhile, apparently prompted by his meeting with Vladimir Putin, he is once again at war against postal voting, baselessly decrying it as fraudulent, while also demanding a new census that would exclude undocumented migrants – moves that will either help Republicans win in 2026 or else enable him to argue that a Democratic victory was illegitimate and should be overturned. In that same spirit, the Trump White House now argues that, in effect, only one party should be allowed to exercise power in the US. How else to read the words of key Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who this week told Fox News that “The Democrat party is not a political party; it is a domestic extremist organisation.” It’s the same picture on every front, whether it’s plans for a new military parade in Trump’s honour or the firing of health officials who insist on putting science ahead of political loyalty. He is bent on amassing power to himself and being seen to amass power to himself, even if that means departing from economic conservative orthodoxy to have the federal government take a stake in hitherto private companies. He wants to rule over every aspect of US life. As Trump himself said this week, “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” The former Obama adviser David Axelrod is not alone when he says, “We have gone from zero to Hungary faster than I ever imagined.” The trouble is, people still don’t talk about it the way they talk about Hungary, not inside the US and not outside it. That’s partly the It Can’t Happen Here mindset, partly a reluctance to accept a reality that would require, of foreign governments especially, a rethink of almost everything. If the US is on its way to autocracy, in a condition scholars might call “unconsolidated authoritarianism”, then that changes Britain’s entire strategic position, its place in the world, which for 80 years has been predicated on the notion of a west led by a stable, democratic US. The same goes for the EU. Far easier to carry on, either pretending that the transformation of the US is not, in fact, as severe as it is, or that normal service will resume shortly. But the world’s leaders, like US citizens, cannot ignore the evidence indefinitely. To adapt the title of that long-ago novel, it can happen here – and it is.

50) Hazel Fox obituary — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/29/hazel-fox-obituary
   Text:
     For a lawyer who specialised in the arcane area of law known as “state immunity”, Hazel Fox was a remarkably influential figure. Her chosen subject is increasingly the cause of courtroom and political clashes. Fox, who has died aged 96, was one of the foremost authorities documenting the interaction between domestic and international legislation as aggrieved parties attempt to sue foreign governments for alleged torture, murder or financial misdeeds. Her volume The Law of State Immunity, published in 2002 and already into its third edition (updated by her successor Prof Philippa Webb), analyses the cases through which the traditional, absolute freedoms enjoyed by states to engage in diplomatic relations have come under mounting pressure to give ground to other demands in an ever more interconnected world. Fox appeared in few cases. One was a 1988 high court libel hearing in which Mohamed Al Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, sued a Gulf state ambassador for accusing him of impersonating an official in order to gain access to the VIP lounge at Heathrow Airport and attempt to import “prohibited goods”. The court dismissed the case on the grounds of inviolability of diplomatic documents. Fox was also involved in a landmark torture claim brought against the Kuwaiti government in 1996 by Sulaiman Al-Adsani, a British national who had also been a member of the Kuwait air force. The judges in London dismissed the case due to state immunity. In the case of Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean former dictator arrested in London in 1998 under an extradition warrant to face human rights abuse charges in Spain, Fox was reported to have been consulted by one of the UK judges. Her lucid, explanatory talks recorded for the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs on state immunity are still available online. Fox was a legal blue blood: the stepdaughter of Lord Denning – the distinguished former master of the rolls – and wife of an appeal court judge. A sparky and dynamic presence, she moved in rarefied judicial and academic circles. She was born in the colonial hill station of Maymyo, near Mandalay, in what was then British-administered Burma. Her father, Jack Stuart, was the engineer responsible for dams, water control and bridges on the Irrawaddy River; her mother, Joan (nee Elliot-Taylor), loved painting. Hazel was the second of their three children. In the mid-1930s the family returned to England. Stuart advised on water irrigation in Palestine and Persia. Hazel was sent to board at Roedean, a girls’ school near Brighton. Along with the school she was evacuated to Keswick in the Lake District during the second world war. There she learned of her father’s sudden death in 1941, but continued lessons – not seeing her mother or siblings until weeks afterwards at the end of term. At a school drinks party for parents, Joan Stuart met the also recently widowed high court judge, Tom Denning; the couple married in 1945. Hazel, who was head girl at Roedean, went to Somerville College, Oxford, the following year to study modern languages. She did not enjoy the course and, with the help of her stepfather, switched to jurisprudence, graduating with a first in 1949. Moving to London, she joined chambers and in 1950 was called to the bar, where she practised for several years before marrying, in 1954, Michael Fox, a barrister who later became an appeal court judge. She began to research, publishing International Arbitration: Law and Procedure in 1959 with the Foreign Office official John Simpson. Her language skills had tilted her interests towards international law and enabled her to read foreign court reports. In the 1960s, Fox joined a group exploring legal records in the Foreign Office archives. Their investigations were published in the British Digest of International Law. While bringing up four children, she also served as a magistrate at Tower Hamlets juvenile court. In 1976, she returned to Oxford to teach law, later becoming chair of the London Rent Assessment Panel and the London Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. In 1982, she was appointed director of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL). She revitalised the institute through fundraising and partnerships with industry and other organisations, turning it into one of the most influential UK forums for debate on international law. She also pioneered legal agreements that enabled prospecting companies to exploit oil and gas offshore in areas where maritime boundary disputes remained unresolved. As general editor of the International and Comparative Law Quarterly, she was renowned as a tough editor, damning one book for being “a woolly diatribe”. Described by friends as “doughty” and a “formidable legal scholar”, she was the only member of a British legal delegation to post-Soviet eastern Europe to bring her bathing costume and insist on a dip in the Baltic. Her laughter, charm and good humour inspired loyalty and affection. She named one of her cats BIICL (pronounced “Bikle”) as a play on her professional duties. At one point she was a candidate to become the UK’s judge at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Fox returned to the bar in her 60s, appearing at the international court of justice in The Hague in a border dispute between Botswana and Namibia. She continued practising until her mid-80s. In 1993, she was appointed an honorary QC for her legal scholarship, and in 2006 made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for contributions to international law and diplomacy. Outside law, she loved gardening and reading. In later life she cared for her husband, whose final years were marred by blindness and Alzheimer’s disease. She is survived by her children, Matthew, Patrick, Jane and Charles, and nine grandchildren. • Hazel Mary Fox, barrister and legal author, born 22 October 1928; died 12 July 2025

51) Texas governor signs new redistricting bill, setting up loss of Democratic seats in US House — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/texas-governor-greg-abbott-signs-redistricting-bill
   Text:
     Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has signed a new redistricting bill that will redraw the state’s congressional map to heavily favor Republicans. On Friday, Abbott signed the highly controversial bill which prompted state Democrats to stage a weeks-long walkout earlier this month. In a video on X, Abbott can be seen signing the bill and says it “creates the one big, beautiful map that ensures fairer representation in the United States Congress for Texas”. Abbott’s signing comes after the Texas house of representatives approved the new map – which is set to create as many as five additional Republican congressional districts – on an 88-52 party line vote. The state senate then approved the bill early on Saturday. After the house’s approval, Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself. “Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing,” he added. The bill’s passage follows Trump’s request for the state to draw new congressional maps. Currently, 25 of Texas’s 38 districts have Republican majorities. The new redistricting will bring the Republican-favored districts to 30. The new districting plans will remove Democratic-majority districts in several major cities including Houston, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. The new map has drawn condemnation from Democrats as well as civil rights groups. In response to the passage of the map, Legal Defense Fund policy director Demetria McCain issued the following statement: “Black voters are not a tool for legislators to use to cut up maps as they see fit. This redistricting process in Texas is a shameful power grab at the expense of Black voices.” “Redistricting should be a sacred process, designed to empower voters in a transparent manner. The Texas leadership has instead made a mockery of our political process,” McCain added. California governor Gavin Newsom, who last week signed a redistricting proposal aimed at redrawing the state’s congressional boundaries in a direct response to the gerrymandered Texas maps, wrote on social media responding to Abbott: “Congratulations on your new position as Trump’s #1 lapdog, I know you worked hard for it!” The Democratic Governors Association released the following statement: “Republicans can’t defend their toxic and unpopular agenda of gutting health care for millions of Americans, so they’re trying to rig our elections before a single vote has even been cast. Democratic governors are on the frontlines of this fight – and they will use every tool available to stand up for their states and ensure fair representation.” Meanwhile, Oni Blair, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Texas chapter, said: “Before passing any disaster relief, Governor Abbott and his legislative allies redrew voting maps behind closed doors to further disenfranchise Black, Brown, and Asian American voters. “It’s disgraceful that Texas lawmakers chose to advance President Trump’s extreme agenda while turning their backs on the thousands of families still reeling from one of the deadliest floods in state history. Every Texan deserves fair representation – because in a democracy, voters pick their leaders, not the other way around,” Blair added. Texas Democratic party chair Kendall Scudder issued a statement following the signing: “With a stroke of the pen, Greg Abbott and the Republicans have effectively surrendered Texas to Washington, DC. They love to boast about how ‘Texas Tough’ they are, but when Donald Trump made one call, they bent over backwards to prioritize his politics over Texans. Honestly, it’s pathetic.” Scudder continued: “This isn’t over– we’ll see these clowns in court. We aren’t done fighting against these racially discriminatory maps, and fully expect the letter of the law to prevail over these sycophantic Republican politicians who think the rules don’t apply to them.”

52) EU accuses Putin of undermining peace talks after deadly strikes on Kyiv — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/eu-accuses-putin-of-undermining-peace-talks-after-deadly-strikes-on-kyiv
   Text:
     European leaders have accused Vladimir Putin of undermining peace talks, after Russian missile strikes on Kyiv this week killed at least 23 people and damaged diplomatic buildings, including EU and British Council offices. A day of mourning was observed in Kyiv on Friday, after the Russian air attack the day before that killed 23 people, including at least four children. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said eight people were still missing and 53 had been injured. “When instead of diplomacy, Russia chooses ballistics … the world must respond accordingly,” he said, urging western allies to impose further sanctions. Separately, the Ukrainian leader said Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk. “There is a buildup and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions,” Zelenskyy said. Europe’s high representative for foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas, responding to the attacks on Kyiv, issued a statement accusing Russia of disregard for international law and of undermining peace efforts. “Intentional attacks against civilians and non-military objectives are war crimes,” he said. “These crimes only reinforce our determination and resolve to support Ukraine and its people in their defence against Russia and their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.” The statement was endorsed by the UK and all EU member states except Hungary, which is led by Putin’s ally Viktor Orbán, who has long denigrated Ukraine and sought to block EU aid to the country. The latest attacks on the Ukrainian capital were the deadliest since Donald Trump met Putin in Alaska for an inconclusive summit, where he laid out the red carpet for the Russian leader, who has been indicted for war crimes. Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness, the Kremlin has held back. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Putin would have “played” Trump if he refused to meet Zelenskyy. After Macron hosted the German leader, Friedrich Merz, in the south of France, France and Germany pledged to increase air defence to Ukraine. In a joint statement, the key EU countries said: “Despite intensive international diplomatic efforts, Russia shows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine.” Kallas said the latest attacks showed “that Putin is just mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made. So what we have to do is increase pressure on Russia and this is really what they understand.” After the deadly strike in the early hours of Thursday morning, the EU has vowed to introduce a further round of sanctions against Russia – the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in 2022 – increase military aid for Ukraine, and discuss seizing €210bn of Russian assets frozen in the bloc. Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said hopes of peace negotiations were “at least naive” and Putin was “cheaply buying time to kill more people”. She praised efforts to secure peace, saying that “nobody [had] thought of anything better than [what] Washington is doing”. Colm McGivern, the director of the British Council in Ukraine, said Thursday’s airstrikes had injured a security guard and made the cultural organisation’s Kyiv headquarters “unusable”. While there is no evidence the council was deliberately targeted, McGivern said, “what I do know is that Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”. A neighbouring building in the city centre was struck at 5.40am and the blast-wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows, destroyed its ceilings and wrecked its computers, the director said. McGivern said that the 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had vowed to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities. “It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. “There is a palpable level of anger, and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can, to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK.” EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen discussed security guarantees for Ukraine, amid US pressure on European allies to shoulder more responsibility for the security of the continent. Kallas wants to reorganise an EU troop-training mission so Ukrainian soldiers could receive instruction inside Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The EU has said about 80,000 Ukrainian troops have taken part in the training programme since 2022. The latest Russian attacks have intensified calls to use Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin and to help Ukraine in its defence. Šakalienė expressed support for seizing Russia’s frozen assets and giving them to Ukraine, saying they would be “extremely helpful” for Ukraine’s defence industry and “very good motivation for Putin to sit at the negotiations table”. The EU has an agreement to use the windfall profits on Russian assets for Ukraine but has balked at seizing the capital, which is mostly held at Euroclear in Belgium, fearing weakening investor confidence in eurozone financial institutions. EU foreign ministers are to discuss using Russia’s frozen assets at a separate meeting with Kallas on Saturday. After the attacks on Thursday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU was “advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets to contribute to Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction”. A spokesperson later said she was referring to use of the profits, which have generated €9bn in funds for Ukraine in 2025, rather than the assets.

53) Solskjær, Mourinho and a warning for Amorim after Manchester United | Football Daily — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     UNITED WE FALL The modern football manager might wear classic Reeboks, or knackered Converse, or trackie bottoms tucked in socks but, to continue paraphrasing the Arctic Monkeys song, there ain’t no romance in our game no more. Nothing endures. The average managerial tenure tends to last between 18 months and two years. For Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Besiktas, it was a little more than seven months; José Mourinho got 14 at Fenerbahce. And so the pair, intrinsically linked by their sequential spells at Manchester United, find themselves on similar paths again, their sackings from Turkish nearly-clubs coming within hours of each other this week. Both have been caught in the meat grinder of Uefa’s endless European qualifiers. Solskjær’s brave Besiktas boys were downed by Ineos-owned Lausanne in the Tin Pot playoffs on Thursday night. A day earlier, Mourinho’s men were ousted by Benfica in the Bigger Cup equivalent. It feels rather timely that these two former United bosses should be chucked through the door marked Do One just as the latest man to suffer the Old Trafford meme factory is put to his limits. Ruben Amorim will rue the day he popped into Sports Direct to buy that magnetic tactics board, for it was instantly imbibed into the internet’s collection of looped two-second videos for merciless and eternal social media use. Amorim, the sweet-talking dogmatist whose principled management was the exact reason for his appointment at United, is now being viewed with ridicule and derision, just as Solskjær and Mourinho were before him. It comes for everyone. Solskjær was a club legend who ended his reign by crying on MUTV; Mourinho was the managerial great living miserably in a hotel room after alienating his squad. The scythe’s swing is remorseless. The United fanbase has always been divided regarding how to view the aforementioned duo. Without question, they occupy the top two in the post-Ferguson cartel of managers, albeit Erik ten Hag and Louis van Gaal won domestic cups where Solskjær won none. But the Norwegian came second, produced fluent football and endeared himself to United supporters. The romanticists loved him, how he paid lip service to the club’s history by playing counterattacking football and refusing to use Sir Alex Ferguson’s old parking space. It is widely agreed that sacking Solskjær in November 2022 was a premature move by United, given they had no idea how to replace him. There are now even some whispers among supporters about bringing him back. You know the drill: an interim spell, 4-2-3-1 and good vibes. Isn’t that what football is about? Oh no, sorry, romance is dead … Instead United and Amorim plough on together. The dreaded vote of confidence. The rigid formation. Mason Mount at left wing-back. The apologies from Diogo Dalot after another defensive disasterclass. There are rumours Amorim may be considering walking away from it all, shunning a hefty payoff, believing there is a desert island somewhere for him to sit on and fiddle with his laminated tactics tablet forever more. As Solskjær and Mourinho prove, however, the most likely future awaiting Amorim is a bleak spell managing Trabzonspor, eventually getting the bullet in late August 2028 for a meek Big Vase qualifying defeat to Lens.

54) Pentagon to restore Confederate general portrait at West Point library — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/robert-e-lee-west-point-portrait-confederate
   Text:
     A controversial portrait of General Robert E Lee, which shows an enslaved man holding the Confederate leader’s horse, is being returned to the library at West Point, according to Pentagon officials who spoke with the New York Times. The nearly 20ft canvas, which had hung in the US military academy since 1952, was removed following a 2020 law that ordered Confederate names and tributes to be stripped from military installations. That same law established a commission to rename bases and review monuments. By 2022, the commission directed West Point to clear away all items that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy”. Shortly after, the Lee portrait was taken down and placed in storage. Exactly how the painting is being reinstalled without countering the legislation remains uncertain. The measure was passed in the wake of nationwide demonstrations after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police. “At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place,” Rebecca Hodson, the army’s communications director, told the Times. “Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it – we don’t erase it.” Donald Trump has long framed the renaming of bases as an attack on American traditions. “Robert E Lee is considered by many Generals to be the greatest strategist of them all,” the president has said, adding that “except for Gettysburg” he thinks Lee would have won the civil war. Both Trump and the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have pushed for the restoration of Confederate symbols that were removed in recent years. Hegseth, in particular, has pressed for reinstating a Confederate memorial at Arlington national cemetery that Congress recommended removing. In an August social media post, he wrote that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings”. Hegseth moved to reinstate Confederate general names at army bases such as Fort Bragg and Fort Lee earlier this summer, but did so in a way that attempted to stay within the boundaries of the 2020 law. The new names honored different soldiers, none of whom had fought for the Confederacy, yet the names were the same as those of the original Confederate honorees. The Lee portrait had originally been installed at West Point during the early 1950s, part of a broader, mid-20th-century push to recast Lee as a celebrated figure in military history. West Point library did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.

55) Man believed dead in ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ is alive as Ice moves him without notice — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/florida-alligator-alcatraz-immigration-velasquez
   Text:
     A man whose loved ones thought he had died at Florida’s Alligator Alcatraz after alleged delays in appropriate medical care turned out to be alive and was then secretly moved to the immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss, Texas – and has since been moved again. Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez is awaiting deportation in what his lawyers said he described as a “living hell”. Rivas Velásquez, 38, had already signed an agreement to be deported after becoming desperate in detention and feeling worn down in his efforts to be granted asylum in the US amid Donald Trump’s anti-immigration efforts. “All that Luis wants desperately is to get out of detention, even if that means being deported to Venezuela,” said Becca Sheff, senior staff attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Mexico. “That’s what it’s come down to for him and for so many others.” Instead, Rivas Velásquez was flown to the new Camp East Montana Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility housed at the US military base of Fort Bliss, apparently without the knowledge of his family or attorneys. Then it emerged that he has since been transferred again to an Ice processing center in nearby El Paso, where details of the conditions and his current circumstances were unclear. Attorney Eric Lee, at Lee &amp; Godshall-Bennett, who is representing him, described Rivas Velásquez’s treatment as “enforced disappearance” and said he considered his client’s constant moves from one facility to another as retribution for denouncing conditions for detainees and seeking legal redress. “He has described [himself and others] being treated like animals, in unbearable conditions,” Lee said. He added that Rivas Velásquez had described conditions in Alligator Alcatraz in the Florida Everglades as a “nightmare” and a “living hell” and that Fort Bliss was “just as bad”. The first his lawyer or his loved ones knew of his being moved to Texas was when Lee received a brief call from Rivas Velásquez. Before being first detained in Florida in July, Rivas Velásquez was a media influencer living in Miami and known to his social media followers as Luis Frio. He was confined at the camp in south Florida that was recently opened by the state and has been holding people on behalf of Ice, championed by Trump. Earlier this month, it was ordered closed by a judge within 60 days and the authorities are now swiftly moving people out. It has attracted waves of criticism for harsh conditions by design, alleged abuse of detainees, denial of due process as the men locked up there await deportation and environmental harm. Earlier this month, Rivas Velásquez had collapsed, unconscious, on the floor at the Florida camp, and Sheff said that guards were apparently slow and appeared not to know the best way to help him. It was another detainee, a nurse from Cuba, who provided CPR before the Venezuelan was taken to a Miami hospital and diagnosed with a respiratory infection, both attorneys said. The Florida division of emergency management did not respond to a request for comment before publication. “His family did not know if he was dead or alive. His attorneys could not get a hold of him,” Sheff said. Loved ones posted on social media that they believed he had died. His girlfriend, Rosana Navas, posted a tearful message from Miami that, translated from Spanish, said in part: “He died at Alligator Alcatraz due to the negligence of the United States government. He asked for medical attention, but they didn’t give it to him. He was covered in sores. He ate only once a day. We just need someone to help us transport his body … his family is in Venezuela, distraught.” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of Ice, issued a statement that Rivas Velásquez had fainted and “was taken to the hospital out of precaution”. The statement added that: “All detainees at Alligator Alcatraz have access to proper medical care” and that Ice takes its commitment to protecting those in its custody “very seriously”. At the time, Lee was convinced there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 at the facility, which the authorities have not confirmed. He has filed a legal complaint and joined a class-action lawsuit against the facility about conditions there. McLaughlin also said that Rivas Velásquez had “a rap sheet that includes an arrest for robbery in Miami”. Lee said the charges stem from a fight that Rivas Velásquez had with his girlfriend, Navas, during which he took her phone. He said his client did not have any other criminal history in the US. He had entered the US legally via the El Paso port of entry last year, having received an appointment with the US immigration authorities after applying via the CBP One mobile phone app. Trump shut down the scheduling and pre-screening app on the first day of his second term as US president this January and then changed it to a tool where immigrants could request removal from the US. The administration now increasingly regards many people who have been living in the US legally as suddenly illegal. Sheff said the Fort Bliss facility had mostly immigrants from Venezuela, Vietnam, Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba who have been transferred from other jails. The ACLU tried to visit Rivas Velásquez there but said it was denied access. “There are people who are still fighting their cases [to stay in the US] in immigration courts, who have not been ordered to be deported,” she added. Melissa Lopez, the executive director of local advocacy group Estrella del Paso, estimates that half of the 1,000 detainees at Camp East Montana “have had some kind of run-in with the criminal justice system” but said that could be as minor as having a traffic ticket. Organizations that have been calling for the facility at Fort Bliss to be shut down complain that detainees at the camp have been limited to receiving phone-only legal consultations, which are not private and sometimes denied. Lee said communications with Rivas Velásquez at Camp East Montana had been often inaudible, one-minute phone calls with a poor connection. “He called in a panic, explaining that he had been denied access to necessary blood pressure and anxiety medication. He said he has not even been allowed to change his clothes in five days,” Lee said last weekend. “Before we could ask additional questions, the call was abruptly terminated.” Later, Lee learned that his client had then been moved from the military base and was now being held at an Ice processing center. McLaughlin said in a statement last week: “The Fort Bliss facility will offer everything a traditional Ice detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs.” The Ice office in El Paso did not respond to a request for further comment. Lee said the situation was not fair. “All Mr Rivas Velásquez wants is to be deported, yet the government continues to detain him at the taxpayers’ expense,” Lee said, arguing that his client’s case was another example of the federal government “going out of its way to prevent access to counsel for detained foreign nationals”.

56) UN human rights staff urge leadership to declare Israel’s war in Gaza a genocide — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Hundreds of employees of the United Nations’ leading human rights agency have backed an internal letter telling its leadership to declare Israel’s offensive in Gaza a genocide and to call on UN member states to suspend arms sales to Israel. The 1,100-word letter, signed by about a quarter of the 2,000 staff of the Geneva- and New York-based Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), says the Israeli offensive in Gaza meets the legal threshold of genocide and that this means “arms sales, transfers and related logistical or financial support to Israeli authorities” constitutes a clear breach of international law by all those involved. OHCHR employees told the Guardian they were frustrated with the failure of agency’s head, Volker Türk, to “move beyond condemning Israel”. “The messaging has been the same for almost two years. Criticising Israel is not enough. He needs to be saying exactly what steps member states need to take to meet their obligations to prevent genocide and very firmly pointing out the legal consequences for leaders, officials and private businesses if they don’t,” said one staff member who signed the letter. Another praised Türk’s criticism of Israel for grave breaches of international law and apparent war crimes but charged that the decision to avoid clearer public statements about genocide was “a political not a legal choice”. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says that based on the “available evidence and authoritative assessments by the UN-appointed experts, as well as legal and [international humanitarian law] professionals, the legal threshold [for genocide] has been met. [We] therefore urge the Office to state the legal characterization publicly.” The OHCHR “has a strong legal and moral responsibility to denounce acts of genocide” and that “failing to denounce an unfolding genocide undermines the credibility of the UN and the human rights system itself”, the letter adds. UN officials have said that only an international court can declare a genocide – a process that can take many years. Experts on the international court of justice (ICJ) said in July that a judgment on whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza was unlikely before the end of 2027 at the earliest. Many international human rights groups have already said a genocide is under way in Gaza, where the Israeli offensive has killed more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians, injured 150,000 and displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population. UN-backed experts declared a famine in parts of the devastated territory earlier this month. Israeli officials reject the charge of genocide as “outrageous and false”, and say the country is acting in self-defence after Hamas’s surprise raid in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in 251 hostages being taken. In January last year, the ICJ ruled that the claim of genocide was “plausible” and ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power” to stop acts of genocide, and incitement to genocide from being committed and take “immediate and effective measures” to allow aid into Gaza. One OHCHR employee said Türk was failing his mandate to prevent as well as report human rights abuses around the world and that his high-profile post offered an opportunity to make a much greater difference. “People take notice of what we say, and he says. He could be telling member states and officials working for them that they could face really serious legal consequences. At least that would make them think and put down a marker. No one could claim later that they didn’t know,” said one signatory to the letter. In his response to the letter, also seen by the Guardian, Türk said signatories had raised “important concerns” and pledged to continue to “demand accountability regarding arms transfers facilitating violations”. “I know we all share a feeling of moral indignation at the horrors we are witnessing, as well as frustration in the face of the international community’s inability to bring this situation to an end,” wrote Türk, a human rights lawyer and veteran UN official, . A spokesperson for the OHCHR said the agency had been working in very difficult circumstances “in the face of vilification and accusations of bias, complicity, antisemitism, double standards and more” to try to document the facts on the ground and raise the alarm. The spokesperson added that Türk had warned repeatedly of the “high and increasing risk that atrocity crimes”, which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, “are being committed in the occupied Palestinian territory”. In November, Türk called on UN member states to assess arms sales or transfers to Israel and any other actors in the conflict, “with a view to ending such support if this risks serious violations of international law.” “As the high commissioner has said, since 7 October 2023, parties to this conflict have paid little heed to international law that protects human rights and governs the conduct of hostilities. This has been a stain on the collective conscience of humanity … The international community needs to come together to bring this unbearable horror to an end,” the spokesperson said. Israel’s foreign ministry told Reuters it did not respond to internal UN employees’ letters “even if they are false, baseless, and blinded by obsessive hatred towards Israel”.

57) UN to end Lebanon peacekeeping mission next year after Israeli and US pressure — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/un-unifil-lebanon-peacekeeping-mission-withdrawal
   Text:
     The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. The approved resolution said Unifil would begin an “orderly and safe withdrawal” of its 10,800 peacekeepers from Lebanon in December 2026. The planned withdrawal will end the more than 47-year-long peacekeeping mission. Initially created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Unifil’s soldiers patrol the shared border between Israel and Lebanon. The force has been tasked with monitoring and reporting violations of the November ceasefire between Hezbollah and Lebanon, so the Lebanese army can enforce the terms of the agreement. Thursday’s UN resolution said it aimed to make the Lebanese government “the sole provider of security” in south Lebanon, and called for Israel to withdraw its forces. Israel has continued to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon and carry out hundreds of airstrikes in violation of the ceasefire, which it said were done to prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding its military infrastructure. The vote came after months of pressure by the Israeli and US governments, who have made ending the Unifil mission a priority. After the vote, the US ambassador to the UN, Dorothy Shea, said it was the last time the US would extend the Unifil mission. “The United States notes that the first ‘i’ in Unifil stands for ‘interim’. The time has come for Unifil’s mission to end,” she said. The decision was also praised by the Israeli representative to the UN, Danny Danon, who said: “For a change, we have some good news coming from the UN.” Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the US has moved closer to Israel’s position on Unifil. Israel has long considered Unifil to provide political cover to Hezbollah by failing to adequately disarm the militia in southern Lebanon since the end of the 2006 war, and has pushed for the mission to be disbanded. Israel attacked Unifil positions throughout the war with Hezbollah, injuring peacekeepers as a result. Unifil’s mandate means it is only a monitoring force and cannot use force except in self-defence. Instead, violations are reported to the Lebanese army, which is leading the disarmament of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Peacekeepers have also come under pressure from Hezbollah, with residents loyal to the group in south Lebanon frequently stopping patrols, throwing stones at military vehicles and on one occasion, slapping a peacekeeper. The Lebanese state has relied on Unifil to help create a buffer with Israel and support its under-equipped army to reassert state control over south Lebanon. The prime minister, Nawaf Salam, praised the UN resolution, saying it “reiterates the call for Israel to withdraw its forces from the five sites it continues to occupy, and affirms the necessity of extending state authority over all its territory”. Other nations involved, such as France and Italy, objected to the eventual withdrawal of peacekeepers, saying it could hamstring the Lebanese army’s ability to establish itself in south Lebanon. The army will next week present a plan to disarm Hezbollah. It wants to do so in a way that does not provoke a confrontation with the well-armed group and preserves civil peace in Lebanon.

58) Trump nixes $679m in funding for offshore wind farms amid fossil fuel push — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

     The cancellation is Trump’s latest move against renewable energy, which the US president has dismissed a ‘scam’.
     The administration of United States President Donald Trump has moved to cancel $679m in federal funding for offshore wind projects, in its latest salvo against renewable energy .
     The move on Friday is set to affect 12 offshore projects, including a $427m project in California, as Trump pushes to deregulate and re-prioritise fossil fuels .
     In a statement, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the funding was a waste of money “that could otherwise go towards revitalising America’s maritime industry”.
     “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritising real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said.
     The funding had been awarded under the administration of former President Joe Biden as part of a wider pivot towards green energy.
     Among the cancellations was funding for The Humboldt Bay project, which was meant to be the first offshore wind terminal on the Pacific coast.
     A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has emerged as a leading state opponent to Trump, criticised the action as an example of the administration “assaulting clean energy and infrastructure projects – hurting business and killing jobs in rural areas, and ceding our economic future to China”.
     The cuts include a $47m grant for an offshore wind logistics and manufacturing hub near the Port of Baltimore in Maryland, as well as $48m awarded in 2022 for an offshore wind terminal project near New York’s Staten Island.
     Also cut was $33m for a port project in Salem, Massachusetts, to redevelop a vacant industrial facility for offshore wind projects.
     In a statement, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey said cancelling the Salem grant will cost 800 construction workers their jobs.
     “The real waste here is the Trump administration cancelling tens of millions of dollars for a project that is already under way to increase our energy supply,” she said.
     The latest trimming comes after the Trump administration abruptly halted construction of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Department of the Interior said the move was necessary to address national security concerns, without providing further details.
     In early August, the Interior Department also cancelled a major wind farm in Idaho, which had been approved in the final days of Biden’s presidency.
     Multiple federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy and Commerce, said they are reviewing offshore wind farms approved by the Biden administration along the Atlantic coast.
     Trump has regularly lashed out at green energy, and particularly wind power, calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.
     Yet, foreign allies and rivals alike have increasingly embraced renewable energy in an effort to slow the ravages of climate change. China, for instance, has invested heavily in solar and wind energy and has become a leading source for wind turbine parts.
     Critics have said Trump’s approach will set the US back behind its competitors.
     Last week, as US electricity prices rose at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump falsely blamed renewable power for the skyrocketing prices, calling the industry a “scam”.
     On Tuesday, he pledged not to move forward with any wind power projects.
     “We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a cabinet meeting.

59) US appeals court rules Trump’s foreign tariff campaign is largely illegal — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     But the court has allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the Trump administration appeals to the Supreme Court.
     A United States appeals court has declared President Donald Trump’s blanket tariff policy illegal, but it stopped short of pausing the wide-ranging import taxes altogether.
     On Friday, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, largely upheld a decision in May that found Trump had overstepped his authority in imposing universal tariffs on all US trading partners.
     Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the move, claiming that trade deficits with other countries constituted a “national emergency”.
     But the appeals court questioned that logic in Friday’s ruling, ruling seven to four against the blanket tariffs.
     “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency,” the court wrote.
     “But none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.”
     The Trump administration is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, and the appeals court therefore said his tariff policy could remain in place until October 14.
     That was a departure from the May ruling, which included an injunction to immediately halt the tariffs from taking effect.
     The initial May decision was rendered by the New York-based US Court of International Trade, a specialised court that looks exclusively at civil actions pertaining to cross-border trade.
     That case was one of at least eight challenges against Trump’s sweeping tariff policies.
     Trump has long maintained that the US’s trading partners have taken advantage of the world’s largest economy, and he has depicted trade deficits – when the US imports more than it exports – as an existential threat to the economy.
     But experts have warned that trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing: They could be a sign of a strong consumer base, or the result of differences in currency values.
     Still, on April 2, Trump invoked the IEEPA to impose 10-percent tariffs on all countries, plus individualised “reciprocal” tariffs on specific trading partners.
     He called the occasion “ Liberation Day “, but critics noted that the global markets responded to the tariff announcements by stumbling downward.
     A few days later, as the “reciprocal” tariffs were slated to take effect, the Trump administration announced a pause for nearly every country, save China. In the meantime, Trump and his officials said they would seek to negotiate trade deals with global partners.
     A new slate of individualised, country-specific tariffs was unveiled in July in the form of letters Trump posted to his social media account. Many of them took effect on August 1 , including a 50-percent tariff on Brazil for its prosecution of a Trump ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro.
     Just this week, on August 27, India was also slapped with a 50-percent tariff as a result of its purchase of oil from Russia.
     Mexico, Canada and China, meanwhile, have faced Trump’s tariff threats since February, with Trump leveraging the import taxes to ensure compliance with his policies on border security and the drug fentanyl.
     US presidents do have limited power to issue tariffs in order to protect specific domestic industries, and Trump has exercised that power in the case of imported steel, aluminium and automobile products.
     But in general, the US Constitution places the power to issue taxes, including tariffs, under Congress, not the presidency.
     Lawsuits like Friday’s have therefore argued that Trump has exceeded his presidential authority in levying blanket tariffs.
     The appeals court decision also pointed out that the IEEPA does not give the presidency unchecked power.
     “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the ruling said.
     The decision came in response to two lawsuits: one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center, on behalf of five US small businesses, and the other by 12 US states.
     Still, on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump appeared defiant, emphasising that his tariffs would remain in place despite the appeals court’s decision.
     “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT! Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,” he wrote .
     He added that it was his view that tariffs “are the best tool to help our Workers”. He also implied he expected the Supreme Court to back him up in his appeal.
     “If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong,” Trump said.
     “Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation.”

60) Texas Governor Greg Abbott signs Trump-backed redistricting bill — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

     Texas redraw sparks gerrymandering fight nationwide, fueling voter power battles in states across the political divide.
     Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a bill to redraw the state’s congressional maps at the behest of President Donald Trump in an effort to flip five US House seats held by Democrats to Republicans.
     The Texas map, drafted in the rare mid-decade redistricting, prompted fierce protests from Democrats and sparked a gerrymandering tug-of-war for voters in states across the country.
     “Texas is now more red in the United States Congress,” Abbott said in a video post on social media, after signing the bill with a marker.
     The head of Texas’s Democratic Party criticised Abbott, saying he and Republicans “effectively surrendered Texas to Washington” with the new map.
     “They love to boast about how ‘Texas Tough’ they are, but when Donald Trump made one call, they bent over backwards to prioritise his politics over Texans,” state Democratic Party Chairman Kendall Scudder said in a statement. “Honestly, it’s pathetic.”
     The Texas map redraw has already reshaped the 2026 race, with Democratic Rep Lloyd Doggett, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, announcing that he would not seek reelection to his Austin-based seat if the new map takes effect. Under the proposed map, Doggett’s district would overlap with that of another Democratic incumbent, Rep Greg Casar.
     California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has emerged as a leading adversary of Trump on redistricting and other issues, tauntingly labelled Abbott on X as the president’s “#1 lapdog” following the signing.
     Republicans have acknowledged they believe winning more congressional seats in Texas will help the party maintain its slim majority in the US House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections. More states controlled by Republicans are considering similar action.
     California and other states where Democrats hold power vow to counter such moves. The California legislature approved a redistricting plan last week aimed at giving Democrats five more congressional seats.
     The California plan must be approved by voters in November. The Texas plan does not need voter approval, but it has been challenged in court.
     The Texas bill was delayed for two weeks after more than 50 Democratic state House members staged a walkout that denied Republicans the legislative quorum needed.
     Democrats argued that the new Texas map violates federal law by diluting Hispanic and Black voting power and discriminating based on race.
     Texas Republicans who sponsored the bill said they redrew maps based on voting history, not race.
     Most Americans believe redrawing congressional lines for the sake of maximising political gain, known as gerrymandering, is bad for democracy, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found this week.

61) Court blocks Trump effort to end protected status for Venezuelans — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Administration has sought to prematurely end status for 600,000 Venezuelans, leaving them vulnerable to deportation.
     A federal appeals court has blocked an effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to end special protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States.
     On Friday, a three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling, which kept in place Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans. The status will remain in place as the legal challenges proceed through the courts.
     Before leaving office, the Biden administration had extended TPS for about 600,000 Venezuelans through October 2026.
     The Trump administration has sought to end the extension, meaning that the status would expire for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, who were initially granted protection in 2023, in April of this year, and for approximately 250,000 Venezuelans, who were initially granted the status in 2021, by September.
     That would leave those affected unable to legally work and vulnerable to deportation .
     US District Judge Edward Chen had previously ruled in March that plaintiffs challenging the end of the protection were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration overstepped its authority.
     Lawyers for affected Venezuelans had argued the administration had been motivated by racial animus.
     At the time, Chen ordered a freeze on the termination. However, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling in an emergency appeal, temporarily allowing the administration to move forward in cancelling the status.
     Congress created Temporary Protected Status as part of the Immigration Act of 1990.
     It allows the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to grant legal immigration status to individuals fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disasters, or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to their home country.
     The Trump administration has increasingly targeted TPS recipients in its hardline approach to immigration, moving to terminate the programme for citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras and Nicaragua.
     While the administration has the authority to choose not to renew TPS, several courts have ruled against efforts to change already designated timelines.
     In Friday’s ruling, the judges wrote: “In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics”.

1) Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General — UN Press (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
     All right, good afternoon.
     ** Briefing Note
     A programming note.  It will be no surprise for you to learn that Monday is a holiday in the Unites States — Labour Day, which means that we will not be working.  But obviously, as usual, we will be available to you guys electronically.
     And at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, there will be a press briefing here by Mr. Sangjin Kim, the Chargé d’affaires of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations, and he will be here to speak to you in his role as President of the Security Council for the month of September, and it will be a busy month. He will, of course, brief you on the programme of work.  Just to note that this is just in-person; there will be no zoom link for this press conference.
     ** Senior Personnel Appointment
     A personnel announcement and a travel announcement to share with you.  A senior personnel announcement.  Today, the Secretary-General is appointing Diene Keita of Guinea as the new Executive Director of the UN Population Fund — UNFPA.  She succeeds Natalia Kanem of Panama, to whom the Secretary-General is deeply grateful for her dedicated service and outstanding commitment to the United Nations and UNFPA.
     Currently serving as the Acting Executive Director of UNFPA, Ms. Keita has served as Deputy Executive Director (Programme) of that organization since 2020, bringing over three decades of experience and leadership in international development and public service.  We congratulate her.
     ** Cyprus
     The Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, María Angela Holguín Cuéllar, will travel to Cyprus next week, meeting separately with the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders, [Nikos Christodoulides and Ersin Tatar, respectively].  That will take place on 2 September.  She is also scheduled to engage with the representatives of the two leaders, the members of the Technical Committee on Youth, and the Committee on Missing Persons, among other interlocutors.
     ** Sudan
     You will have seen that earlier this morning we issued a statement on Sudan.  The Secretary-General said he is appalled by the relentless attacks by the Rapid Support Forces on El Fasher in Sudan’s North Darfur State.
     El Fasher has been under a tightening siege for more than 500 days with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the area.  Recent weeks have seen near-continuous shelling of the area and repeated deadly incursions into the Abu Shouk displacement camp, where famine conditions were identified back in December 2024.  And as a stark reminder, since 11 August, our agencies documented at least 125 civilians having been killed in the El Fasher area, including through summary executions, with the actual death toll most likely much higher.
     The Secretary-General is alarmed at the grave risks of serious violations of international humanitarian law as well as violations and abuses of international human rights law, including ethnically motivated violations.
     Supplies are pre-positioned nearby but efforts by the United Nations and our partners to move them into El Fasher continue to be hampered.
     There have been repeated attacks on humanitarian personnel and assets in North Darfur in the recent months.
     The Secretary-General calls for an immediate ceasefire in El Fasher and areas around El Fasher.  He insists that immediate steps must be taken to protect civilians and enable the safe, unhindered and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance into the area, and to allow any civilians seeking to leave the area voluntarily to do so safely.
     The Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, is continuing to engage with the warring parties.  And of course, he stands ready to support genuine efforts to halt the violence and establish an inclusive political process that the people of Sudan are demanding.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     Turning to Gaza, and I can tell you that we are concerned that the Israeli offensive on Gaza City could have an even more horrific impact on people across the Strip if it intensifies further.
     We note that the Israeli announcement today that the daily tactical pauses have been discontinued in Gaza City — and that is an area that Israel now classifies as a “dangerous combat zone”.  That suspension will further threaten people’s lives and aid workers’ ability to support people.
     Our colleagues on the ground tell us that those declared pauses appeared to signal some willingness that humanitarian work should be allowed to move forward.  Yet, in recent weeks, they still observed bombing in areas and at times where such pauses had been declared.  OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) stresses that life-saving aid operations must be further enabled and not rolled back.
     Moreover, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to move further south is a recipe for further disaster and could amount to forcible transfer.
     We and our partners are remaining in Gaza City to provide life-saving support with a commitment to serve people wherever they are. We expect our work to be fully facilitated and remind parties that civilians, including humanitarian workers, must be protected at all times.  Humanitarian facilities and other civilian infrastructure must also be safeguarded.
     OCHA tells us that aid workers continue to face impediments to their movements inside the Gaza Strip.  Yesterday, one in every four such movements — which had been fully coordinated with authorities and initially approved — faced impediments and was unable to be fully accomplished.  That’s 4 out of a total of 16.  These impediments undermined the planned collection of cargo from crossings and much-needed road repairs.
     We also have a quick correction from yesterday:  I said that 200 herders each received two 100-kilogram sacks of animal feed.  Our friends in Rome at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have clarified that each sack was 50 kilograms, not 100.
     Turning to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that they continue to see very high levels of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians — and that has obvious a harsh impact on the humanitarian situation.
     Between last Tuesday and this Monday, OCHA documented at least 15 attacks that caused injuries or property damage in 13 Palestinian communities.  Those attacks left eight Palestinians injured and forced six herding families to flee their homes — that’s 15 adults and nearly 20 displaced children.
     OCHA says that settler violence has now become one of the main drivers of displacement of Palestinians throughout the West Bank.
     Just to give you some sense:  In one pocket of Bethlehem governorate, around Barriyet Kisan, OCHA says that it has recorded at least 64 Palestinian herding families who have had to leave since October 2023 because of persistent violence and intimidation by settlers.  That’s more than 100 adults and over 80 children.  Eighteen of those families were displaced just last month, after being assaulted or threatened, or after their property was destroyed or looted.
     Home demolitions are also driving families away.  Since the start of the year and as of this Monday, 873 Palestinians — half of them children — were displaced when Israeli authorities demolished or forced the demolition of their homes for not having the Israeli-issued building permits required.
     We call again on the protection of all civilians across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to stop these demolitions — and steps must also be taken against settler violence.
     ** Lebanon
     Turning to Lebanon, and following the mandate extension by the Security Council yesterday, UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) continues to conduct its operations to advance stability in southern Lebanon and along the Blue Line.
     Yesterday, our peacekeepers found an unauthorized mortar bomb in Sector East.  The day before, they discovered a weapons cache and infrastructure in Sector East as well, including a tunnel with boxes of explosive shells stored about 15 metres underground.
     Yesterday morning, a UNIFIL patrol was subjected to aggressive behaviour in Sector West when a group of five individuals pelted stones at the patrol, causing minor damage to the vehicles.  We reiterate once again that acts that endanger the peacekeepers and hamper their work are unacceptable and must stop.
     The peacekeepers also continue to observe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) military activities, including several air strikes on Thursday in our area of operations.
     Just to highlight the risks faced in securing southern Lebanon, yesterday two Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) personnel lost their lives in an explosion in Naqoura, and others were injured.  According to the Lebanese Armed Forces, the incident occurred while its personnel were inspecting a fallen IDF drone.
     As reaffirmed by the Security Council in its resolution 2790, the parties are to ensure full respect for the Blue Line and a full cessation of hostilities.
     We reiterate that the Lebanese Armed Force's full deployment across the south is central to resolution 1701 with UNIFIL coordinating closely with the Lebanese Armed Forces in support.
     ** Syria
     Moving to Syria:  We have been following with concern the developments in the Sumariyya neighbourhood in Damascus.  Our Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, says he is closely following these developments, including the reports of threats of evictions and the reports of abuses against innocent civilians, including women and children.
     We join Mr. Pedersen in urging restraint and refraining from precipitous or violent actions.
     The Special Envoy stresses that complex issues related to housing, land and property and to transitional justice need to be addressed with care, prioritizing the protection of civilians based on the rule of law and in line with international standards.
     As for the humanitarian situation in Syria, our colleagues there tell us that a convoy loaded with aid, involving UN agencies, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other partners, successfully reached Sweida Governorate via the main highway from Damascus.  This was the first movement on that road since 12 July, as it had been closed due to clashes we have been telling you about and you know of.  Since then, convoys had been rerouted through less direct roads, adding to logistics and security challenges to those operations.
     Yesterday’s convoy included 19 trucks carrying relief items such as food baskets, hygiene kits, nutrition supplies, fuel, medical supplies, and solar lamps.  In addition, colleagues carried out needs assessments in northern rural Sweida Governorate and in the town of Salkhad.
     As of 25 August, just a few days ago, and since mid-July, humanitarian partners report that clashes in Sweida Governorate have displaced more than 187,000 human beings, and they have been displaced across southern Syria.
     We and our partners continue to scale up the response. Between July and August, 370,000 people across Sweida, Dar’a, and Rural Damascus Governorates have received some form of humanitarian assistance.
     ** Burkina Faso
     Two things I want to share with you that I am discovering as well, because there were just brought to me.  One is a statement on Burkina Faso.
     The Secretary-General has learned with regret that, on 18 August, the Burkinabe transitional authorities declared our Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator Carol Flore-[Smereczniak] persona non grata .  He expresses full confidence in her professionalism and dedication and in the broader United Nations system in Burkina Faso.
     The United Nations system, led by our Resident Coordinator, has been working closely with the Burkinabe transitional authorities to support development efforts and provide humanitarian assistance.
     The doctrine of persona non grata does not apply to United Nations officials, and we have said this repeatedly and in different contexts.  Under Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of this Organization, United Nations staff members are appointed by the Secretary-General. They are responsible only to the Organization, and UN Member States undertake to respect their exclusively international character.  In accordance with Article 105 of the Charter, there are accorded privileges and immunities, including the right of its staff members to remain in Burkina [Faso] to perform their functions on behalf of the Organization.  Only the Secretary-General, as the Chief Administrative Officer of the UN, has the authority to decide, after careful investigation, on the withdrawal of any UN official.
     The Secretary-General reaffirms the commitment of the United Nations to continue supporting the people of Burkina Faso in full cooperation with the transitional authorities.
     ** Colombia
     The UN Verification Mission in Colombia has welcomed the liberation of 33 soldiers from the Colombian armed forces who had been held against their will by local residents of a community in southern Colombia for several days amid military operations against armed groups and illicit crops in the area.  Colombia’s Minister [for Defense] thanked the Mission for its assistance in facilitating their release in the Department of Guaviare.  Citing excellent cooperation with authorities in support of the soldier's release, the Mission reiterated its continued commitment to the communities and institutions to achieve sustainable peace in the area.
     ** Haiti
     I can also tell you that we are encouraged that the Security Council is poised to take further action to improve international support for security in Haiti in response to armed gangs operating in that country.  And I think we have been giving you a clear picture of the horrendous situation that those armed gangs have caused.
     We reiterate the Secretary-General's recommendation to strengthen the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission through UN logistical and operational support funded by the UN peacekeeping budget, as well as his call for the implementation of the UN sanctions regime and decisive progress in Haiti's political process.
     We welcome the decision by Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kenya, the Bahamas and the United States to establish a Standing Group of Partners to provide high-level strategic direction, oversight, and political decision-making for any revamped security force and look forward to working closely with that Group.
     ** Nepal
     A quick update from our UN team in Nepal, where health authorities reported a suspected cholera outbreak in the Birgunj Metropolitan City a few days ago.
     National health authorities are leading the response and have activated the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene — or WASH — Cluster, with support from our UN team on the ground.
     The World Health Organization (WHO) is providing expertise in epidemiology, case investigation, lab testing, vaccination planning and information management.
     Our colleagues at UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) have also distributed water purifiers, medicines and hygiene supplies, and mobilized volunteers to engage households on prevention and safe practices.
     ** International Days
     International days, [three] very important ones.
     Today is the International Day against Nuclear Tests. In his message , the Secretary-General says that we must never forget the legacy of over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests carried out over the last 80 years, driving displacement and contaminating lands and oceans.  His message to leaders is “to silence the bombs before they speak again”.
     Tomorrow is the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, a strategy that has been used frequently to support terror within societies.
     And on Sunday, we mark the International Day for People of African Descent.  The Secretary-General says on this Day, we honour the extraordinary contributions of people of African descent across every sphere of human endeavour.  But we also recognise enduring injustices.  Three very important days.
     ** Andrea Tenenti
     Two more items.  And I know it’s Friday and you want to get out of here, but I do want to salute the retirement of a legendary spokesman.
     Our friend and colleague Andrea Tenenti has been, give or take a few years, the voice and the face of UNIFIL since the paint was still wet on the markers along the Blue Line.
     Throughout his years at UNIFIL, Andrea has been consistent in his professionalism, his passion and his belief in the UN’s Mission.
     We wish him a future with clear blue skies and calm all around and no phones.
     ** Financial Contribution
     Finally, we have money.  We have a quiz for you.
     This country that has paid today is known for having the most pyramids in the world.  [responses from the crowd]  Not Mexico, not Egypt.  Sudan, exactly.
     So today we thank our friends in Khartoum for their full payment to the Regular Budget.  We are now up to fully paid-up 122 Member States.  Dezhi, you won.  Sorry, Edie.
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Sorry, Edie.  I have several questions.  Well first of all, the US State Department just issued the statement saying that it's denying and revoking visas for members of the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and the Palestinian Authority before the UN General Assembly in September. Any reaction from the Secretary-General on this announcement?
     Spokesman :  We've learned of this, just like you, through the press statements.  We're obviously going to follow up.  We'll discuss these matters with the State Department in line with the UN Headquarters Agreement between the UN and the US.
     Question :  And yesterday, there are more than 500 staffers in the Office for High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote a letter, signed a letter to ask Mr. [Voler] Türk to describe the Gaza war as a genocide.  Any comments from the Secretary-General on the behaviour of the staff? [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  One of your colleagues asked me the same question yesterday.  I'm happy to repeat my answer, which is, first of all, the Secretary-General's full and complete confidence in the work of Volker Türk as High Commissioner for Human Rights.  To reiterate something we have said hundreds of times here, the labelling of an event as a genocide for us is up to a competent legal, judicial authority. I think, if people paid attention, they would see how vocal Volker Türk has been about the horrors going on in Gaza. And they will also take note of the rather direct and pointed criticism from the Israeli authorities for everything that he said.
     Question :  Sorry.  One last thing.
     Spokesman :  Sure.
     Question :  The Grand National Assembly of Türkiye today adopted a motion, urged UN to suspend the membership of Israel until it's changed its policy on Gaza.  My question is there a way to really suspend?
     Spokesman :  I would encourage you to read the Charter, and all of that is left up to Member States.  Edie Lederer and then Amelie.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Does the Secretary-General have any comment on the announcement by the White House today that it's blocking $4.9 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress, including $520 million for the UN regular budget and other organizations such as UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), as well as $838 million for international peacekeeping?
     Spokesman :  I mean, we've obviously learned of this like you all did.  We saw the press reports.  We saw the actual announcement.  What can I tell you?  This is going to make our budget situation, our liquidity situation that much more challenging, but we will follow up with US authorities to get more details.
     Question :  And secondly, on the Resident Coordinator in Burkina Faso being declared persona non grata , I wasn't clear from what you said whether she is staying in Burkina Faso or is she leaving?
     Spokesman :  No.  She left the country a few days ago.  Amelie?
     Question :  Edie asked my question.
     Spokesman :  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Linda, would you ask a question that Dezhi has not asked, and we'll go to Gabriel.
     Question :  That's going to be hard.  […]
     Spokesman :  Go ahead.
     Question :  Okay.  Turning to Yemen.  I was just wondering what the status is of UN efforts to get, you know, UN staff, diplomats, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), sailors, and all kinds of people released by the Houthis?
     Spokesman :  I mean, we continue to advocate publicly.  We continue to advocate privately, including through contacts with Member States who may have a more direct line to Ansar Allah and the Houthis.  And we continue to bring their plight to attention.  I think our colleagues who briefed on Yemen talk about it all the time, and we will not forget our colleagues and others who remain in legally detained.  Your microphone?
     Question :  Is there some kind of formal mechanism that's there?  Is it Iran that you’re asking for help?  [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  I mean, the mechanism being the…  [cross-talk]  We've raised this in discussions with Iranian authorities.  This is issue that our Resident Coordinator raises.  This is issues that Mr. [Hans] Grundberg, our Special Envoy, raises.  We hope that they'd be released.  They deserve to be released immediately.  Gabriel?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Would the US preventing President [Mahmoud] Abbas from speaking at the UN General Assembly violate the UN Headquarters Agreement?
     Spokesman :  We are going to discuss this with the State Department.  I mean, the Headquarters Agreement deserves to be read — notably, I think, sections 11 and 12.  We obviously hope that this will be resolved.  It is important that all Member States, permanent observers, be able to be represented — especially, I think in this case, as we know, with the upcoming two-State solution meeting that France and Saudi Arabia will host at the beginning of the GA.
     Question :  Would the Secretary-General like the US Government to revoke this decision?
     Spokesman :  Well, obviously, we would like to see all diplomats and delegates who are entitled to come here to be able to travel freely.  Iftikhar, I see you.  Iftikhar, I think you've just turned off your camera.  Alright.  Any question?  Oh, Iftikhar, go ahead.  There we go. Go ahead.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Any update on the floods in Pakistan?  And now it is a deluge with 250,000 people displaced.
     Spokesman :  I have not received any updates today, but we will ask our humanitarian colleagues to give you something before close of business.
     Question :  Thank you.
     Spokesman :  All right.  Yes, sir?
     Question :  Sorry.  I know you won't.
     Spokesman :  All right.  One more question.  Don't move.
     Question :  I just had a quick question for you.  The Iranian Foreign Ministry said today in a statement that the move by the E3 to implement a snapback mechanism of resolution 2231 will gravely undermine its ongoing cooperation with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency).  Just any reactions?
     Spokesman :  Well, I think as I said yesterday, we very much hope that this window of opportunity will be used for diplomacy to resolve all outstanding issues, and that the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue its cooperation with the IAEA.  Okay.  Dezhi sorry.  You raised your hand.  [cross-talk]
     Question :  We don't have briefing on Monday, or do we have?
     Spokesman :  Dezhi, you were just…
     Question :  I was late.  I was late. [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  You were not listening to…  you have access to your office.  You're more welcome to come in here on Monday.  You will be alone.  [laughter]

2) Secretary-General Expresses Regret Over Declaration of Resident Coordinator as Persona Non Grata in Burkina Faso, Reaffirms Support for Country — UN Press (2025-08-29)

3) Brutal Escalation of Large-Scale Russian Federation Attacks on Ukraine Setting Grim Casualty Records, Jeopardizing Fragile Diplomatic Momentum, Security Council Hears — UN Press (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16160.doc.htm
   Text:
     Warning that the Ukrainian people caught in the crossfire are “entering the fourth winter of the full-scale war”, a top UN official told the Security Council today that the Russian Federation’s large-scale escalation of attacks against civilians persist, killing children, setting grim casualty records and jeopardizing fragile diplomatic momentum.
     Miroslav Jenča, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas at the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the Secretary-General on Thursday condemned Moscow’s deadly overnight missile and drone attacks.  “Yesterday’s strikes are only the latest in the brutal escalation of country-wide aerial attacks,” he said.
     Ukrainian officials reported that, between 27 and 28 August alone, 598 drones and 31 missiles were launched, killing at least 23 people in Kyiv, including 4 children.
     Mr. Jenča stressed the expanding scope of violence, saying these strikes targeted regions far from the front lines.  “In July, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded rising civilian casualties across 18 regions of Ukraine,” he told the 15-member Council, with July setting a record of 1,674 casualties — the highest since May 2022.
     Since the invasion began, 14,054 civilians, including 730 children, have been killed, while more than 36,000 have been injured, he said, also acknowledging the conflict’s spillover into the Russian Federation where there have been civilian casualties in Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk.
     On 24 August, “a fire broke out after a Ukrainian drone was shot down near the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant”, damaging a transformer, he said. While the UN could not verify all reports of Ukrainian strikes inside the Russian Federation, Mr. Jenča cautioned: “The growing impact of the conflict on the civilian population in the Russian Federation is of concern, too.”  All attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure violate international humanitarian law, he reiterated.
     Underscoring that preparations are under way to provide targeted winter support for 1.7 million people in need, he stressed:  “Scaled up and flexible donor support is urgently needed” to continue to provide life-saving operations.
     Mr. Jenča also welcomed recent meetings in Anchorage and Washington, D.C., but warned that, as large-scale attacks against civilians persist, “the current diplomatic momentum is at risk of rapidly fading”.  He closed by reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire one that fully upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
     In the ensuing discussion, Council Members condemned the Russian Federation’s latest attack on Ukraine, with Slovenia’s delegate emphasizing that Moscow’s second-largest air assault of the war on 28 August saw 620 drones and missiles launched mostly at Kyiv, destroying residential buildings and damaging the European Union delegation and British Council premises.  These are “not military targets”, but densely populated areas, she stressed.
     The delegate of France also condemned in the “strongest possible terms” Moscow’s latest strikes, calling them “unacceptable”.  Recalling that President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has “shown his availability to implement an immediate, unconditional ceasefire” and willingness to engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, he said that Moscow has instead responded with more deadly strikes.  “Russia says it believes in peace and diplomacy; such brutal attacks say the opposite,” the delegate from the United Kingdom added.
     Other Council members underscored how the war in Ukraine was affecting regions beyond Europe, with the Republic of Korea’s representative voicing concern over the ongoing Moscow–Pyongyang military cooperation that is exacerbating the war’s severity and its bleak ramifications.  Algeria’s delegate noted the conflict’s impact on food and energy markets causing soaring prices in her country, region and beyond.  “The cost of this conflict, while borne most heavily by the Ukrainian people, is also being paid by the entire region and global community,” added Guyana’s speaker, echoing calls for an urgent intensification of diplomatic dialogue to end the conflict.
     “The Ukraine issue is entering a critical stage for negotiated settlement,” stated China’s delegate.  He welcomed ongoing talks, noting the continued engagement of all relevant parties towards a solution, expressing hope that the parties concerned will “meet each other halfway and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiation”.
     The United States representative stated that, in recent weeks, Washington, D.C., has undertaken “exceptional efforts to bring the Russian-Ukrainian war to an end”.  On 15 August, President Donald J. Trump met face to face with President Putin in Alaska — the first summit-level meeting between the two countries since Moscow launched its invasion over three years ago.  Building on that progress, President Trump then hosted President Zelenskyy and seven other European leaders at the White House on 18 August.
     However, the latest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine “cast doubts on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace”, he pointed out, underscoring that such strikes on civilian areas must stop immediately.  “Russia must decide now to move towards peace,” he asserted, urging the leaders of both countries to agree to meet bilaterally, warning of further economic measures with “far-reaching consequences” should Moscow choose to prolong the war.
     The speaker for the Russian Federation dismissed Western accusations as a “fairly primitive template” over its 28 August strikes, insisting its attacks targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex”, including arms depots, airfields and UAV factories, not civilians.  Rather, civilian deaths resulted from Ukrainian air defences placed in residential areas, he said, accusing Kyiv of “shamelessly and criminally” using Ukrainians as “human shields”.  The tragedies are being “intentionally whipped up to blame the deaths of Ukrainian civilians on Russia” to secure more Western arms and sanctions, he said.  Moscow further accused the West of hypocrisy, ignoring Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian cities that killed and wounded scores of civilians in late August.
     He also alleged rampant corruption and repression inside Ukraine, citing reports of political prisoners, restrictions on the Orthodox Church and off-shore assets tied to President Zelenskyy’s circle.  He said the West’s selective blindness undermines its credibility, while reiterating demands for security guarantees that address the Russian Federation’s concerns.  He accused Kyiv of “skyrocketing human rights violations”.  Referring to the Alaska Summit, he said his Government remains open to negotiations, but only on terms that exclude North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion and recognize Russian Federation interests, accusing Kyiv of blocking compromise and pursuing “PR over diplomacy”.
     Yulia Svyrydenko, Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the Council that the Russian Federation’s 28 August assault marked one of the deadliest nights of the war, with “629 airborne weapons” launched against cities, killing 25 people — including 4 children — and wounding 63 others.  Among the victims was a girl “not yet three years old, born under Russian shelling in October 2022, and killed by Russian shelling in August 2025”, she said.  The strikes, which also damaged the European Union Delegation and British Council premises, were “deliberate acts of terror”, she said, demanding stronger air defence and long-range capabilities to protect civilians, alongside tougher sanctions to deprive Moscow of funds for its war.
     Prime Minister Svyrydenko also highlighted the Russian Federation’s systematic abduction of children, citing cases of forced adoption and identity erasure.  “Russia kills children from a distance with missiles and drones, and those who fall under its control it steals,” she said.  She urged the Council to act, insisting that peace requires both bolstering its defence and intensifying pressure on Moscow until it shows genuine willingness to negotiate.  “Aggression must be punished, never rewarded,” she declared, reaffirming readiness for a just, lasting peace based on sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law.
     Several European countries took to the floor, as well, expressing support for Ukraine and condemning the Russian Federation’s attacks, with Poland’s speaker stating that, if Moscow hopes to break the spirit of resistance and solidarity, it is “gravely mistaken”.  “Recent strikes only strengthen our determination to support Ukraine,” he said, urging allies to impose restrictive measures that will further undercut Moscow’s revenues and weaken its capacity to wage war.
     “Putin does not seek even a temporary ceasefire, let alone a lasting peace,” said Estonia’s delegate, speaking also for Latvia and Lithuania.  She stressed that the Russian Federation must be held fully accountable for the crime of aggression and “for every war crime committed”.  Perpetrators must face justice, including through a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression.  “There can be no lasting peace without accountability,” she added.
     “Once again, Russia has demonstrated its complete disregard for civilian lives — and diplomatic missions,” said Norway’s delegate, speaking also for Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden.  Citing a ceasefire as “the necessary first step”, he noted that Ukraine has been ready for a ceasefire for several months while “Russia stands in the way”. However, peace in Ukraine cannot be negotiated without Ukraine’s participation, and “security guarantees will be needed”, he stressed, adding that the people of Ukraine require peace in accordance with international law, “not a pause for Russia to prepare for renewed aggression”.
     The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, said that, as high-level talks for peace are ongoing, Moscow has launched yet another massive and brutal overnight attack against Ukrainian cities and civilians.  Ordinary civilians — including children as young as two years old — have paid the ultimate price of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and illegal aggression.  “Such blatant violations of international law and the inviolability of diplomatic premises only strengthen our resolve to stand with Ukraine and its people,” he asserted.
     “The latest missile attack on Kyiv on 27 August is not a mistake,” stressed Romania’s delegate, adding that it was followed less than 24 hours later by a drone attack on a Ukrainian ship on the Danube Delta, near the Romanian border and near the Black Sea.  “These continuous attacks are not the path to peace.  And we need peace,” he emphasized.
     In the aftermath of the latest attacks, said Germany’s delegate, “we have to ask ourselves:  What is Russia’s intention?”  For weeks and months, that country’s leaders and diplomats have been claiming to seek negotiations and peace.  But, at the same time, they relentlessly launch rockets into residential areas of Ukraine.  Underscoring the need to respect the territorial integrity of UN Member States, he said Berlin — together with its allies — will support Ukraine in its right to defend itself “as long as it takes”.  He stated:  “Every night the people of Ukraine have to spend in fear is one too much.  It is time to act.”

4) Marine Biodiversity Treaty’s Preparatory Commission Concludes Second Session as Mounting Ratifications Raise Stakes for Intersessional Work — UN Press (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The commission tasked with preparing for the entry into force of a new treaty on marine biodiversity concluded its second session today, with delegates taking stock of the extensive negotiations held over the last two weeks and committing to doing “homework” before its third session to ensure that the treaty can be operationalized with appropriate financial and institutional mechanisms.
     The gathering, formally known as the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”, was held from 18 to 29 August.  Its first session was held from 14 to 25 April, and its third will convene from 23 March to 2 April 2026.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     The Agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023.  During today’s meeting, the Chair announced that Saint Kitts and Nevis ratified the treaty, becoming the fifty-fourth country to do so.  (The European Union has also ratified.)  Further, Ukraine signed the Agreement today, bringing the total number of signatures to 141.  The Agreement will enter into force 120 days after the date of deposit of the sixtieth instrument of ratification, approval, acceptance or accession thereto and, per its terms, the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties shall be convened no later than one year after the Agreement’s entry into force.
     In closing statements, delegates looked forward to this milestone, with Co-Chair Janine Coye-Felson (Belize) noting that this “does put the pressure of time on all of us”.  She called for an open exchange, a focus on key issues and continued support, adding:  “I have a begging bowl out.”  Her fellow Co-Chair Adam McCarthy (Australia) noted the importance of not leaving the Commission overloaded at its third session, adding that “by and large, we have been very, very successful in that regard”.  He said:  “We have a Convention that will be entering into force end of December, start of January [2026].” and a first Conference of the Parties sometime towards the end of 2026.  Therefore, “our work has become more intensified than it ever was; the time-bound nature of it is more clear than it’s ever been”, he stressed.
     Speaking for the Core Latin American Group, the representative of Colombia stressed the need to circulate — before the Commission’s next session — a draft decision on the institutional arrangements for the functioning of the Agreement’s secretariat, also reiterating the need to set a deadline on the dissemination of information concerning headquarters proposals.  The third session should seek to adopt consensus recommendations regarding the seat of the secretariat’s headquarters, she said.
     Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking for the African Group, called for the early release of revised drafts.  A revised draft text on terms of reference, modalities and rules of procedure for all subsidiary bodies will facilitate the swift operationalization of the Agreement upon its entry into force, she underscored.  Further, she called on the Co-Chairs to identify the relevant tasks that can be done intersessionally to “facilitate maximum progress at the next session”.
     The representative of Palau, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said:  “We had hopes that that we would have achieved more.”  She expressed disappointment over attempts to undermine the recognition of the special circumstances of small island developing States — this is a legal obligation under the Agreement and cannot be treated as an afterthought.  Calling on the international community to transform the Agreement “from a vessel of promise into one equipped for effective implementation”, she said that small island developing States are not just passengers on this vessel; “we are powering its movement, paddling alongside others to propel us towards entry into force”.
     Along similar lines, Tuvalu’s representative, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, emphasized that “the special circumstances of small island developing States must guide the work of this Agreement”.  Tonga’s representative, speaking for the Pacific Islands Forum, urged delegations’ flexibility so that the Commission can finish its work in a timely manner.  “We need to be clear-eyed about the likely limited time remaining until the entry into force of the Agreement and the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties,” she stressed.
     The European Union’s representative, in its capacity as observer, underlined the importance of efficiency, cautioned against reopening the Agreement and added:  “We want the majority of the resources that we invest in this Agreement to be directed to the purpose of the Agreement.”
     The Commission also heard from Vladimir Jares, Director of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, who updated delegates on the current financial state of the voluntary trust fund.  That fund has helped 30 delegations from developing countries — 27 of whom hailed from least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States — participate in the Commission’s work.  He noted that two delegates cancelled at the last minute due to personal reasons, and “the Division, mindful of its fiduciary responsibilities, is working with them to ensure the return of the advances that were provided”. As of 28 August, the trust fund had an estimated balance of $50,000, he reported.
     On that, Colombia’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, noted that the Group is composed of “very small delegations” — sometimes consisting of only one person.  “We really do depend on the voluntary trust fund,” she emphasized, expressing regret that several members’ applications to benefit from it were denied.  As such, she urged those able to contribute to the trust fund to do so.
     In the morning, the Commission again took up the rules of procedure for meetings of the Conference of the Parties, guided by a compilation of draft rules prepared by the Co-Chairs (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.3 ).  Among the topics they discussed were the rules governing the participation of observers in the Conference of the Parties and in the meetings of the Agreement’s subsidiary bodies, for which the draft document offered three different options.
     Singapore’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said that the “broad, by-default approach that is set out in option I” may not strike a balance between transparency and the prudent use of limited time and resources.  Stressing the need for efficient functioning of the Agreement’s procedures, he said that the provisions outlined in options II and III “would not be unduly restrictive” while permitting a high degree of transparency.
     Morocco’s representative, speaking for the African Group, stressed the need for “a transparent accreditation process based on consensus or the absence of objections”.  The group does not favour option I, which is “too open-ended and mixes categories”.  However, he said that the Group is “open to refining” option II, which is “more detailed and addresses a number of concerns”, and option III, which is “inspired by the practice of the Economic and Social Council and could represent a workable balance”.  The representative of China also said that “we cannot accept option I”, while expressing support for option II and flexibility on option III.
     The representative of the Philippines, however, expressed support for option I, adding that “the no-objection element — which allows for the possibility of a single State vetoing the participation of [a non-governmental organization] in options II and III — seem contrary to the spirit of article 48 of the Agreement [which concerns transparency]”.
     Along similar lines, the Republic of Korea’s representative, also opposing options II and III, agreed that they are not consistent with article 48 of the Agreement — which is “intended to promote transparency and to ensure that observer participation is not unduly restricted”.  She pointed out that options II and III would also require Parties to consider requests for observer participation, which “would not be an efficient use of limited time”.
     The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed that observer participation and broad representation of diverse stakeholders at the Conference of the Parties and the Agreement’s subsidiary bodies “ensures that a wide variety of knowledge — which is often specialized and technical — is available to ensure that decisions are taken on the best available science”.  Further, observers can provide “a critical and necessary countervoice” to those of State Parties.  The Commission is not only bound to facilitate observer participation, but also to avoid provisions that limit observer access “or suggest that observer participation is a privilege” and not a right, he said.
     Delegates also considered the upcoming ninth replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility, with the aid of a document prepared by the Co-Chairs titled “Elements of possible provisional guidance to the Global Environment Facility ninth replenishment process”.
     The United Kingdom’s representative affirmed that her delegation was “absolutely fine” with that document, urging colleagues to support it.  She further called on delegates involved in the Global Environment Facility’s Council “to speak to their colleagues working in that forum, as well, and to reinforce the importance of this process to all of us”.
     However, Brazil’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, said that the Commission “did not have time to fully debate the Elements document”.  She added that this is “not a trivial matter”; it touches upon substantive matters related to the Agreement’s implementation.  Such detailed programming direction should be given by the Conference of the Parties after thorough debate on the operationalization of the special fund, she said.
     It was then decided that the Commission will not provide any provisional guidance to the ninth replenishment process of the Global Environmental Facility.
     Also today, Chile’s delegate reported on the “BBNJ First Movers Initiative”, which is being led by 10 countries, including his.  That initiative is a voluntary space to share experiences and promote international partnerships to support the development of marine protected areas in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  He stressed the need “to consolidate the portfolio of marine protected areas in the high seas as soon as possible”.
     The Preparatory Commission will resume its work at its third session in 2026.

5) Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
     ** Guest Today
     Just in a short while, I will be joined by Edem Wosornu who is as you know is the Director of Operations and Advocacy at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and she will be here to brief you on her recent visit and travels to Sudan and Chad.
     ** Secretary-General’s Travels
     Speaking of travels, later tonight, the Secretary-General will travel to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Leaders’ Summit taking place in Tianjin.  At the summit, on Monday, the Secretary-General will address the "SCO-plus" session.  He’s expected to recall that as we are moving towards a multipolar world, we need to strengthen multilateralism, uphold the rule of law, and deliver for people – as reflected in the Pact for the Future.  He is expected to underline the unique position of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to help shape a more inclusive and sustainable future.
     While in Tianjin, the Secretary-General is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with President Xi [Jinping], the President of the People’s Republic of China, as well as with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, Wang Yi.  He is also expected to have a number of other bilaterals with leaders attending the meeting. We will share an update on those bilaterals as they happen.
     On Tuesday, 2 September, the Secretary-General will arrive in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.  At the invitation of Prime Minister James Marape, the Secretary-General will take part in events to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Papua New Guinea’s independence.
     On Wednesday, 3 September, the Secretary-General is scheduled to deliver an address to the Parliament, during which he will highlight how in just 50 years, in a land of over 800 languages and countless traditions, the people of Papua New Guinea have undertaken the task of forging a nation from profound diversity, with a shared commitment to speak with one voice for peace, for dignity and for progress.
     He will also emphasize that this is his first trip to the Pacific since the landmark advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) — in which the region played a central role.  You will recall that the opinion affirms that addressing the climate crisis is a legal obligation under international law. And finally, just to note that this will be the first visit to Papua New Guinea ever by a sitting UN Secretary-General. The Secretary-General will be back in New York on 6 September.
     ** Deputy Secretary-General/Chile
     Our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, is in Santiago, Chile at the invitation of the Government.  This morning, she delivered remarks at the World Summit on Teachers, organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Government of Chile.  Ms. Mohammed highlighted the future of teaching in the age of Artificial Intelligence, the global shortage of teachers, and the ongoing education financing crisis.  She also spoke about the challenges faced by teachers in conflict settings.
     The Deputy Secretary-General stressed that quality education is the foundation of everything the world hopes to achieve through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda:  healthy lives, a healthy planet, opportunities, a sense of belonging, equality and peace.  She also emphasized that, without teachers, none of it is possible, adding that teachers are the beating heart of education, the cornerstone of sustainable development and the guardians of our future, and we must support them.
     While in Santiago, she held bilateral meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, Alberto van Klaveren Stork, and with Minister for Education of Chile, Nicolás Cataldo Astorga.  She also met with the UN country team, as well as youth and civil society representatives, listening to their perspectives on their priorities, challenges, and opportunities around sustainable development, human rights, and partnerships.  Ms. Mohammed will be back in New York City tomorrow.
     ** Gaza
     In remarks delivered to you this morning, the Secretary-General said that Israel’s initial steps to militarily take over Gaza City signals a new and dangerous phase.  Expanded military operations in Gaza City will have devastating consequences, he warned. Mr. [António] Guterres said that the levels of death and destruction in Gaza are without parallel in recent times.  Famine is no longer a looming possibility — it is a present-day catastrophe, he added. The Secretary-General said that starvation of the civilian population must never be used as a method of warfare.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     And turning to the situation actually on the ground as we speak in Gaza, our humanitarian colleagues are deeply concerned about the risk of a looming Israeli offensive on additional parts of Gaza City.  Some neighbourhoods have already seen deadly attacks in recent days.  Our humanitarian colleagues say the impact of a full-blown offensive would be beyond catastrophic — not only for those in the city but for the entire Gaza Strip.
     Our colleagues tracking population movements report that about 1,300 people fled from northern to southern Gaza yesterday and today. That brings the total number of north-south movements since 14 August — which is the day the plan for the offensive was announced — to 20,000.  Displacement is also happening within the north itself.  Altogether, since 14 August, some 60,000 displacements originating from Gaza City have been recorded.
     Across the Gaza Strip, hundreds of thousands of families continue to live in overcrowded, undignified and unsafe conditions at displacement sites.  Today, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Executive Director, Cindy McCain, called for faster approvals to move supplies into and within Gaza, as well as for safety for people to reach aid, and for humanitarian workers to reach those who need support.  Ms. McCain also made this statement after visiting the Gaza Strip, where she saw the destruction and desperation firsthand.
     With famine now confirmed in Gaza Governorate, Ms. McCain called for the right conditions to be put in place so WFP can reinstate its vast network of 200 food-distribution points, community kitchens and bakeries. She visited a nutrition clinic that’s keeping children alive and spoke with displaced mothers who described their daily struggle to survive, often searching for scraps of food but finding nothing.  As WFP noted, there has been a moderate increase in the amount of humanitarian and commercial goods entering the Strip.  But, this is still far below what’s needed to support 2 million people, many of them in extreme hunger.
     On a positive note, yesterday, for the first time since March, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was able to provide vital animal feed to herders in Deir al Balah.  They announced that 200 herders received two 100-kilogramme sacks each — a crucial step to protect livestock and help curb the spread of famine.
     Meanwhile, OCHA says that delays and impediments of humanitarian movements within Gaza continue, with movements that are approved by Israeli authorities still taking hours to complete.  Teams have been left waiting on roads that are often dangerous, congested, or impassable.
     Between last Wednesday and this Tuesday, out of 89 attempts to coordinate movements with Israeli authorities across the Gaza Strip, only 59 per cent were facilitated.  Another 26 per cent were initially approved, but then impeded on the ground, 8 per cent were denied outright and 7 per cent had to be withdrawn by the organizers.  Among the 23 impeded movements, 5 were fully accomplished, including to collect supplies from crossings and medically evacuate patients. The remaining 18 missions were not fully accomplished.
     ** Lebanon
     And like all of you, we have just seen the Security Council adopt unanimously a new resolution that extends for a final time the mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as it was set out by resolution 1701 (2006) until 31 December 2026.  At the request of the Security Council, the Secretary-General will explore, by 1 June 2026, options for the future of the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) after the withdrawal of UNIFIL.  Acknowledging the changed situation on the ground and as requested by the Security Council, UNIFIL will continue conducting its operations in support of the implementation by the parties of resolution 1701 (2006) until the end of its mandate.
     On 31 December 2026, the Mission will start within one year to carry out its orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal, with the aim of making the Government of Lebanon the sole provider of security in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL’s liquidation will begin after the conclusion of the drawdown and withdrawal phase.  I can confirm to you that we will cooperate closely, obviously, with the Governments of Lebanon and Israel to ensure a safe and orderly transition in our area of operations.  The United Nations Department of Peace Operations (DPO) will also closely engage with the troop-contributing countries to coordinate UNIFIL’s forthcoming withdrawal. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting the parties in their efforts to fully implement resolution 1701 (2006) and take the necessary steps towards a permanent ceasefire and lasting stability for the people on both sides of the Blue Line.
     ** Ukraine
     Turning to Ukraine:  Today, the Secretary-General held a phone call with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  The Secretary-General and the President discussed the recent diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.  The Secretary-General stressed the importance of sustaining the diplomatic momentum and reaffirmed the United Nations’ principled position in support of a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire as a first step towards a just, comprehensive and sustainable peace for Ukraine, in line with the UN Charter, international law and relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  The Secretary-General further reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to continue to address Ukraine’s humanitarian needs on the ground and support recovery and reconstruction efforts.
     You will have seen that earlier this morning, we issued a statement in which the Secretary-General condemned the overnight missile and drone attacks by the Russian Federation on Ukrainian cities, which killed and injured many civilians, including children.  The Secretary-General stressed that attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure violate international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must end immediately.  That full statement was shared with you.
     And on the ground, Mattias Schmale, the Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator for Ukraine, also condemned the attacks, stressing that they highlight the constant danger facing civilians in Kyiv and cities across Ukraine. And I also have some more details about the situation on the ground from our teams there.  They tell us that at least 15 people were killed and 40 injured in the overnight attacks by the Russian Federation on the capital, Kyiv. According to authorities, the strikes destroyed a five-story building and damaged more than 100 residential buildings, a kindergarten, a shopping centre, media offices, the premises of humanitarian organizations, and also damaged the offices of the European Union Delegation and the British Council.  The Ukrainian Railway Company also reported damage to their facilities and intercity trains.
     Humanitarians and local authorities responded immediately. Humanitarian organizations provided psychosocial support and began registering impacted families for cash assistance, while local authorities arranged temporary shelter for people who lost their homes.
     Meanwhile, hostilities in front-line regions continue. Local authorities report that six people were killed and dozens injured yesterday and today.  Damage to civilian infrastructure was also reported in the regions of Kherson, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro.  In the region of Vinnytsia, authorities reported that strikes on energy infrastructure left some 60,000 households without electricity across 30 towns and villages.  This follows earlier attacks on energy facilities in six regions, heightening the concerns ahead of winter.  And in Donetsk, nearly 200 people, including 50 children, were evacuated over the past days due to escalating fighting.
     ** Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
     A number of you this morning have asked me about the letter sent from France, Germany and the United Kingdom to the President of the Security Council in accordance with resolution 2231 (2015).  I can tell you that the Secretary-General is aware that today [28 August], the Security Council received this joint letter from the three countries.
     The Secretary-General urges the JCPOA participants and the Security Council to continue negotiations to find a diplomatic solution that ensures the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme and brings about economic benefits to the people of Iran.  In the next 30 days, there is a window of opportunity to avoid any further escalation and find a way forward that serves peace.  The Secretary-General welcomes any efforts towards that end.  He also underscores the imperative to exert all efforts to prevent a renewed military conflict and calls for prioritizing dialogue to address concerns related to Iran’s nuclear programme and broader regional security.
     ** Haiti
     This morning, if you remember that far, the Secretary-General briefed a Security Council session on the humanitarian situation in Haiti. The people of Haiti, he said, are in a perfect storm of suffering, he said as he reminded Council members that the country remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded.  Turning to the plight of children.  The Secretary-General said children are bearing the brunt of this crisis.  They are abducted, they are killed, they are recruited and they are used, and they are subjected to horrific sexual violence, including gang rape.  These are crimes that scar bodies, minds and futures, he told Council members.
     On the political situation, the Secretary-General noted emerging signals of hope.  He urged the Council to act without delay and authorize an international force, supported by the United Nations through logistical and operational backing and predictable financing.  Voluntary contributions to the Multinational Security Support Trust Fund remain essential, but assessed support would ensure impact and sustainability, he said.
     Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s Executive Director, also briefed and said one of the defining features of the crisis in Haiti is the rampant rights violations against children.  She asked Council members to use all available leverage to protect children, and to demand that all armed groups end attacks on schools and hospitals, immediately release children from their ranks and allow secure, unimpeded access for humanitarian workers to safely reach communities.  And she called on donors to show solidarity with the Haitian people and contribute to funding appeals.  And as you will recall, Haiti is the least funded of all of our humanitarian appeals.
     ** Sustainable Development Goals Advocates
     Also just to announce that the Secretary-General welcomes two new SDG Advocates:  Masai Ujiri, Co-Founder of Giants of Africa and former Vice-Chairman and President of the Toronto Raptors, and also appointed Muniba Mazari, an award-winning advocate for disability rights, inclusion and gender equality.  Mr. Ujiri uses basketball as a transformative tool to create opportunities for youth across Africa and beyond.  And Ms. Mazari uses her voice and platform to champion marginalized communities.  Our Advocates for the SDGs are influential leaders who support the Secretary-General in raising global ambition and action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The group is chaired by Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados.  That’s it.  Gabriel?
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  On the JCPOA, you know we have this 30-day window, as you alluded to.  We all know what happens at the end of September here. Is the Secretary-General thinking… what's his thinking in terms of perhaps convening some diplomacy under his good offices, when all the world leaders are here before that 30-day deadline kicks in?
     Spokesman :  I'm sure this will be an issue raised in a number of bilateral that the Secretary-General will have.  The decision now is up to Security Council members, but I think as I've just stated, there is that window, right? And we hope that all JCPOA participants will use that window to avoid any further escalation.
     Question :  And on UNIFIL, if I may, we've all read the resolution, so I'm not going to ask specifically about that.  But, what is the SG's thinking in terms of 2027?  Is that the wind-down period for the entire year, or how does he view that year?
     Spokesman :  Yeah.  I mean, it goes you know, the mandate will end at the end of 2026, then there is a withdrawal period and then the liquidation period.  I mean, it's sort of standard operating procedure.  We saw it with our Mission in Mali.  That being said, he will present, very soon, options to the Council on how to continue to implement 1701.  I mean, UNIFIL is a key element at this moment in the implementation of 1701.  And as we tell you every day, almost every day, there's progress being made, right?  I mean, the weapons caches, this stability, more or less, but more than less, along the Blue Line since the November ceasefire was agreed upon.  Dezhi?
     Question :  Also on UNIFIL, today in the Security Council chamber, we heard some Member States, they said that some of the mandates of UNIFIL haven't yet to be met, have been failed to meet.  And also Israeli Government obviously criticized UNIFIL also failing of, you know, disarm Hizbullah.  So, I just sort of want to know, what is the Secretary-General's reaction on this?
     Spokesman :  Well, the best way for UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate is for all parties in the conflict to allow it to fulfil its mandate.
     Question :  But oh, sorry… this Monday, I asked you that Secretary-General has a strong preference of not to end the operation, but you said it’s in the wise hands of these members of the Security Council to decide.  What does he think about this result?
     Spokesman :  Listen.  The Council… this is the organization that he runs, right?  The Security Council creates and de-creates peacekeeping missions. They've taken a decision, but let's look on the more positive side:  that there is an extension until the end of 2026.  There will be options presented to the Council on how to continue to implement 1701, because 1701 remains a very relevant resolution and it remains a very relevant part of our effort, along with the parties to bring stability to southern Lebanon.  Stefano Vaccara?
     Question :  Thank you, Stéphane.  This morning when the Secretary-General closed his speech on the stakeout, he says, no, you know, he said no more excuses, no more obstacles, no more lies. What can we know exactly what he was referring about the lies?  Who is…?
     Spokesman :  The truth is one of the first victims of war.  And what we've always repeatedly called for, especially in this conflict, is for journalists to be allowed in to report, to ensure that people know the truth about what is going on.
     Question :  But for the Secretary-General, what is the biggest lie that in this conflict has been?
     Spokesman :  I'm not going to start to rank disinformation.
     Question :  And then another question on what we just saw with the Russian Ambassador and what's going on with the Iran sanctions.  The Russian Ambassador at one point, answering a question, said that the action of Germany, France and UK is equivalent to gangsters.  Must say they’re just gangsters and doing what they're doing.  So, what is the Secretary-General’s opinion on what's going on with Iran in this moment about this issue of sanctions?
     Spokesman :  Well, I think I just shared it with you.
     Correspondent :  Yeah.  But, he's, in this case… I'm just saying, you know, the Russian calling the Germans gangsters…
     Spokesman :  I will be the last person to insert myself in the colourful dialogue between Security Council members.  Yes, please?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  I wanted to ask a slightly different question about the letter sent on behalf of more than 500 OHCHR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] workers to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, chief Volker Türk.  The letter urges the chief to publicly describe the war in Gaza as a genocide, saying his office's failure to do so undermines the global rights-protection system.  Just curious if there were any comments by the SG.
     Spokesman :  I think the High Commissioner has been extremely vocal, extremely strong about what was going on in Gaza.  I can tell you that he has the full and unconditional support of the Secretary-General.  As we've said here repeatedly, for the UN, the labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal authority.  And I think, if you look at the criticism that Mr. Türk has faced from the Israeli Government, I think that should give you a pretty good picture of his position on Gaza.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  And then we'll go to our guests.
     Question :  The US ambassador said that the US and Panama would table a draft resolution on the next Haiti force.  I wanted to know whether this new force is a replacement of the MSS or it's kind of a… what's the format of this new arrangement?
     Spokesman :  My understanding is that this isn't… listen.  Let me take a look at the… I misspoke yesterday when I answered a question on the Council in Iran.  I don't want to do it today, so I'll get you an answer on that.  Alright.  I'd like you to stay in your seats, and I will go get my guest.

6) United Nations Palestinian Rights Committee Bureau Denounces E1 Settlement Plan, Demands Immediate Halt of All Illegal Settlement Activity — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     The following statement was issued today by the Bureau of the General Assembly’s Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People:
     The Bureau of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People rejects and condemns the Israeli Government’s so-called E1 settlement plan in the occupied East Jerusalem.  The approval of over 3,400 illegal housing units in a critical area linking East Jerusalem with Ramallah and Bethlehem, and connecting the northern and southern West Bank, strikes at the heart of Palestinian territorial continuity, severely restricting and violating the freedom of movement and further fragmenting and isolating Palestinian communities.  This illegal plan must be stopped.
     The Committee Bureau demands that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately halt all settlement activities, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and all annexation measures.  The UN Security Council, in its resolution 2334 (2016), declared Israeli settlements flagrant violation under international law demanding Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities.  Moreover, it called on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967, which the Committee Bureau reminds that Israel has absolutely no sovereignty rights in, as affirmed by the International Court of Justice in its 19 July 2024 Advisory Opinion.
     By severing East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, this illegal settlement plan endangers the viability and existence of the Palestinian State and further entrenches Israel’s illegal occupation, paving the way for further forced displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian population.  This blatant land grab constitutes a grave breach of international law and is a direct challenge to decades of international consensus.  It comes at a moment when East Jerusalem is already under siege, with families deprived of their homes, livelihoods and rights and the Palestinian presence in the city endangered.
     The resumption of the High-Level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution at the United Nations on 22 September, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, presents a timely and vital opportunity for decisive action, to reiterate the international community’s steady commitment to the two-State solution and mobilize renewed international support towards ending the Israeli unlawful occupation.  The UN Palestinian Rights Committee stands ready to contribute actively to this effort and strongly supports the objectives of the Conference.  Our goal remains clear:  the full realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, their right to return, and continue contributing to the two-State solution — Israel and an independent, contiguous, viable and sovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 lines, in conformity with the relevant UN resolutions.

7) Amid Relentless Armed Violence, Collapsing Schools, Hospitals, Haiti Facing ‘Perfect Storm of Suffering’, Secretary-General Warns Security Council — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     Amid relentless armed violence, collapsing schools and hospitals, and a worsening humanitarian crisis leaving millions at risk, the UN Chief warned the Security Council today that Haiti faces a “perfect storm of suffering”, with children enduring unprecedented levels of forced recruitment, sexual violence and hunger.
     “Civilians [in Haiti] are under siege,” said Secretary-General António Guterres, stressing that State authority is crumbling as gang violence engulfs Port-au-Prince and spreads beyond — paralysing daily life and forcing 1.3 million people to flee.  Reports detail rape and sexual violence, repeated attacks on hospitals and schools, and the collapse of the rule of law.  With 6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, Haiti ranks among the five global hunger hotspots of “highest concern”.
     Aid workers, especially local responders, face threats of violence, extortion and kidnapping.  Despite the danger, they continue delivering food, water, medicine and shelter — reaching 1.3 million people in the first quarter of this year alone. “Yet, Haiti remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded”, he stressed, noting that $908 million is required in 2025 to support 3.9 million people, yet less than 10 per cent has been received — making Haiti the least-funded humanitarian appeal worldwide. “This is not a funding gap.  It is a life-and-death emergency,” he asserted, urging donors to act before lifesaving operations grind to a halt.
     Citing his annual report on children and armed conflict, he said Haiti ranked among the top five countries for grave violations against children in 2024:  the UN verified 2,269 such violations against 1,373 children — nearly five times more than the previous year.  Children are being abducted, killed, recruited and subjected to horrific sexual violence, including gang rape.  “These are crimes that scar bodies, minds and futures,” he said.  With basic services collapsing and mass displacement worsening, children are left without education, healthcare, or safety.
     The 2024 Handover Protocol between the UN and Haiti’s Government is “an important step” towards protecting children detained for alleged association with armed groups, he said.  However, he warned of the growing threat posed by so-called community self-defence groups — some aligned with police forces — implicated in grave violations, including the summary execution of children.  He urged all authorities to implement the Handover Protocol nationwide.
     While the political situation remains fragile, there are “emerging signals of hope”, including increased cooperation between the President of the Transitional Presidential Council and the Prime Minister, who are leading consultations to advance the political process.  Coordinated international security support, he stressed, is essential to bolster national efforts, protect civilians and create conditions for a return to the rule of law and credible, inclusive elections.
     Welcoming efforts to advance his proposal to strengthen the Multinational Security Support mission through UN logistical and operational support, he urged the Council to swiftly authorize an international force with UN backing and predictable financing.  Security measures, he emphasized, “must go hand-in-hand with increased pressure on those fuelling the violence” through an effective arms embargo and targeted sanctions against gang leaders, financiers and arms traffickers.
     “With unity inside the country, and resolve from this Council, the Haitian people can emerge from the perfect storm, begin to turn hardship into hope, and reclaim their future,” he concluded.
     Presenting a detailed briefing on the grave and widespread violations of children’s rights, Catherine Russell, Executive Director, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said: “Haiti’s children continue to endure unimaginable suffering amidst the brutal armed violence.”  The recruitment and use of children by armed groups is rampant, she stressed, estimating that children currently account for a staggering 50 per cent of the armed groups’ members.  Children are being forced into combat roles, directly participating in armed confrontations, and subjected to appalling sexual violence that has reached “unprecedented levels”.
     In 2024, reported cases of sexual violence against children rose by 1,000 per cent over 2023, she noted, with over a quarter involving gang rapes.  “This constitutes a widespread campaign to terrorize communities and inflict lasting physical and psychological trauma on children,” she said, emphasizing that girls account for most victims and survivors.
     Amid this devastating reality, UNICEF and partners are being denied access to deliver humanitarian assistance.  Armed groups, she said, are preventing aid from reaching the 1.6 million children and women in areas under their control.  Last month, six UNICEF staff members were taken hostage during a lifesaving mission — although later released, the incident highlights the dangers humanitarian workers face.
     Despite these obstacles, UNICEF continues to deliver lifesaving aid.  So far this year, together with partners, it has treated 21,000 children for severe wasting, provided healthcare to 117,000 people and ensured access to safe water for 140,000.  “Today, I ask all Members of this Council to use all available leverage to protect children and to support concrete actions to prevent further violations,” she said.
     Silent Condemnation of Entire Generation of Children
     The Council then heard from Jean Jean Roosevelt, a musician and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, who stated that “armed violence is tearing Haiti apart like a broken guitar whose strings produce nothing but tears and cries”. With armed groups taking over entire neighbourhoods, “children now live in a symphony of fear; every alleyway turned into a dissonant note”.
     These children, he said, pay the heaviest price:  forcibly recruited, abused, and used as cannon fodder, as though their youth no longer held any value.  “Schools, once sanctuaries, have become minefields”, he added, with classrooms destroyed or turned into shelters for displaced families.
     Calling this reality “a silent condemnation of an entire generation”, he noted that over 1.5 million children lack regular access to education; 3.3 million — two out of three — depend on humanitarian aid; and 129,000 risk dying of hunger this year.  “Behind these figures that we repeat aloud over and over, there is a face, a name, a fragile dream:  perhaps that of a little girl who wanted to be a doctor or that of a boy who dreamed of playing the drum at carnival,” he said.  However, “these dreams are now suspended and suffocated”.
     “Let us act so that Haiti may once again have schools, hospitals, and safe spaces; so that children no longer live in fear, but in the promise of tomorrow”, he urged.  Addressing the Council, he pledged:  “The children of Haiti have sounded the alarm, raising a cry of urgency. Will you continue to answer it? For the time to come to their aid is not tomorrow, nor the day after… it is now.”
     In the ensuing debate, delegates voiced alarm over the plight of Haitian children, with the representative of Panama, President for August, speaking in his national capacity, saying:  “Every figure is a story that can still have a different outcome.  A recruited child that can go back to school, a girl who survives violence who can receive attention and justice; a baby with serious, acute malnutrition who can still recover if therapeutic milk reaches them in time; a displaced family that can live without fear.”  On the underfunding of the Haiti humanitarian response plan, he said:  “Not closing this gap is not just a technical statistical matter; it is literally the difference between life and death”.
     Guyana’s representative, also speaking for Algeria, Sierra Leone, and Somalia, echoed concerns over the “faltering” humanitarian response, amidst insecurity and access impediments.  “The situation is also compounded by the rising deportations of Haitian nationals, which place additional strain on already scarce resources,” she said, adding:  “Discussions on safety and security must also address challenges to the safety of humanitarian personnel and the continuity of aid operations.”
     Slovenia’s delegate concurred, pointing out that the growing presence and activities of armed gangs in Haiti’s key rice-basket region are fuelling famine-like conditions and record-high displacement.  Calling for safe humanitarian access to these areas, she said:  “Reducing the territorial control of armed gangs in urban hubs, agricultural areas, and along vital transport routes must be an immediate priority to enable and safeguard food production and its unimpeded transport and delivery.”
     Spotlighting the plight of children, the United States’ delegate echoed other speakers’ condemnation of their recruitment by armed gangs, and outlined measures taken by her country, including its designation of Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists.  Also commending the Council for its recent designation of those groups, she noted the $5 million reward offered for information leading to the arrest of gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, known as Barbecue.
     In a similar vein, the United Kingdom’s delegate pointed out that armed gangs are systematically recruiting minors, fuelling a surge in exploitation, sexual violence and abuse.  “These atrocities spread fear and inflict lasting trauma on Haiti’s young people,” he said, stressing the need to re-establish security for Haiti’s long-term stability and welcoming the Secretary General’s recommendations for enhanced security assistance for Haiti.
     The Dominican Republic’s representative said that Haiti is a litmus test for the Council’s credibility, pointing out that children comprise 30 to 50 per cent of the armed gangs’ ranks through forced recruitment. Emphasizing the need for political will and the restoration of security and the rule of law, he called for the Multinational Security Support Mission to be adequately resourced, for humanitarian assistance to be bolstered, and for the reintegration of minors linked to armed gangs to be guaranteed.
     On the political front, France’s delegate underscored that progress must be made towards a political transition and security conditions established for the holding of elections.  To this end, the Council should use all tools at its disposal, including sanctions, to combat gangs and the transnational criminal network fuelling them.
     Also on the topic, the Russian Federation’s delegate observed that the crisis in Haiti has left “simply no legitimate state authority to speak of”, while transitional mechanisms had not garnered requisite support from Haitians.  Therefore, conditions for the swift holding of elections and general elections in 2026 had not unfortunately been established.  In the areas around the capital, the State is de facto absent and parallel government structures flourish, leading to the intimidation and extortion of the Haitian people.
     The representatives of Greece, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea were among many speakers highlighting the need to support the Multinational Security Support Mission, with the latter calling for the acceleration of discussions on the Secretary-General’s recommendations to ensure they are reflected as concretely as possible in the upcoming resolution on the renewal of the Support Mission’s mandate.  “Only then can we provide the people of Haiti with the clarity and support they urgently need,” he said.
     For his part, China’s delegate called on Haitian authorities to increase security inputs and rationalize resource allocation.  While commending the Support Mission in helping improve the security situation, he called on the country that initiated it and bears primary responsibility for the situation in Haiti to continue to provide funding and support.
     The representative of Barbados, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), called for stronger backing of the Mission as well as the rapid implementation of the Haitian Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan.
     Haiti’s delegate pointed out that while his Government has mobilized resources to help over 200,000 of the most vulnerable families, this is still “largely insufficient”.  Agricultural production often fails to reach urban centers, exacerbating the crisis.  Resolving the humanitarian crisis is inextricably linked to addressing Haiti’s severe security challenges, he said, urging regional and international partners to prioritize support that enables displaced populations to return home and reduces their long-term dependence on aid.
     “The gravity of the situation in Haiti requires a coordinated, integrated and sustainable humanitarian response plan with adequate and sufficient resources to address the multiple challenges,” he stressed.

8) As Gaza Faces Famine, United Nations Committee on Palestinian Rights Urges World Leaders to Back Two-State Solution at General Assembly’s High-Level Session — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     Famine is a reality in Gaza and this “crime against humanity” must be stopped, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People heard today, as speakers underscored the importance to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian cause ahead of the General Assembly’s high-level session in September.
     The discussion underscored the importance of the Assembly’s segment on 22 September in New York, where the presence of Heads of State and Government will be vital to endorse the New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution.
     Riyad Mansour, Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine, citing the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report, stressed: “For the first time, in connection with the United Nations, famine is in fact taking place in the Gaza Strip.”   He called this “a crime against humanity that must be stopped”, and urged large-scale food delivery through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which “has the capacity and the network in all corners of Gaza to do the job they have been doing for a long period of time”.
     Mr. Mansour also condemned Israel’s new military campaign, saying:  “The Government of the occupying authority approved a dangerous plan to unleash massive military force to control completely all parts of Gaza”.  He warned this would demolish Gaza City, forcibly displace half a million people and “expel them completely out of the Gaza Strip in the direction of Sinai”.  He further emphasized:  “We all condemn such a plan, and we are united in demanding it be cancelled and not implemented.”
     Turning to the situation in the West Bank, he decried Israel’s settlement-expansion:  “The illegal approval of thousands of settlement units, known as the so-called E1 project around occupied East Jerusalem, and the annexation of significant portions of the West Bank must be condemned”.  The international community must respond with “consequences and accountability for the Israeli occupying authority”.
     Turning to the International Conference co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, he said the outcome document and annex “reflect a peace plan in line with the historic opinion of the International Court of Justice, which characterized the occupation as illegal and demanded its termination”.  He also urged all countries to endorse the outcome ahead of the September summit:  “We need to reach as many endorsements as possible before resumption of the International Conference”.
     He concluded with urgent demands:  “What we need is an immediate ceasefire, immediate and permanent.” He also highlighted that 14 Security Council members had already called for unimpeded humanitarian access and rejected Israel’s military escalation.  “Peace is good for us, peace is good for everyone, including the Israelis.  It would allow the release of hostages and prisoners, and within 15 months, make the two-State solution a reality on the ground,” he said.
     “The situation remains desperate gravely serious,” said the representative of France on the preliminary outcomes of the High-Level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution.  Famine in Gaza and the ongoing issue of settlements in E1 is “dire enough” to prompt most States to say that the Israeli policy must cease immediately.  “We cannot allow the sanctioning of the destruction of the State of Palestine,” he said.  This is a “key moment” to take long-awaited historical measures, such as the recognition of the State of Palestine, expected in September from several States, including his own.  “It is resoundingly clear that without entering into a political process to support the two-State Solution, it risks never coming to pass,” he said, highlighting the work of 17 participants in eight working groups that presented reports in support of Palestinian sovereignty.  Ahead of the 22 September conference, he voiced hope that more States will support the political declaration put forth at the end of July.
     We cannot underscore the crucial importance of rallying countries to endorse the outcome document and its annex, added the representative of Saudi Arabia.  He expressed hope that the pivotal meeting, scheduled for 22 September, will be held at a high level.  “It is important not just to rally support, but also keep the momentum going,” he stressed.
     Taking the floor for a second time, Mr. Mansour stressed that it is “extremely crucial” that all Heads of State and Government attend the 22 September high-level segment to show solidarity and endorse the New York Declaration on the Two-State Solution, urging “every seat possible filled at the highest level” and wider endorsements beyond the 125 countries and key organizations already on board.
     Mourad Wahba, Director ad interim, UNRWA Liaison Office in New York, briefing the Committee on the latest developments in Gaza, recalled the words of his predecessor, who said last February that the rights of Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territories have never been so jeopardized and violated, and the very Agency which was established by the General Assembly was also in great danger.  UNRWA’s current financial crisis is “of a magnitude we have not seen,” he said, adding:  “Even if the Agency manages to maintain its operations through the end of 2025, the ability to operate in 2026 is at serious risk.”
     In this context, he called for the pushing back against the implementation of the Knesset legislation aimed at the Agency, and against any violation against the privileges and immunities of an UN organization.  He also called for a political path forward that delineates UNRWA’s role as a provider of education and healthcare.  “The Agency is essential for ensuring a viable political transition.”  As well, he called for ensuring that a financial crisis does not abruptly end UNRWA’s life-saving work, adding:  “The Agency cannot continue to operate in the face of extraordinary challenges without adequate resources.”
     Re-taking the floor, Mr. Mansour hailed UNRWA as “a true success story of United Nations multilateralism”, noting that, for millions of Palestinians and Palestinian refugees, “we know what UNRWA has done for our survival, health, lives and education.”  He stressed the Agency’s unique General Assembly mandate, emphasizing it must be allowed to continue its work until a just solution enables refugee return.
     Despite “impossible conditions” in Gaza and relentless pressure from the Israel, UNRWA remains the largest organization on the ground, with most of its staff being Palestinians.  He also underscored its vital role in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, serving refugee communities across the region.  He added that his team had just completed the written submission to the International Court of Justice to support judges in delivering their advisory opinion on the situation in the Strip.
     In other matters, the Committee adopted the annual report of the Committee for submission to the General Assembly (document A/80/35 ), with Jaime Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua), Vice-Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, presenting the annual report.
     The updated draft, he said, reflects recent developments, including “the approval of more illegal settlements in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank”, the confirmation of famine in Gaza and outcomes of the Cairo ministerial conference on humanitarian response.  The report further condemns Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, urges an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access, and calls on Member States to pressure Israel to lift the blockade and end actions that violate international law.

9) Nearing End of Second Session, Preparatory Commission for High-Seas Biodiversity Treaty Discusses Rules of Procedure, Cooperation Arrangements — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     On the penultimate day of its second session, the commission preparing for the entry into force of a new marine biodiversity treaty focused once again on the rules of procedure that will apply to meetings of its Parties, also considering cooperation arrangements with relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies.
     The gathering, formally known as the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”, is taking place at UN Headquarters from 18 to 29 August.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     That treaty was adopted on 19 June 2023 and is open for signature until 20 September 2025.  During the Commission’s meeting on 27 August, it was announced that the Republic of Moldova signed on 26 August and Cabo Verde ratified on 27 August, bringing the total number of signatories to 140 and the total number of ratifications to 54.
     In the morning, the Commission returned to the topic of the rules of procedure for meetings of the Conference of the Parties, guided by a compilation of draft rules prepared by the Co-Chairs (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.3 ).
     Among the many rules discussed, the representative of the Federated States of Micronesia — speaking for Pacific small island developing States — said that the one related to the submission of credentials “could do without the provision” allowing any person authorized by a Head of State, Head of Government or Foreign Minister to issue such credentials, as “it just complicates the procedure”.  On the examination of credentials, the Commission should “stay with precedent” and adhere to the General Assembly’s procedure in this regard, he said.
     However, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, expressed support for the addition of language allowing any person authorized by those high-level individuals to issue credentials to that rule, citing its use in the rules of procedure for the International Criminal Court’s Assembly of States Parties.  He also supported the original language on “examination of the credentials” as it reflects the UN General Assembly’s rules of procedure.
     On another issue — the Conference of the Parties’ Bureau — Argentina’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, favoured one comprising “a President and 15 Vice-Presidents”.  On whether members in arrears can serve on the Bureau, he noted that “issues related to arrears are already mentioned in the financial rules” and suggested referencing those rules instead of adding language to the rules of procedure.  The representatives of the United Kingdom and Norway voiced support for a provision on “penalties for arrears”, similarly noting that a cross-reference to the financial rules could be appropriate.
     Morocco’s representative, speaking for the African Group, said that the Bureau must be sufficiently sized to ensure equitable and inclusive representation — suggesting between 12 and 15 members to this end.  However, he stressed that any formula should not disadvantage “or weaken the voice of developing countries”.  “Our overall objective is a Bureau that is balanced, representative and effective,” he emphasized.
     The representative of the Federated States of Micronesia, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, proposed a Bureau with 17 Vice-Presidents — 15 from the regional groups, 1 from small island developing States and 1 from least developed countries.  Regarding the provision that the President shall not exercise the right to vote, he said that this is correct here.  However, he added that the States for whom he speaks feel differently about the subsidiary bodies, in which a President would be acting in a more personal capacity.
     Singapore’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, stressed that the rules for Bureau officers must “make clear that seats for small island developing States and least developed countries are in addition to the seats allocated to the regional groups”.  To that end, Japan’s delegate also voiced support for a Bureau with 3 members per regional group, plus 1 member each from small island developing States and least developed countries, comprising a total of 17 Vice-Presidents.
     China’s representative, too, expressed support for a Bureau of this size, with representation for small island developing States and least developed countries.  However, he also recommended that proportionality be considered, given “the big difference in the [number of] member States in each regional group”.  On the granting of credentials, he noted that — in the General Assembly’s rules of procedure — “there is no language allowing any other person to grant credentials” than the Head of State or Government or the Foreign Minister.  Allowing other persons to do so, he warned, would further complicate the work of the credentials committee, and give rise to questions around States’ internal procedures.
     For his part, Iran’s delegate supported the highest number allocated for Vice-Presidents in the draft rules, which “shall be from regional groups”.  Noting the draft’s reference to gender balance in the composition of these officers, he stressed that any such reference should be consistent with the Agreement. Regarding the draft provision that would exclude a party from Bureau membership due to arrears in contributions, he noted that it would be unfair to apply this to developing countries.
     The representative of Saudi Arabia called for deleting the entire provision “punishing countries with arrears, since this Agreement is to ensure strengthened cooperation and participation of all State Parties”.  The speaker for the Philippines added that “State Parties that are in arrears should not be deprived of their voting rights”.  Regarding the term limit for the President of the Conference of the Parties, she welcomed the option of a maximum of two — “because it is the clearest guarantee of fairness, inclusivity and rotation”.
     Delegations also addressed the Bureau’s role, underscoring its consultative function.  Türkiye’s representative noted redundant language in the proposed text, but expressed support for retaining the reference to Bureau members “regularly consulting with the Parties from their respective regional groups” in the interest of transparency and inclusiveness.  Noting the provision for a proportional allocation of seats among the UN regional groups, she cautioned that such a formula “could complicate the process and risk undermining inclusiveness — particularly for smaller regional groups”.
     Support for the allocation of special seats for small island developing States and least developed countries, given their unique circumstances, was heard throughout the meeting.  However, Switzerland’s representative stated that, “in principle, sub-groups should be part of the regional representation in the Bureau”, voicing concern that separate seats for sub-groups “would open a dangerous Pandora’s box”.
     While the Commission also addressed rules relating to subsidiary bodies later in the morning, it did not complete its full review of the revised draft rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties during this meeting.  Co-Chair Adam McCarthy (Australia) emphasized that “it is essential to complete this task” during the Commission’s current session, so that a further revised draft can be prepared during the intersessional period.
     In the afternoon, the Commission returned to the issue of cooperation arrangements with relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies.
     Argentina’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, was among those who underscored the role of the Conference of the Parties as the central governing body of the Agreement.  He stressed that, consequently, any cooperation mechanism must ensure that “it is the Conference of the Parties that preserves the coherence, control, oversight and political direction over coordination processes, consultations and technical exchanges carried out by subsidiary bodies with instruments, frameworks and bodies”.  Such activities must operate “within clear mandates emanating from the Conference of the Parties”, he added.
     There was also general support for the development of a draft decision or strategic framework on cooperation.  Tonga’s representative, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, proposed that the Preparatory Commission create such a draft decision and forward it to the Conference of the Parties for consideration and adoption.  She cautioned, however, against referring to such a document as “guiding principles”, as this may result in a negotiation exercise.
     Saint Lucia’s representative, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), added that a strategic framework in line with article 47 of the Agreement — which establishes the Conference of the Parties — would “ensure coherence across regimes, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure efficiency in the use of limited resources”.  The framework would capture the key thematic areas of cooperation, key actors for such collaboration and the various types of arrangements to this end.
     The representative of Côte d’Ivoire, speaking for the African Group, emphasized that cooperation modalities must be aligned with the Agreement’s unique objectives and legal obligations.  Further, they must effectively address the needs and priorities of African developing States, including least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.
     Palau’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, noted that “cooperation goes both ways” — therefore, any cooperation arrangement must be reciprocal.  For its part, the Commission could recommend that the Conference of the Parties invite representatives of relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies to become observers to the Agreement’s institutions.  It could also mandate that the Agreement’s secretariat develop cooperation arrangements, she added.
     The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, emphasized that the Agreement’s secretariat and subsidiary bodies should have significant autonomy when interacting with relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies, with any decision ultimately taken in this respect giving such bodies the flexibility they need to carry out their tasks.
     Following this discussion, the Co-Chairs confirmed that they intend to prepare a draft decision on this topic during the intersessional period for consideration at the Preparatory Commission’s third session.
     The Commission will reconvene on Friday, 29 August, to conclude its second session.

10) Haiti Still ‘Shamefully Overlooked and Woefully Underfunded’, Secretary-General Warns Security Council, Urging Donors to Act Now Before Life-Saving Operations Stop — UN Press (2025-08-28)

     Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council briefing on the humanitarian and child protection situation in Haiti, in New York today:
     I thank Panama for convening this briefing on the humanitarian and child protection situation in Haiti.
     The people of Haiti are in a perfect storm of suffering.  State authority is crumbling as gang violence engulfs Port-au-Prince and spreads beyond — paralysing daily life and forcing families to flee.  Civilians are under siege with appalling reports of rape and sexual violence.  Hospitals and schools are under repeated attack.  The rule of law has collapsed.
     The humanitarian toll is staggering:  1.3 million people — half of them children — have fled their homes.  Six million people need humanitarian assistance.   Haiti is now among the five global hunger hotspots of “highest concern”. Aid workers, especially local responders, are being targeted — facing threats of violence, extortion and kidnapping.
     Let me be clear:  All parties must respect international humanitarian law.  Humanitarian personnel, assets and facilities must be protected.  Despite the danger, humanitarians remain on the ground — delivering food, water, medicine, and shelter.  In the first quarter of this year alone, they reached 1.3 million people.
     Yet, Haiti remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded.  For 2025, we require $908 million to support 3.9 million people.  But less than 10 per cent has been received, making Haiti the least funded humanitarian appeal in the world. As a result, over 1.7 million people risk receiving no assistance at all.  This is not a funding gap.  It is a life-and-death emergency.  I urge all donors to act before lifesaving operations grind to a halt.  Children are bearing the brunt of this crisis.
     In my annual report on children and armed conflict, Haiti ranked among the top five countries for grave violations against children in 2024.  Children are being abducted and killed, recruited and used, and subjected to horrific sexual violence — including gang rape.  These are crimes that scar bodies, minds, and futures.
     The United Nations verified 2,269 grave violations against 1,373 children last year — a nearly fivefold increase from the year before.  This includes 213 children killed, 138 maimed, and 302 children recruited and used.   We also verified 566 cases of sexual violence against minors — including 160 cases of gang rape, underscoring how such crimes are used as a weapon of terror and control.
     Basic services have collapsed.  Mass displacement has left children without education, healthcare, or safety.  As of April, gang violence had interrupted the schooling of 243,000 students.  We verified 154 abductions, 154 attacks on schools and hospitals, and 728 incidents of denial of humanitarian access.
     The 2024 Handover Protocol between the United Nations and the Government of Haiti is an important step towards protecting children detained for alleged association with armed groups.  But implementation remains uneven.
     Conditions at CERMICOL — the Reintegration Center for Minors in Conflict with the Law — are deeply troubling.  I am also alarmed by the rise of so-called community self-defence groups, some aligned with police forces, implicated in grave violations, including summary executions of children.
     I urge all authorities to implement the Handover Protocol nationwide — end the detention of children for alleged association with armed groups; ensure access to specialized services, including for survivors of sexual violence; and guarantee accountability for all perpetrators.
     I call on this Council to prioritize the protection of children.  The political situation remains fragile.   But there are emerging signals of hope.  I am encouraged by growing cooperation between the President of the Transitional Presidential Council, Laurent Saint-Cyr, and the Prime Minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, who are both leading consultations to move the political process forward.
     We are also seeing closer coordination between the Prime Minister’s Task Force, the Haitian National Police, and the Multinational Security Support mission, improving operations on the ground.
     These fragile gains must be protected and expanded.  That requires decisive and coordinated international security support to strengthen national efforts, protect the population and create the conditions for a return to the rule of law and credible, inclusive elections.
     I welcome efforts by members of this Council to advance my 24 February proposal to strengthen the Multinational Security Support mission through UN logistical and operational support.
     I urge the Council to act without delay and authorize an international force, supported by the United Nations through logistical and operational backing, and predictable financing.
     Voluntary contributions to the MSS Trust Fund remain essential, but assessed support would ensure impact and sustainability.  Security measures must go hand-in-hand with increased pressure on those fuelling the violence.  This includes an effective arms embargo, as well as a targeted expansion of sanctions against gang leaders, financiers, arms traffickers, and others connected to them.
     These steps are vital to cut off the weapons and money that sustain chaos.  Enforcement — at ports, borders, and online — must be strengthened, in close coordination with regional partners.  My Special Representative, Carlos Ruiz Massieu, is in Port-au-Prince, working with national and international partners to build consensus at this pivotal moment.
     The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) will continue to support an inclusive political process and work closely with the Haitian National Police, the MSS, and donors to ensure coherent, coordinated assistance.
     I urge all national stakeholders to seize this moment and sustain this spirit of cooperation.  With unity inside the country, and resolve from this Council, the Haitian people can emerge from the perfect storm, begin to turn hardship into hope, and reclaim their future.
     I reaffirm my unwavering solidarity and the determination of the United Nations to stand side by side with the people of Haiti for peace, dignity, and security.

11) Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2790 (2025), Security Council Extends Mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon — UN Press (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16159.doc.htm
   Text:
     The Security Council today extended the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), for a final time until 31 December 2026, and decided that it should start an orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal from that date.
     Unanimously adopting resolution 2790 (2025) (to be issued as document S/RES/2790(2025) ), the Council also demanded the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), reiterated its strong support for full respect for the Blue Line and welcomed the November 2024 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon.
     In further terms, the 15-member organ, noting with grave concerns the continuous violations of this arrangement, including air and drone strikes on Lebanese territory, called on all parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.
     It called on the Government of Israel to withdraw its forces north of the Blue Line, including from the five positions held in Lebanese territory, and called on the Lebanese authorities to deploy on these positions with the timebound support of UNIFIL, and to extend the control of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory in accordance with relevant resolutions and accords, so that as soon as possible there will be no weapons besides those of and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon.
     In the ensuing discussion, that country’s delegate welcomed the mandate renewal, while adding:  “Lebanon still considers UNIFILS’s presence as essential to guarantee security” in the country and region, until a comprehensive political solution is reached.  Stressing the importance of the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from his country’s territory, he said the international community must support his Government in establishing its authority.
     The continued Israeli targeting of Lebanon, including its infrastructure and civilians, and the prevention of displaced persons from returning to their homes violates international law, he said — despite this, his Government has taken steps to assert full State authority over its territory.  He called on the Council to uphold its legal responsibility and hold Israel accountable for its violations; further, those countries that are guaranteeing the cessation of hostilities arrangement must compel Israel to respect it.  He also called on the UN and its agencies to provide comprehensive support to the Lebanese army and institutions, both bilaterally and multilaterally.
     On the other hand, the representative of Israel said that “UNIFIL has failed in its mandate”.  Its presence has not prevented Hizbullah from “building one of the world’s most dangerous arsenals”, overlooking vast military buildup discovered across southern Lebanon — “some alarmingly close to UNIFIL positions”. In its annual reporting, UNIFIL rarely names Hizbullah “and frequently downplays its activities”, he stated.
     “Israel will continue to do whatever is necessary to defend its people”, with the Israel Defense Forces maintaining presence at five strategic locations along the Blue Line, he stressed.  The Council has “ignored the root cause”, he said, calling on it to hold Iran accountable for “its unspeakable war crimes”.  He stressed the need for a new course that empowers the Lebanese State, holds Hizbullah and Iran to account and restores the authority of Council resolutions.  “After 47 years of what was meant to be an interim presence”, UNIFIL is concluding its mandate on the border between Israel and Lebanon — this is a “decisive moment for Lebanon, Israel and the region”, he stressed.
     Along similar lines, the delegate of the United States said that “the first ‘I’ in UNIFIL stands for interim”.  The time has come for UNIFIL’s mission to end, she said, adding that this is the last time her delegation will support an extension.  “The security environment in Lebanon is radically different” from what it was one year ago, she added, and there is now space for Lebanon to assume greater responsibility.  Her country will support Lebanon’s efforts to assume its security responsibilities, she said, voicing support for Israel’s right to defend itself.
     Despite voting in favour, several delegates expressed reservations.  Algeria’s delegate, who noted that UNIFIL was created in 1978 to observe and confirm Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, said:  “Has UNIFIL fulfilled its mandate?  Clearly the answer is no.”  Lebanese land remains under Israeli occupation, he said, highlighting Israel’s many violations of international law.  The Council must be ready to revisit this resolution considering future developments, he said, regretting that his delegation’s request to refer to the 1949 General Armistice Agreement was not retained.  China’s delegate regretted that “the stubborn insistence of a permanent member” has resulted in the last renewal of UNIFIL’s mandate.  No mission should withdraw in haste while the situation remains tense, he added.
     The Russian Federation’s delegate said the interests of the Lebanese were not fully reflected in this text and warned that it should not create a “security vacuum” in southern Lebanon.
     For the United Kingdom, that country’s delegate said, it was “disappointing that despite the best efforts of the penholder”, the 15-member organ was unable “to make this significant decision on the basis of an evidence-based assessment of the impact of UNIFIL’s withdrawal”.  Pakistan’s delegate reminded delegates that Lebanon did not request the withdrawal of UNIFIL.
     The representative of Greece added:  “While in principle we believe that the ending of the mandate should have been condition-based and the text is not ideal, we stress that UNIFIL’s transition needs to be safe and orderly in close coordination with the host country.”
     France’s delegate, who sponsored today’s resolution, said a premature withdrawal could undermine Beirut’s efforts.  However, he added, “the precious time” afforded by the mandate renewal will be crucial for Lebanon’s Government to assume its authority over its territory.  The representative of the Republic of Korea, a troop-contributor to UNIFIL, highlighted “the Lebanese Government’s sheer will to rise as the sole guarantor of its national security, which gave us confidence to vote in favour of this resolution”.  Also welcoming the text were the representatives of Denmark, Slovenia and Somalia, with the latter calling on Israel to cease its daily air and drone strikes.
     The representative of Panama, Security Council president for August, speaking in his national capacity, voiced strong support for UNIFIL’s peacekeeping personnel, whose presence has “contributed significantly to helping the Lebanese armed forces establish safer conditions for civilians.  Looking towards the last stage of the Force’s work, he expressed trust that conditions in southern Lebanon “will positively evolve towards lasting stability”.

     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
     Good afternoon.
     ** Guest Tomorrow
     Tomorrow, we will have a guest.  Please be here, and we’ll be on our best behaviour.  Our guest will be Edem Wosornu, the Director of Operations and Advocacy at OCHA, who will brief you on her recent travels to Sudan, and will bring you firsthand account of the dire situation there.  Also, tomorrow, the Secretary-General will brief the Security Council in person on the appalling humanitarian situation in Haiti. Prior to his briefing at the Security Council, I expect him to come to the stakeout to speak to you and to take a few questions about the situation in Gaza.  We will confirm it, but you can pencil it in for about 9:45 a.m., 9:40 a.m. tomorrow morning.
     ** Security Council/Middle East
     Speaking of the Security Council, this morning the Security Council held its monthly meeting on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question.  Briefing the Council members via videoconference were Ramiz Alakbarov, our Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, and Joyce Msuya, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator.
     They both expressed their ongoing deep concern about the situation on the ground in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  Mr. Alakbarov described the situation in Gaza as one that is sinking deeper into disaster, with mass displacement, high human casualties and now famine.  Hostages held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups continue to languish in appalling conditions, Mr. Alakbarov reminded Council members.  He urged all sides to put an end to this brutal war immediately.
     Ms. Msuya, for her part, called for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access through all entry points into Gaza and to all people in need across the Gaza Strip.  She said that, in order to meet the needs of 2.1 million hungry and starving people, we need to bring in and deliver greater volumes of life-saving assistance. We need the restrictions on essential items to be lifted.  And we need to halt the delays and the denials that impede and hamper our work on the ground every single day.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     Turning to the situation in the ground.  Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that ongoing strikes have intensified especially in and around Gaza City, killing and injuring people, causing destruction and forcing displacement.  While some medicines and medical supplies have reached Gaza, medical equipment and spare parts, which are items subject to Israeli restrictions, are urgently needed.  As we said yesterday, hospitals are reporting shortages of blood, placing more lives at risk as hospitals continue to receive mass casualties.  Colleagues working on water, sanitation and hygiene warn that access to water remains extremely limited.
     With the majority of infrastructure destroyed over the course of the war, the entry of spare parts, generators and equipment must be facilitated so it is to rehabilitate critical water facilities.  Partners have also noted that ongoing operations in northern Gaza and the recent displacement orders mean that people could be forced away from areas where facilities indispensable for their survival are actually accessible.  The facilities themselves could also be damaged or destroyed.
     Meanwhile, multiple organizations’ attempts to bring shelter items into the Gaza Strip are being rejected by the Israeli authorities. As we repeatedly said here, many tents and tarpaulins that are being used by civilians who are being forced to move and been displaced multiple times, those items have worn out and must urgently be replaced.  In addition, high tides overnight have submerged tents on the beach, which impacted about 200 families, according to what our colleagues are telling us.  Tents and other shelter equipment must be allowed into all parts of Gaza, including directly to northern Gaza and into Gaza city, where they are desperately needed.
     And just to mention an occasion that is supposed to be a happy one in the lives of children and their families: the new school year is approaching.  Gazan children for the third consecutive year will miss this occasion. Education is a fundamental right, and no child should be denied this right.  Access to education must be protected, it must be restored, as the current crisis threatens the future of an entire generation of children in Gaza.
     Our mine action partners also tell us that the expansion of military operations in Gaza will put more people at risk of harm due to explosive ordnance.  Explosive ordnance risk education is an important part of ensuring people’s safety, and partners continue to offer these sessions to communities and carry out explosive hazard assessments to reduce the risks to all aid workers.  Finally, we reiterate once again that a permanent ceasefire and an immediate and unconditional release of all hostages being held in Gaza and those arbitrarily detained remains paramount.
     ** Lebanon/Israel
     Moving north.  Our peacekeeping colleagues in southern Lebanon tell us that they observed this week continued Israel Defense Forces military activities in their areas of operations, including shelling and mortar fire from south of the Blue Line, and that impacted various parts of their area of operations.  Yesterday, peacekeepers observed 58 IDF [Israel Defense Forces] vehicles in the Kfar Kila area of Sector East.
     Peacekeepers continue to also encounter aggressive behavior, which is hampering their mandate implementation.  On Monday, IDF soldiers aimed a machine gun at a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) patrol in Sector East.  Separately, a group of individuals in Sector West pelted stones at UNIFIL vehicles.  We reiterate that any intimidation and interference with UNIFIL’s work must stop.
     Also, on Monday, UNIFIL peacekeepers made a significant discovery of weapon caches in Sector East, finding dozens of rockets and rocket launchers, their fuses, as well as warheads.  Mortar fuses and two mortar firing positions were also found in Sector West.  Since the cessation of hostilities in November 2024, peacekeepers have discovered and reported approximately 320 unauthorized weapon caches and infrastructure to the Lebanese Armed Forces.
     Meanwhile, UNIFIL peacekeepers have assisted in rehabilitating roads damaged in the recent hostilities.  Last week, they cleared the roads between Kfar Kila and Adeisseh in Sector East, improving mobility for the Lebanese Army, for local residents, and of course, for the peacekeepers themselves.
     ** Sudan
     Turning to Sudan.  Of course, as I mentioned, you will hear much more about Sudan tomorrow from Edem [Wosornu, the Director of Operations and Advocacy at OCHA].  But, I can tell you that the already dire situation in North Darfur continues to worsen at an alarming rate.
     Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that after more than 500 days under siege, the state capital El Fasher has become the epicentre of suffering for children, with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warning that malnutrition, disease and violence are claiming young lives every single day.  The agency says that an estimated 260,000 civilians, half of them children, remain trapped inside the city in dire conditions, having been cut off from humanitarian assistance for over 16 months.
     Meanwhile, acute malnutrition is spreading fast.  UNICEF says that more than 10,000 children in El Fasher have been treated for acute severe malnutrition since January.  That’s nearly double the figures for last year.  But, the depletion of supplies has now forced the suspension of services.  Recent reports indicate that at least 63 people, mostly women and children, died of malnutrition in a single week.
     This comes as cholera continues to spread in North Darfur, with our partners reporting more than 7,000 cases there as of Monday.  The outbreak is expanding across the Darfur region and also in the south-eastern State of Blue Nile, where more than 3,000 cases of cholera have been recorded.  We and our partners have scaled up support for the cholera response, including medical supplies and water, sanitation and hygiene assistance, which has helped contain the outbreak.  However, new cases are emerging in remote communities where access to healthcare is limited.
     Meanwhile, heavy rains are making roads between south and east Darfur impassable and disrupting the delivery of medical supplies to affected areas.  We and our partners remain committed to delivering assistance wherever it is accessible.  However, insecurity, bureaucratic and logistical impediments, and severe underfunding continue to hinder our humanitarian operations.  We reiterate our urgent call, which unfortunately, in all too often seems to fall on deaf ears, to all parties to uphold international humanitarian law, guarantee safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers, and prioritize the protection of civilians.
     ** Security Council
     And just for the record, I want to flag that yesterday afternoon, the Security Council convened for a briefing on Threats to International Peace and Security. Briefing Council members, was our friend Miroslav Jenča, the Assistant Secretary-General in the Political Affairs and Peacebuilding Department, noted that nearly three years have passed since the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022.  Mr. Jenča pointed out that as we stated in previous briefings on this topic, any intentional damage to critical civilian infrastructure is of serious concern, and such incidents should be condemned and investigated.  He stressed that the protection of civilian infrastructure and security of international waters is critical for regional commerce, security, and stability.
     ** World Lake Day
     Lastly, we have a new international day on the books, because we don’t have enough of those.  What international day is today?  Exactly, it is World Lake Day.  Congratulations.  Did you know that there are over [117 million] lakes on this planet, ranging in size from tiny ponds to massive inland seas.  Lakes support a wide range of plant and animal species and millions of people rely on lakes as a primary source of clean water.  But, unfortunately, they are affected by a combination of overuse, pollution and climate change.  This awkward silence means that you can now ask a question.  Yes, Dezhi.
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Just a completely non-current-affairs question.  Now, currently in China, many people they are, you know, talking about how to, you know, having meetings and things in the UN.  Is it possible for individuals to rent a UN conference room here in New York?
     Spokesman :  There are processes through which accredited NGOs and Member States can use rooms, or guidelines for that, and there are processes through which groups can also rent out the catering facilities.  We sometimes have weddings, celebrations.
     Question :  Weddings?
     Spokesman :  Yes.  Not during the General Assembly, and I've yet to hear of a proposal during a press briefing. But, in all seriousness, there are procedures for that.  And of course, the fact that an NGO or group rents out space does not in any way imply, that it is sponsored or agreed upon by the UN Secretariat.
     Question :  Not endorsed?
     Spokesman :  Endorsed.  That's the word I was looking for.  Thank you, Dezhi.  Michelle Nichols.
     Question :  Thanks, Steph.  Israel said it's going to add two aid distribution centres in southern Gaza, taking it to a total of five.  Do you have any comment on that?
     Spokesman :  More aid distribution centres, the better.  The UN was operating at some point, and our partners, about 400.  We were operating about 400.  So, I think that, again, we welcome any additional humanitarian distribution points. What we would like to see is an increase in our ability to do our work along with our partners.  Señor?
     Question :  Steph, a question on Venezuela.  Yesterday, the Venezuelan Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ivan Hill, requested the intervention of the Secretary-General in order to restore sanity regarding the deployment of US naval forces in the coast of Venezuela.  Has he responded to…?
     Spokesman :  We know there was a meeting, I think, yesterday in Caracas.  We're waiting to see the actual letter, and then we'll comment on it when we see it.  Yvonne Murray, welcome back.
     Question :  Thanks indeed.  Tell me, what do you know about UNIFIL and when the vote is going to happen?  Do you have any more information than I have?
     Spokesman :  How about you do this, tell me what information you have, and then I could tell you what information I have.
     Correspondent :  I actually don't have any.  So, any information is…
     Spokesman :  I’m calling your bluff.  Yes.  My understanding is that we will see a vote by the end of the week, but, obviously, I say that under the reserve that the scheduling of votes is firmly in the hands of the Security Council.  We very much hope we will see a renewal of the mandate.  I mean, we keep underscoring and I think illustrating every day, the critical work that UNIFIL is doing in implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), and in supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces to reassert their full authority South of the Litani River, and we hope they're able to continue to do that.
     Question :  And is the Secretary-General carrying out advocacy behind closed doors?  And if so, in what form?
     Spokesman :  I think all Member States are very clear as to what our position is, which is basically in the report.  But, I have nothing to share with you further.  Amelie then Abdelhamid and then Alex.
     Question : A follow-up on UNIFIL.  The last draft is trying to extend the mission for another sixteen months until the end of 2026 and acting that the withdrawal will start at the beginning of 2027, within a year.  So, even if it's extending it, it's acting the end of it. So what would be the reaction of the Secretary-General, if the council decide that he cannot leave for more than another year?
     Spokesman :  I think Amelie, you've been around these halls for some time.  You know that the last thing we will want to do is interject ourselves in the negotiations of a resolution.  I think, as I said, the Secretary-General's position is well known.  Let's wait to see what is passed, and then we'll comment on it, maybe.  Abdelhamid.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Do you have any UN objective evaluation of the air dropping of food in Gaza?  Is it helping?  Is it increasing the level of chaos and disorder?  What is it?
     Spokesman :  Again, I think, you know, we've always said that airdrops are a solution of last resort in any humanitarian situation, because they're extremely costly.  They're dangerous.  But, you know, I think we try to put ourselves, we have to put ourselves in the shoes, if possible, of those who are waiting for the food.  They pose some danger.  We've seen it but obviously, they do bring some help.  Our message is that there's a whole better system, right? There's a system that's worked.  It worked, during the ceasefire that occurred earlier this year.  We've been very public about it.  Let us do our work.  Let the international NGOs that work in cooperation with us do our work, and that way there will be no need for risky and costly airdrops.  Alex?
     Question :  Thanks, Steph.  I got a couple questions on Iran.  Firstly, IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors have arrived in Iran, have returned to Iran.  Can you comment?
     Spokesman :  No.  I've seen the news that was announced by the IAEA as, again, we hope that Iran will fully cooperate with the IAEA and live up to its obligations with the IAEA.
     Question :  One more, if I may.  So, just a technical question.  If European countries, European leaders decide to trigger the snapback mechanism, are they required to notify the Secretary-General or not?
     Spokesman :  My understanding of the process is that a there would need to be a letter to the Secretary-General.  I hope that understanding is correct.  [The workings of the so-called Snapback can be found in Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), the Spokesman later added.]  Abdelhamid.
     Question :  Second question.  Did you see the comment made by Tom Barrack, the US ambassador in Lebanon, addressing the journalists as animalistic and chaos.  And he said, if you be continue to behave like that, I'm going to dismiss you or I'm going to leave.  What is your comment on that?
     Spokesman :  My comment is that I treat all the journalists I deal with the utmost respect, and everyone should.  Madame?
     Question :  With regards to COP30 [thirtieth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], there have been a lot of concerns coming out about particularly with logistics, whether Belem is well equipped or well suited to host the expected number of delegations that are expected to be sent.  But, there've already been talks about certain countries, certain delegations decreasing the numbers in their delegations to send over to Belem this year. My question is the Secretary-General concerned with that impact that there may be fewer people involved in COP30 this year?
     Spokesman :  Well, we're fully aware of the challenges that the Brazilian hosts are facing.  We hope that a lot of these things will be worked out.  It is critical that for this COP and any other COP, that there is a large civil society participation, that Member States should be able to bring whomever they want and what they can afford.  But, it is important to hear the voices of the people in these COPs.  And other COPs have had challenges on that front, as well, for different reasons, but we hope that voices of civil society can be heard.
     Question :  What about within the UN system themselves?  Was it possible for even UN delegations, within the UN system will also be affected by…?
     Spokesman :  We're trying to work all that out in a cost-efficient manner.  Okay.  On that note, see you tomorrow.

     The following statement was issued today by the Bureau of the General Assembly’s Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People:
     A new Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis officially confirmed famine in Gaza Governorate, with more than half a million people facing starvation, destitution, and preventable death.  “The Gaza Famine”, as the UN relief chief called it, is only getting worse.  If nothing is done to end the Israeli blockade and to ensure immediate and unfettered humanitarian aid to the Palestinian civilian population, famine is projected to spread to Deir al‑Balah and Khan Younis in the coming weeks.  This catastrophic man-made disaster comes on the heels of two years of near total Israeli destruction and blockade of Gaza and relentless military assaults that have decimated civilian infrastructure, including food production capacities and all other means of subsistence.
     The Bureau of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People condemns in strongest terms this deliberate use of deprivation and starvation by Israel, the occupying Power, as a weapon against the Palestinian people.  This is a grave breach of international law.  States must act without delay to fulfil their legal obligations towards bringing a rapid end to this catastrophe and illegal situation as a whole.
     This is not an abstract crisis.  It is an intentionally engineered disaster.  Infrastructure has been destroyed, aid is being blocked or manipulated, and children are dying from lack of therapeutic food and fortified milk.  By 15 August, 240 Palestinian deaths were reported attributed to starvation, malnutrition or famine, including 107 children and 133 adults.  Over 70,000 children urgently need therapeutic food, yet only a tiny fraction are receiving it.  More rare preventable diseases are now spreading in Gaza due to starvation and lack of medical supplies.
     The Committee Bureau demands an immediate and permanent ceasefire, full and unhindered humanitarian access to all parts of Gaza, and the rapid mobilization of international resources for food, nutrition and medical care for the Palestinian civilian population.  Those responsible for obstructing aid and targeting civilians must be held accountable.  Every day of inaction is a day of terror which deepens the suffering and survival of the Palestinian people and pushes Gaza further into utter annihilation.  There is no justification for inaction.  The international community has a legal and moral obligation to intervene.  The Bureau reiterates the need for prompt International Court of Justice action, as requested by the General Assembly on 19 December 2024, to urgently deliver an Advisory Opinion on the humanitarian obligations of Israel, the occupying Power, to avert further Palestinian suffering.  The deliberate starvation of a population is a crime that must be stopped now.

14) Gaza’s Population Systematically Being Starved to Death, Speakers Warn Security Council, Demanding Immediate Ceasefire, End to Deliberate Famine — UN Press (2025-08-27)

     The situation in Gaza is catastrophic, with the worst-case scenario of famine now officially declared and Israel using starvation as a method of war “in its starkest terms”, speakers warned the Security Council today, among them the head of Save the Children International, who implored, Gaza’s “children have reached their breaking point.  Where is yours?”
     “Today the world looks on in horror as the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to deteriorate to levels not seen in recent history,” said Ramiz Alakbarov, United Nations Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process.
     Twenty-two months into the hostilities, Gaza faces “rapidly mounting civilian casualties, mass displacement, and, now, famine”, he said. Moreover, hostages remain in “appalling conditions”, while the West Bank is gripped by “relentless expansion of settlements, demolitions, and intensifying violence”.
     Since 23 July, “at least 2,553 Palestinians were killed,” including 271 while trying to collect aid. Journalists are also under assault; 240 have been killed, including six during a 10 August strike.  And on 25 August, an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital killed 20 civilians.  “I reiterate the Secretary-General’s call for an independent and impartial investigation,” Mr. Alakbarov stressed.
     “Ending famine is a race against time,” requiring restoration of “water, sanitation, health services, and food production”, he continued. Israeli steps such as limited pauses and expanded supply approvals are “nowhere near sufficient”, he said, adding:  “All parties must allow rapid, safe, unimpeded, and large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid”.
     On hostages, he said that 50 remain in captivity and their ill-treatment and abuse constitute a blatant violation of international law.  Turning to the West Bank, he said that Government approvals for 3,400 housing units threaten the possibility of a viable and contiguous Palestinian State.
     “On 22 August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Famine Review Committee confirmed that famine is now occurring in Gaza,” Joyce Msuya, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, told the Council.
     Over half a million people currently face starvation, destitution and death,” with projections of 640,000 within weeks, she added.  At least 132,000 children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition, with over 43,000 at risk of death.  For pregnant and breastfeeding women, numbers are surging from 17,000 to 55,000.
     “It’s a created catastrophe,” she went on, citing 22 months of restricted aid, destroyed cropland and decimated livestock. Overcrowding and collapsed water and sanitation systems have also “turned menstrual hygiene into a nightmare for women and girls”.
     International law, she reminded, “prohibits the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”.  Turning to the West Bank, she echoed Mr. Alakbarov’s warning that “settler violence, and discriminatory policies” threaten 18 Bedouin communities with displacement.
     “As we speak children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death,” said Inger Ashing, Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children International.  The Gaza famine is a deliberate policy — engineered and manmade — in which Israel is using “starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms”.
     Clinics are “almost silent now”, filled with emaciated children who “do not have the strength to speak or even cry out in agony”, she said.  Supplies lie blocked at the border — “thousands upon thousands of truckloads of lifesaving items”.   Increasingly, children “wish for food, for bread”, and some wish “to be dead”, with one child writing:  “I wish I was in heaven where my mother is, in heaven there is love, there is food and water”.
     Ms. Ashing stressed that famine is “the predictable result of a policy of a sustained siege on food, medicine and fuel”, echoing Ms. Msuya’s assessment that at least 132,000 children under five are at risk of acute malnutrition — twice the number in May 2025.  “This is the predictable result of obstruction”, as non-governmental organizations face rejected requests and new registration rules that are “unlawful, unsafe, and incompatible with humanitarian principles”.  Gazan families are also now calling militarized food distribution points “the jaws of death”, she said.
     “Palestinian children are the only ones in the world systematically prosecuted in military courts,” she pointed out.  They report abuse and starvation while in custody.  For almost two years, the international community has failed to protect Palestinian children — who are now at their breaking point.  “Where is yours?” she asked Council members.
     Ilana Gritzewsky, held in captivity in Gaza for 55 days, spoke to the Council next, saying:  “I was born in Mexico to a Jewish family deeply connected to Israel”.  Ms. Gritzewsky had moved to Israel and lived with her partner, Matan, in Kibbutz Nir Oz.  On 7 October 2023 “that life was destroyed” when “terrorists stormed our home; Matan held the door as we hid, but they broke in”.
     “I was dragged away, beaten, humiliated, and taken to Gaza,” she recalled. For 55 days she endured captivity.  “I suffered broken bones, constant abuse, starvation.  We were given scraps of food while our captors ate full meals.  We were moved from house to house, then to tunnels,” she told Council Members. There she discovered that Matan had also been captured.
     Released after several weeks, Ms. Gritzewsky said she carries deep scars.  “Trauma doesn’t vanish once you are released,” she added.
     With Matan still in Gaza, she urged the Council:  Use your power to demand the unconditional release of every hostage now. “Only then can we begin to heal and believe again in the values this Council was created to uphold,” she said.
     The Observer for the State of Palestine said famine, now declared in Gaza City, is rapidly engulfing the entire Gaza Strip and “eating away at infants and children”.  He condemned the strike on Nasser Hospital as “premeditated”, targeting medics and journalists who had rushed to assist after the initial attack — calling it part of a broader plan to displace the Palestinian people and seize their land.
     Emphasizing that “the only path to a peaceful, stable, and secure future goes through Palestine”, he reaffirmed Palestine’s readiness to work with the United States, Saudi Arabia, France, and other international and regional partners to ensure post-ceasefire arrangements address all legitimate concerns in line with international law and relevant UN resolutions. “Palestine will not disappear.  Israel will not disappear.  No one can kill their way to peace,” he concluded.
     Amid the official declaration of famine in Gaza, many speakers sounded the alarm over Israel’s expansion of military operations in the Strip.
     “The famine that we have all feared is now a confirmed fact in Gaza City, and it is expected to affect more areas by September,” said Denmark’s delegate, urging Israel to immediately change course and allow immediate, large-scale, unobstructed multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance.
     “Over 100 children in Gaza have died of malnutrition, while food is sitting at Gaza’s borders,” said the United Kingdom’s delegate. Somalia’s delegate added that “entire families are starving in full view of this Council”, despite the presence of an international humanitarian system that could save them if “only they were allowed to act”.
     Picking up that thread, Greece’s delegate noted that her country, in coordination with the European Union, Jordan, and other regional partners, had recently conducted an airdrop of food supplies over Gaza.  She also welcomed the resumption of the Cyprus corridor, a critical component of the humanitarian pipeline, expressing hope it would accelerate the delivery of aid.
     China’s delegate reiterated that “violence cannot bring security”, citing the attack on Nasser Hospital as “yet another horrendous tragedy”.  He condemned the weaponization of humanitarian aid and the militarization of its distribution, urging Israel to fulfil its obligations as the occupying Power by opening all border crossings and fully restoring humanitarian access.
     The representative of the Russian Federation concurred, noting that during the Nasser Hospital attack, “a cynical double-tap strike was used when rescue workers arrived”.  He further warned against the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which he described as “a pseudo-humanitarian structure”, pointing out that since it began operating in May 2025, 1,800 Palestinians have died while trying to obtain assistance.
     The representative of Panama, Council President for the month, spoke in his national capacity to denounce the double strike at Nasser Hospital as “a dual direct affront on human dignity and international law”.
     France’s delegate added that such operations will “in no way” ensure Israel’s security”, while firmly rejecting all forced displacement of civilians in Gaza.
     Numerous Council members stressed that the attack at the Nasser Hospital formed part of a repeated pattern of strikes and the incessant killing of civilians, medical staff and journalists.
     With each Council’s convening to address the Gaza conflict, “we are confronted with new depths of suffering”, said Sierra Leone’s representative.  What is unfolding in Gaza, he stressed, constitutes not only a systematic pattern of atrocity crimes but also “a systematic assault on truth itself”.  The Secretary-General has been vilified simply for speaking the truth.  The UN and its agencies have faced baseless accusations, journalists and media workers have paid with their lives in unprecedented numbers, and medical personnel have been attacked in clearly marked facilities and ambulances, with independent experts describing it as “a war on healthcare”.
     Guyana’s delegate voiced concern over the fate of professionals in Gaza, highlighting that doctors and other medical staff lack access to Israeli visas, while many have been killed or injured in hospital attacks.
     Calling for full accountability, the Republic of Korea’s representative urged transparent, independent investigations into all possible violations of international humanitarian law.  “A mere inquiry is not enough”, he stressed, noting that “a series of investigations” has yielded “no concrete measures” since the war began.
     “The suffering in Gaza has reached a level of barbarity that defies imagination,” said Algeria’s delegate, asking:  “Will this Council persist as a theatre of lamentation, endlessly echoing speeches while Gaza burns for lack of action?”
     Warning that each day of inaction risks making the Council “complicit in the suffering that continues to unfold”, Slovenia’s representative similarly questioned:  “What military necessity can justify the killing of a journalist, a doctor, a humanitarian worker?”
     Describing the deliberate destruction of civilian life in Gaza as “mass carnage”, Pakistan’s delegate recalled that the Organization of Islamic Cooperation recently adopted a resolution urging the Council, with “moral clarity”, to act under Chapter VII to halt the aggression and violations by the Israeli occupation.
     While recognizing that “hunger is a real issue in Gaza”, the United States’ representative questioned the credibility of the recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report.  The international community has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into Gaza over the years, while turning a blind eye to the fact that it was facilitating Hamas’ creation of a terrorist stronghold.  The Israel Defense Forces concluded that six Hamas members were killed when it struck the site “Hamas was using to monitor troops at the hospital”, she added.
     Addressing Ilana Gritzewsky, Israel’s representative said:  “You are the living reminder of the unbearable suffering still endured by the hostages.” He noted that the recent report on sexual violence in armed conflict confirmed Hamas’ use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, stressing that “survivors deserve action, not doubt” and urging the Council to blacklist Hamas and formally designate it as a terrorist organization.
     On the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification’s “fabricated report”, he said it “lowered its own threshold to manufacture the so-called famine”, employing flawed methods while disregarding broader data that did not support its findings.  He further pointed out that across its 50 pages, “the word Hamas is not mentioned once”.
     Amid what he called “empty UN statements” and “meaningless summits”, he said “you leave the real work for us”, reiterating Israel’s commitment to “dismantle Hamas’ war machine”.

15) As Marine Biodiversity Treaty’s Entry into Force Draws Closer, Preparatory Commission Continues Second Session — UN Press (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     The commission tasked with preparing for the entry into force of a high-seas biodiversity treaty continued its second session today, returning to a discussion on the financial rules that will govern its eventual secretariat and subsidiary bodies as many delegates emphasized the needs and special circumstances of developing countries in this context.
     The gathering, formally known as the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”, is taking place at UN Headquarters from 18 to 29 August. The second of three planned sessions, it will build on the first session’s work that took place from 14 to 25 April by addressing a series of issues in the format of informal working groups.  (Previous coverage is available here .)
     The Agreement addresses marine genetic resources; measures such as area-based management tools; environmental-impact assessments; and capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.  It was adopted on 19 June 2023 and is open for signature until 20 September 2025.  During today’s meeting, it was announced that the Republic of Moldova signed on 26 August and Cabo Verde ratified on 27 August, bringing the total number of signatories to 140 and the total number of ratifications to 54.
     In the morning, the Commission discussed the financial rules governing the funding of the Conference of the Parties, the secretariat and any subsidiary bodies established under the Agreement.  In doing so, delegates were aided by a document — drafted by the Commission’s Co-Chairs — containing draft rules to that effect (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.4 ).
     Addressing draft provisions on a budget, Iran’s delegate affirmed that “it is important to fully consider the requirements of developing countries” as he recalled that the Agreement itself contains this language.  Further, he noted that the finance committee on financial resources — to be established under the Agreement, and mentioned in the draft rules — is also responsible for needs-assessment, particularly for developing State Parties.
     On that, Oman’s representative called for ensuring an objective basis on which to determine those needs.  “Drawing on the UN financial rules would ensure a high level of efficiency, efficacy and transparency,” he emphasized.  He also suggested looking to the Convention on Biological Diversity as a model and underlined the need for stronger representation of developing countries to improve governance and promote inclusive participation.
     Meanwhile, the Philippines’ delegate stressed the importance of respecting the principles of equity, transparency and accountability when developing the financial rules.  Based on the first of those, “we are leaning towards a more conservative position of a minimum 10 per cent among the options presented for the transfers between appropriation lines”, he said, adding that too much flexibility could cause funds earmarked for developing States’ participation, capacity-building or technology transfer to be diverted elsewhere.
     On structural matters, Nigeria’s delegate, speaking for the African Group, welcomed the draft language establishing a clear relationship between the secretariat preparing the budget and the finance committee, which also looks at the budget and reports to the Conference of the Parties.  He also took note of the phrase that “any expected miscellaneous income shall be estimated conservatively” when the secretariat’s head prepares a budget proposal each financial period, calling for further clarification in this context.
     Saint Lucia’s representative, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), emphasized that the finance committee’s role “should remain strictly advisory”, and that the financial rules “should make clear that the Conference of the Parties retains full authority over budgetary and financial decisions”.  In that regard, she proposed that the draft financial rules specify that “the budget may be shared with the finance committee for technical input, but shall be transmitted directly to all Parties at least 90 days prior to the Conference of the Parties for consideration”.
     Papua New Guinea’s representative, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, noted that his delegation’s position might be even more cautious than CARICOM’s.  While numerous draft provisions are modelled after the International Seabed Authority’s finance committee, the Agreement “seems to have a different orientation in terms of mobilization of funds and the assessment of needs”.  He therefore questioned whether that model “is the perfect fit”.
     Meanwhile, Canada’s delegate emphasized the need for the finance committee to engage directly with other subsidiary bodies to ensure that their resource needs are considered.  Subsidiary bodies are struggling as many of their programmatic areas are persistently unfunded or underfunded, he noted — especially important for the mandates of the Scientific and Technical Body and other subsidiary bodies under the Agreement.  However, he pointed out this has not “been addressed here at all”.
     For his part, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, noted that questions on the Agreement’s financial-governance structure still depend upon undecided arrangements for the functioning of its secretariat.  He further called for consistency between the discussion on financial rules and that pertaining to the terms of reference for the Agreement’s voluntary trust fund.
     Delegates also discussed draft rules relating to funds, with Nigeria’s delegate, speaking for the African Group, expressing concern over the proposed rule by which the procedures for facilitating the participation of representatives of developing State Parties shall ensure their full eligibility and give them priority.  This may offer the wrong impression about eligibility, he said, adding that the current wording is not consistent with article 52 of the Agreement, which governs funding.
     Similarly, the representative of Maldives, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, stressed that it is vital to ensure that all small island developing States are eligible and prioritized under the Agreement’s voluntary trust fund. This is an important aspect of operationalizing the special circumstances of those States in the financial rules, she added.
     On that fund, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, urged adherence “to the wording of the Agreement, which provides for the participation in the meetings of the bodies established under the Agreement, without specifying the nature of those meetings”.  He suggested deleting language specifying that the financial rules do not apply to any additional funds established, as it is “too early to have this type of consideration”.
     Chile’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, called for avoiding the repetition of rules for issues that are not necessarily in the document — for example, referring to the voluntary trust fund for participation, and rules relative to the general fund.  Further citing references to the creation of new funds, he urged the Commission to “focus on our priority today, which is the operationalization of the special fund”.
     In the afternoon, the Preparatory Commission returned to the topic of the rules of procedure that will apply during meetings of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement.  Aiding that discussion, as before, was a compilation of draft rules prepared by the Co-Chairs (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.3 ).
     Jamaica’s representative, speaking for CARICOM, agreed with other delegations that in-person meetings “should be the default position”.  Nevertheless, it is essential that the Conference be able to meet virtually or in a hybrid format under extraordinary circumstances.  The recent COVID-19 pandemic “has demonstrated that events not foreseen” can suddenly create unusual circumstances, she pointed out.
     Morocco’s delegate, speaking for the African Group, echoed that in-person meetings “must remain the norm, particularly for decision-making”.  Virtual or hybrid formats should be reserved for clearly defined circumstances, and he emphasized that any such meeting would require equity safeguards — including balanced time-zone scheduling, technical and financial support to address Africa’s connectivity challenges and secure mechanisms for delegate authentication, forum verification and roll-call voting.
     The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, noted that “online”, “hybrid” and “virtual” seemed to be used in an interchangeable manner in the text, “and we think that different considerations apply to different meetings”.  Rules of procedure should focus on procedural matters in a thematic way, and some aspects of the draft rule governing participation modalities “veer into overly prescriptive procedures”, he said. Meetings shall be in-person and, if they are not, they should be held virtually — “we don’t support the idea of hybrid meetings” of the Conference of the Parties, he added.
     Singapore’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, noted that the Alliance’s suggestion of giving States the option to deliver virtual or pre-recorded statements “has not been taken on board”. He also reiterated that the rule on in-person or virtual participation should be streamlined and kept minimal.  He welcomed views on whether that rule is consistent with the text of the Agreement; if this language must be retained, it should leave scope for flexibility.
     Echoing the need to simplify this rule, Norway’s representative said that her delegation, together with those of Singapore, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Iceland, “have tried to make sense of this [rule]”.  She voiced hope that their joint proposal for streamlining the rule would address the concerns raised.  The rule should simply set out when virtual meetings can be held — including the required threshold, the procedure for deciding whether to hold such a meeting and the scope of decisions that can be taken in a virtual format.
     Meanwhile, Argentina’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group — noting that “the document is already a faithful reflection of what happened in the room” — voiced concern about the Commission’s use of its time.  Turning to the draft, he reiterated that the section providing definitions could include one for ‘exceptional circumstances’.
     The Preparatory Commission will reconvene on Thursday, 28 August, to discuss matters yet to be determined.

16) Briefing Security Council, Senior Official Stresses Importance of Cooperation, Warns against Politicization of Nord Stream Investigations — UN Press (2025-08-26)

   Text:
     Nearly three years since the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, a senior United Nations official underscored that any intentional damage to critical civilian infrastructure should be condemned and investigated.
     The destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 has heightened concerns about the safety and security of critical civilian infrastructure “at a time of heightened tensions in the region”, said Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations.  He noted that the incident has also fuelled speculation over the past years, reiterating that the United Nations has no additional details of events and is not in a position to verify or confirm any claims or reports regarding the matter.
     Recalling that four leaks were reported in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines between 26 and 29 September 2022, he said the pipelines — located in international waters within the Swedish and Danish exclusive economic zones in the Baltic Sea — were not operational at the time but contained several hundred million cubic metres of natural gas.
     According to a 2025 study coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), this incident resulted in the planet’s largest human-caused release of methane.  It concluded that the plausible range of the Nord Stream leak was anywhere from 445,000 to 485,000 tons — “more than twice as much as previously thought”. According to the experts, “the Nord Stream leak contributed as much to global warming as would have 8 million cars driven for a year”, he said, citing the incident as “an important reminder of the environmental impact on global warming caused by the destruction of critical infrastructure”.
     He noted that Danish, German and Swedish authorities have provided regular updates on their separate national investigations.  As part of this investigation, the Federal Public Prosecutor General of Germany announced that a Ukrainian national was arrested in Italy on 21 August, based on a European arrest warrant requested by Germany.  The Russian Federation, however, has continued to voice concerns about the ongoing German investigation, calling for an international inquiry into the Nord Stream incidents.
     In the current volatile security environment, he stressed the importance of avoiding the politicization of any findings or developments, instead urging all parties to prioritize cooperation and dialogue.
     The representative of the Russian Federation called for a meticulous investigation into this “terrorist act”, which resulted in “unprecedented, deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure”, with direct risks to both the environment and navigation in the Baltic Sea.  He stressed that the inquiry must identify the perpetrators to ensure such crimes are never repeated.
     Despite numerous appeals, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, conducting their respective national investigations, had chosen to exclude the international community, releasing only “snippets of information” to the media that were insufficient to form a full picture of the events.  This, he said, was done under the pretext of maintaining investigative confidentiality, while all three States refused to cooperate with the Russian Federation.
     As anticipated, the Danish and Swedish investigations concluded after nearly 18 months with only one finding — that “the Nord Stream pipelines had indeed been blown up” — without identifying those responsible.  German investigators, he continued, were instructed to deliberately prolong the process, citing the detention of a Ukrainian national accused of belonging to the group allegedly behind the explosions.
     According to this account, the operation was carried out by an autonomous group of Ukrainian amateur divers acting “almost independently” or possibly on the orders of Ukraine’s former military leadership.  “We are asked to believe,” he said, “that in the middle of the Baltic Sea — despite a significant military presence, including NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] vessels — a group of semi-professional divers managed to plant explosives on the pipelines unnoticed.”  This sounds more like “the plot of a spy thriller” than a credible explanation, he added.
     “We see no reason to question the impartiality, thoroughness or scope of the ongoing German investigation,” countered Denmark’s delegate.  The explosions on pipelines connecting the Russian Federation and Germany occurred in international waters; however, because one of the explosions took place within the Danish Exclusive Economic Zone, Copenhagen’s independent authorities conducted their own investigation in close cooperation with international partners. Their findings confirmed that the pipelines had been deliberately sabotaged, but concluded there were insufficient grounds to pursue a criminal case in Denmark.  “No one is obstructing the Russian investigation,” he emphasized.
     He further noted that, while Moscow has repeatedly demanded the Council’s attention on the Nord Stream incidents, it has simultaneously been carrying out systematic military attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure — rendering its professed concern for infrastructure “rather hollow”.
     France’s representative was among many speakers criticizing the Russian Federation for its repetitive convening of unnecessary meetings such as today’s, noting that they only illustrate Moscow’s willingness to divert the Council’s attention and resources.  Investigations by Swedish and Danish authorities into the 2022 explosions cannot be said to lack transparency, and they have kept the Council informed of the findings of their in-depth, complex inquiries through various letters.  Noting that those national investigations were closed last February, while that of Germany’s continues, she said that, “by making the Council meet many times, the Russian Federation is putting pressure on Germany’s investigation, which is unacceptable”.
     Similarly, the United Kingdom’s delegate called on the Council to respect the integrity of national investigations, pointing out that “attempts to politicize the process or draw premature conclusions risk undermining the credibility of the legal proceedings and the cooperation between the countries involved”.
     Greece’s delegate concurred, pointing out that the Council is not the right forum for discussions of the internal legal and judicial processes of a sovereign State, adding:  “These are ongoing, confidential criminal investigations and the independence of the judiciary in Germany, as in any other country, cannot and should not be undermined or subjected to political pressure.”
     In a contrasting address, China’s representative, recalling his delegation’s requests for an objective, impartial investigation to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, observed that only limited information from Sweden, Denmark and Germany’s investigations being made public, leaving the public to rely on media exposés to speculate over what happened, stressing:  “This is anything but normal.”  Calling on Germany to expedite its investigations, he stressed:  “Truth should not be swept under the rug, investigations should not be politicized, and similar incidents should not be allowed to recur and perpetrators not allowed to walk free.”
     Algeria’s delegate, taking note of the latest findings provided by Sweden, Denmark and Germany, voiced grave concern over the deliberate attack on the pipelines.  Noting that his country is linked to Europe through three gas pipelines, he said that such attacks on critical infrastructure are “unacceptable under any circumstances”.  He called for the facts around the events to be fully determined, underscoring the need for accountability, a point echoed by the delegates of Somalia and Sierra Leone, with the latter emphasizing:  “The rule of law must prevail at every stage, from investigation to prosecution, so that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done in the circumstances.”
     For her part, Guyana’s representative, also underscoring the need for accountability for the intentional destruction of critical infrastructure, took note of the announcement of an arrest of a Ukrainian national in connection with the attacks by the Office of the Federal Prosecutor of Germany, said:  “We are hopeful that this development will accelerate the path towards accountability.”
     Similarly, Pakistan’s representative called for the strengthening of international cooperative frameworks to deter and prevent attacks on transnational infrastructure, voicing hope that the investigations, once concluded, will “reinforce the norm that all such attacks will be met with proper scrutiny and accountability in a transparent and objective manner”.
     For her part, Slovenia’s delegate reaffirmed her condemnation of the sabotage directed towards critical undersea infrastructure, voicing concern about the severe environmental impact of the incident, believed to have caused the single largest discharge of methane ever recorded.  Underscoring the need to protect critical submarine infrastructure against deliberate and accidental damage, she cited numerous such incidents in the Baltic Sea in recent years.  In that context, she voiced her country’s support for Germany’s ongoing investigations.
     Similarly, the Republic of Korea’s delegate joined other speakers in underscoring the need for transparency, due process, non-politicization and cooperative engagement with investigative authorities.  “Three and a half years of war in Ukraine have clearly shown how essential the protection of critical infrastructure is to international peace and stability,” he stated.
     The representative of Panama, Council President for the month, spoke in his national capacity to condemn any attack or act of sabotage against critical infrastructure — particularly when such actions threaten civilian populations or the environment.  He emphasized the vital role of the “invisible arteries” that link millions of people across continents, enabling the uninterrupted flow of energy services.  He further noted that safeguarding transnational infrastructure extends beyond energy facilities to include communication networks.  Citing Panama as an example, he highlighted that eight submarine cables converge through its territory, emphasizing that “protecting this infrastructure must be a collective priority.”
     The representative of the United States recognized the seriousness of the incident, rejecting politicization and using the Nord Stream sabotage as a basis for levelling hyperbolic accusations and escalatory rhetoric. “Let’s not focus the Council’s time and attention on an incident that took place nearly three years ago, but rather on ending the war in Ukraine,” he stressed, expressing full confidence in Germany’s independent judicial process.  He added: “President Trump has focused on one goal:  Bringing about a negotiated and durable peace in Ukraine to end the human suffering. We call on Russia to focus on that goal, as well.”

     As the commission tasked with preparing for the entry into force of a high-seas biodiversity treaty continued its second session today, delegates from small island developing States issued a strong call that their countries be equitably represented, including through a dedicated seat in the treaty’s Scientific and Technical Body.
     The gathering — the second of three sessions of the body formally known as the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement” — is taking place at UN Headquarters from 18 to 29 August.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     Article 49 of the Agreement establishes a Scientific and Technical Body to aid implementation.  Today, delegates considered a draft model of the terms of reference and modalities for that Body’s operation — prepared by the Commission’s Co-Chairs — as part of a larger consideration of the terms of reference, modalities and rules of procedure for the treaty’s subsidiary bodies.
     This morning, “I turned to the dictionary”, said Palau’s delegate, who spoke for the Alliance of Small Island States, to confirm the difference between “equity” and “equality”.  The Alliance’s understanding of equitable geographic representation on the Scientific and Technical Body includes a dedicated seat for small island developing States.  As that Body will make critical decisions regarding ocean governance that will impact small island developing States, it is “really unacceptable” for those States not to have direct representation on it, she stressed.
     “The UN regional grouping system has not always adequately served to ensure [small island developing States’] representation in crucial matters,” she added.  The explicit references to the special circumstances of those States — particularly in the Agreement’s provisions enumerating the principles that should guide Parties thereto — “create not merely aspirational language, but a legal foundation”, she said.  This legal obligation reflects a practical necessity for expertise and “cannot be adequately represented by proxy”, she stressed, adding that a “grand vacation” in Palau or Antigua and Barbuda does not make one an expert on small island developing States.
     Trinidad and Tobago’s representative, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), added that the section on the capacity of members “should include a reference to the use of relevant traditional knowledge of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, along with best available science and scientific information”.  He expressed a preference for a 27-member body, with 5 members from each of the UN regional groups, 1 specially reserved seat for a representative from small island developing States and 1 specially reserved seat for a representative from Indigenous Peoples and local communities with traditional-knowledge expertise.
     The representative of the Seychelles, speaking for the African Group, stressed that members should serve in their personal capacity and act impartially.  She, too, highlighted the need for regional balance and equitable regional representation.  The experts must be selected on the basis of “demonstrated competence and relevant qualifications”, she said, and the selection process should include dedicated seats to ensure representation of least developed countries.  She also expressed her group’s preference for a detailed, non-exhaustive list of eligibility criteria, with a view to adding additional competencies as necessary to adapt to the evolving needs of the Agreement.
     The representative of the Federated States of Micronesia, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, echoed the need for flexibility, adding:  “The one thing that we want to avoid is a definitive list that hurts us later.”  On additional members, he voiced support for having one from small island developing States and one from least developed countries — “and limiting it to that”, because “when a lot of big countries have an interest, then we tend to lose out”.  Similarly, he expressed support for nominating members from Indigenous Peoples and local communities.
     Delegates also discussed the scope and functions of the Body as identified in the Co-Chairs’ draft model, diverging over how much of the Agreement should be reproduced in the Body’s terms of reference.  Palau’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said that the section on functions should retain its explicit reference to article 7(m) of the Agreement, which recognizes the special circumstances of small island developing States and least developed countries.  This is especially crucial in the absence of a guaranteed seat for small island developing States on the Body.  Further, she said, the sentence regarding the Scientific and Technical Body using the best available science should also include a reference to relevant traditional knowledge.
     The representative of Colombia, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, emphasized that the Scientific and Technical Body’s unique and cross-cutting function requires full reference to articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Agreement.  While some delegations cited specific provisions in article 7, she stressed that the Body’s work must be grounded in all of the general principles outlined in the Agreement.
     The representative of Iceland, noting that article 7 lists the principles and approaches that guide the entire implementation of the Agreement, expressed support for including this article in its entirety — without any “partitioning” —in the Body’s terms of reference.  However, he noted, other delegations have requested the inclusion of other articles and “we are worried that we are going down the rabbit hole of reproducing the text of the Agreement in the terms of reference”. This is not useful or necessary, he pointed out, especially since there is a section in the draft terms of reference specifically outlining their relationship with the Agreement.
     Delegates also considered the rules of procedure that will govern meetings of the Agreement’s subsidiary bodies.  The representative of the Seychelles, speaking for the African Group, said that the rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties should apply mutatis mutandis to the Scientific and Technical Body — “with the caveat that, in case of divergences, the [Conference’s] rules of procedure shall prevail”.
     The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, agreed that the rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties will apply mutatis mutandis .  Nevertheless, the representative of Trinidad and Tobago, speaking for CARICOM, said that the Scientific and Technical Body would need its own explicit rules of procedure, even as they incorporate relevant Conference rules and make any necessary adjustments.
     For her part, the Russian Federation’s representative emphasized that — given the Scientific and Technical Body’s important function — “there is an absolute need” to specify that every State Party to the Agreement is a member of this Body.  She also underlined the need to stipulate that all its work be “done by consensus”.  Iran’s delegate also said that the technical nature of the Scientific and Technical Body requires that its work be done “by consensus”.
     In the afternoon, the Preparatory Commission considered the operationalization of the Agreement’s provisions relating to financing — specifically, those governing the voluntary trust fund to facilitate wide participation in the meetings of bodies established under the Agreement and the “special fund” that will be used to finance various treaty activities.  In doing so, delegates offered feedback on a document created by the Co-Chairs containing possible elements of a process to operationalize the special fund.
     Nigeria’s representative, speaking for the African Group, said that effective implementation of the Agreement depends largely on adequate and sustainable funding; therefore, early operationalization of the special fund is crucial.  He highlighted the element in the Co-Chairs’ document concerning full recognition of the special circumstances of small island developing States and least developed countries, expressing support for the inclusion of language that also recognizes the needs of developing State Parties.  This would include geographically disadvantaged States, such as small island developing States, coastal African States, archipelagic States and middle-income developing countries.
     Similarly, Palau’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, highlighted the need to include language ensuring equitable geographical representation and participation for developing State Parties, as well as representatives of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  Another “missing principle”, he said, is observer engagement in the operationalization process, especially for those entities that are from developing countries.  Welcoming the intersessional work suggested in the document — including the proposed technical working group — he added that “we would need to ensure that there is substantial and dedicated representation of smaller developing States’ technical experts” in that group.
     The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, voiced support for full recognition of the special circumstances of small island developing States, landlocked developing countries and least developed countries.  “At the same time, we recognize the centrality of the special fund for the implementation of the Agreement in all its dimensions,” he stated. Focusing at this stage on just one of the principles underlying the Agreement is likely to prejudge the fund’s role as the driving force behind the full and effective implementation of all these dimensions.  While recognizing the need to progress quickly, he acknowledged the need for a process enabling interactions “among us and existing funds to explore practical and cost-effective options for hosting or administering the special fund”.
     The representative of Antigua and Barbuda, speaking for CARICOM, called for simplified processes for application, approval and disbursement among the guiding principles included in the document. She also emphasized that the members of CARICOM, along with other developing countries, “regard the special fund as the main arm of the [Agreement’s] financial mechanism”.  Therefore, while pointing to the need for coherence with the Global Environment Facility trust fund — the other part of the Agreement’s financial mechanism that will fund various treaty activities — she stressed: “But, we consider this special fund to be the primary source for implementation — it should be treated accordingly.”
     The Preparatory Commission will reconvene on Wednesday, 27 August, to consider a refreshed text, prepared by the Co-Chairs, containing draft rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement.

     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
     ** Artificial Intelligence
     Alright, good afternoon.  I’ll start off with a statement reacting to what Sharon [Birch] just said, and this is on the decision by the General Assembly on a new artificial intelligence governance institution within the UN.
     The Secretary-General warmly welcomes the General Assembly's decision to establish two new mechanisms within the United Nations to promote international cooperation on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI).
     The establishment of the United Nations Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and the Global Dialogue on AI Governance marks a significant step forward in global efforts to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while addressing its risks.  This path-breaking milestone underlines Member States’ commitment to build on the Global Digital Compact, adopted as part of the Pact for the Future in September 2024.
     The Global Dialogue on AI Governance will provide an inclusive platform within the United Nations for states and stakeholders to discuss the critical issues concerning artificial intelligence facing humanity today.
     The Scientific Panel on AI will serve as a crucial bridge between cutting-edge AI research and policy-making.  By providing rigorous, independent scientific assessments, it will help the international community to anticipate emerging challenges and make informed decisions about how we govern this transformative technology.
     The Secretary-General will shortly be launching an open call for nominations for the Scientific Panel, which will present its annual reports at the Global Dialogue on AI Governance to take place in July 2026 in Geneva and in 2027 in New York.  You can already mark your calendars.
     The Secretary-General calls on all stakeholders to support this historic initiative and contribute to building a future where artificial intelligence serves the common good of all humanity.
     ** Sudan
     This morning, the Secretary-General was on the phone, and he spoke with Kamil El-Tayeb Idris, the Transitional Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan, to discuss the humanitarian situation in Sudan, as well as the protection of civilians and humanitarian access.  I think we’ve been updating you regularly on the tragic humanitarian situation in Sudan, notably in El-Fasher, which both the Secretary-General and Mr. Idris discussed.  They focused on the dire humanitarian situation in El-Fasher, caused by the continued encirclement and bombardments.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     Turning to the situation in the Gaza Strip, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) cites a report today from the Ministry of Health that another three people have died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of such reported deaths to 303, including 117 children.
     At the same time, the Israeli military has issued a new displacement order covering approximately one square kilometre in Gaza City’s Ad Daraj and Ash Sheikh Radwan neighbourhoods.
     People continue to flee in fear for their lives, seeking safety wherever possible.  Between 14 August, when the offensive on Gaza City was announced — and yesterday, partners tracking population movements recorded more than 36,200 displacements, including over 11,600 from the north to the south of the Gaza Strip.
     The majority of displaced people came from neighbourhoods in Gaza City, with more than two thirds moving to Deir al Balah and nearly a third heading to Khan Younis.  And as you know, the majority of people in Gaza have been displaced more than once.
     Turning to the health situation, yesterday, hospitals in Gaza warned of severe shortages of blood units, with daily needs exceeding 350 units.  With many patients critically injured by hostilities, more blood is needed to save lives, yet community donations have plummeted due to famine and malnutrition. The Ministry of Health in Gaza has issued an urgent appeal to replenish blood stocks in hospitals.
     Meanwhile, obstructions imposed by the Israeli authorities on the flow of aid into and within the Gaza Strip continue to constrain delivery of life-saving assistance by the UN and its partners.  Yesterday, 6 out of 12 planned missions that required coordination with the Israeli authorities were facilitated; most of them were to move supplies into and within southern Gaza and collect fuel from the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing.
     Another three missions to collect cargo from that crossing as well as Zikim were impeded and therefore only partially accomplished, while two other missions had to be cancelled by the organizers.  One mission to carry out road repairs in Khan Younis was denied outright by the Israeli authorities.
     Our humanitarian colleagues stress that with famine now confirmed in Gaza governorate, the humanitarian consequences of ongoing hostilities, displacement, and aid obstruction are even more devastating.  We urgently call for an immediate ceasefire and full, unhindered humanitarian access across the Gaza Strip to bring an end to the suffering of civilians and an immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.
     ** Ukraine
     On Ukraine, our humanitarian colleagues have updated us on the situation there as well and they tell us that more civilians have been killed and injured following hostilities and attacks across the country these past days. Damage has also been reported to schools and energy infrastructure.
     The Donetsk region was the most impacted, and the regions of Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia were also affected.
     Aid organizations are mobilized and have distributed repair materials, hot meals and drinks, and are providing psychological support.
     Meanwhile, humanitarians continue to support people fleeing hostilities in the regions of Donetsk and Dnipro.  Between 22 and 25 August, more than 2,000 people, including many children, were evacuated from the Donetsk region.  With growing pressure on the transit site in the town of Pavlohrad, authorities and aid organizations opened new facilities in the village of Voloske, Dnipro region, and the town of Lozova, Kharkiv region.
     Evacuees receive medical and psychosocial support, hot meals, water and hygiene supplies, and can register for cash assistance before moving on to safer areas.  Humanitarians are also supporting arrivals in other parts of the country.
     ** Security Council
     And this afternoon, at 4 p.m., the Security Council will convene for a briefing on Threats to International Peace and Security.  Miroslav Jenča, the Assistant Secretary-General in the Political and Peacebuilding Department, will brief Council members.
     ** Deputy Secretary-General’s Travel
     Yesterday, our Deputy Secretary-General was in Nigeria where she addressed the inaugural African Chiefs of Defence Staff Summit that took place in Abuja.  She called for a new era of strategic regional defence collaboration.  She stressed that sustainable development and peace and security are mutually reinforcing, underscoring that development remains the most effective deterrent to insecurity.  She urged coordinated action to confront terrorism, climate change, cyber threats, and disinformation.
     ** Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
     Also I just want to flag two other items, one from the World Health Organization and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) which revealed today in a joint report that one out of four people living on this planet — that’s 2.1 billion human beings globally — still lack access to safely managed drinking water, putting them at risk of disease and deeper social exclusion.
     Billions of others also still lack safely managed sanitation and basic hygiene services at home.
     People living in the least developed countries are the most affected communities.  These inequalities, however, are especially stark for girls, who often bear the brunt of water collection and face additional barriers during menstruation.
     The report calls for accelerated action if we are to keep our promise to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
     ** Thailand
     And also, I can tell you that we join our colleagues at the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to commend the adoption by the Thai Government of a resolution that will grant long-staying refugees from Myanmar the right to work in Thailand.
     This resolution recognizes the protracted situation of some 81,000 forcibly displaced people hosted in temporary shelters along the Thai-Myanmar border.  The new policy will enable refugees to work legally in the country and to contribute meaningfully to the Thai economy.
     Many of these refugees have been living in camps for decades and are entirely dependent on humanitarian aid.  Around 47 per cent of them were born in temporary shelters.
     UNHCR said that building on Thailand’s 50-year legacy and leadership in hosting refugees, this new policy, if fully implemented, will set a new regional benchmark for a sustainable, rights-based refugee solution that could serve as a model for other countries facing similar challenges.
     That’s it.  Abdelhamid and then Amelie.
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Are you aware that Israel today… […] They invaded Ramallah, and they went to the heart of Ramallah, and at least 15 Palestinians were wounded.  Do you have any…?
     Spokesman :  Yeah.  I mean, we're just seeing these reports.  I can tell you that we're concerned about these operations and the way they were conducted in the West Bank.
     Question :  My second question about the response of Israel to the peace proposal. The spokesman for Qatari foreign ministry, Majdi Al Ansari, said that we're still waiting for the response of Israel, although Hamas accepted the proposal 10 days ago.  What is your take on that?
     Spokesman :  Well, as you know, we are not directly involved in the negotiations. The Secretary-General has been kept regularly informed of what is going on.  But obviously, it needs…  as we've said repeatedly, we need to see the leaders of Israel, the leaders of Hamas to find the political courage to agree on a plan for a ceasefire that will lead to everything we've been talking about, and we hope that will happen.  Amelie?
     Question :  Thanks, Steph.  On the AI panel, so the SG will launch the appeal for candidates to apply.  Do you have any kind of timeline of when he will recommend the names until?  [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  I don't have an exact timeline.  I know he's keen on moving quickly on this.  The letters will go out, and I'm sure there'll be details to the timeframe.  But as I said, the next meeting, I think, will take place within a year, so things will move quickly.  And I think Secretary-General has in the past moved as swiftly as possible within this organization on AI matters.  Edie Lederer?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  There was a major protest today in Israel led by hostage families demanding a ceasefire. Is this the kind of action that the Secretary-General would support in hopes of getting a ceasefire more quickly?
     Spokesman :  Far from the Secretary-General to involve himself in domestic Israeli policies.  I refer you to what I just said to Abdelhamid, which he hopes that there is a solution, that there is a ceasefire, that we see humanitarian aid flow, that we see hostage families reunited with their loved ones, that we see the return of a political path, that we see the people of Gaza being afforded the ability to hope again, right?  And I can tell you that, on the hostage issues, the Secretary-General has very often met with hostage families, and he's been following this very closely.  Dezhi?
     Question :  Yesterday, the Secretary-General urged for an independent investigation on the Nasser Hospital strike.  Today, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) released their initial findings on that strike.  They claimed that they neutralized six Hamas terrorists and one camera.  Does the Secretary-General think this is a good start with the finding?
     Spokesman :  Look.  I think there will be a good start when there's accountability for those who have lost their lives, your colleagues, the medical workers and all other civilians.
     Question :  Why there's always Hamas?  Last time when the journalist from Al Jazeera got killed, the Israeli accused Hamas, and this time there's Hamas.  So is this like a scapegoat in this conflict?
     Spokesman :  This is a question for a seasoned Middle East analyst.  It's not for me to answer these questions and to comment on these things.  I think our position has been very clear.
     Question :  Okay.  Let me let me ask you for one last comment.  Does the Secretary-General have any comment of the intention of President [Donald] Trump to change Department of Defence to Department of War?
     Spokesman :  No.  We try to stay away from domestic politics inasmuch as we can in most countries.  We don't always succeed, but we try.  All right.  Yes, Sinan.
     Question :  Thank you, Stéphane.  In recent days, the Supreme Court of Iran confirmed the death sentence of Kurdish activist Sharifa Mohammadi.  So the Kurdistan National Congress Women’s Commission basically published an article, and they are saying they respectfully call on the United Nations and UN-Women to urge Islamic Republic of Iran to impose an immediate moratorium on all executions and to release human rights defenders, Sharifa Mohammadi, and all other political prisoners.  So the question is, does Secretary-General going to, like, make an urgent call or has any message for Iranian regime?
     Spokesman :  I think we have been very public, both from this podium and in reports by our human rights colleagues, on our deep concern of the continued use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as we have in other countries that continue to use this as a punishment.  We call on all countries to enact an immediate moratorium on the death penalty.  Okay.  No questions online? See, when I come early, fewer questions.

20) General Assembly Takes Action on Drafts on Security Council Equitable Representation, Increased Membership, Artificial Intelligence, Other Matters — UN Press (2025-08-26)

   Text:
     The General Assembly today adopted several resolutions including one establishing a scientific panel on artificial intelligence (AI) and a global dialogue on its governance to promote sustainable development and bridge digital divides.  The Assembly, also by a recorded vote with the United States as the only Member State voting against, adopted a text on cooperation between the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
     By the terms of the first text titled “Terms of reference and modalities for the establishment and functioning of the Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence and the Global Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence Governance” (document A/79/l.118 ), the Assembly pledged to establish a panel comprising 40 experts to assess its risks, opportunities and impact.  By other terms, the 193-member body pledged to establish a global dialogue to provide policy discussions and consensus-building with the aim of strengthening global AI governance, supporting the Sustainable Development Goals and closing digital divides.
     Several speakers took to the floor in explanation of vote, including Iraq’s delegate on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, who emphasized that AI, if “deployed responsibly, inclusively, and to serve the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals”, has the potential to transform public services, education, health, and digital economies, while accelerating the 2030 Agenda.  However, such benefits depend on a fair and inclusive international governance framework that ensures equitable access, prevents widening divides, and takes into account AI’s social, economic, ethical, cultural and technical implications.
     “Full inclusion of developing countries in shaping the future of AI governance” is key, he said, stressing principles of sovereignty, equity and transparency.  While the Group demonstrated “considerable flexibility” throughout the negotiations, this should not be mistaken as compromising core priorities, notably the need for robust capacity-building and meaningful participation in AI processes. He urged all delegations to support the outcome as a “balanced and forward-looking foundation for international cooperation on AI governance” and pledged to remain actively engaged to ensure AI governance is inclusive, development-oriented, and aligned with the aspirations of the Global South.
     Denmark’s representative, speaking for the European Union, pleased by the consensus on “L.118”, stressed that this outcome “sends a strong signal to the world” that the UN remains relevant in addressing the fast-evolving technology landscape and its impact on societies and human rights. The bloc has consistently prioritized the panel’s scientific independence and the multi-stakeholder nature of the global dialogue to foster inclusive exchanges that strengthen AI governance.  These mechanisms, he affirmed, will “contribute to building the UN’s membership’s capacity on AI by fostering shared knowledge, common understanding and pooled experiences”, particularly benefiting developing countries, and will soon become “valuable tools to continue advancing discussions on AI at the UN”.
     On another matter, by a recorded vote of 114 favour to 1 against (United States), with 19 abstentions, the Assembly adopted the text titled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent States” (document A/79/L.114 ), noting the activities of the Commonwealth in fostering regional cooperation across diverse fields, including trade, economic development, education, healthcare, culture, science, environmental protection and illicit trafficking.  It further highlighted the important of strengthening cooperation between the UN and the CIS through inter-agency forums.
     Introducing “L.114”, Tajikistan’s delegate that the resolution — a technical update of the biannual text — builds on previous General Assembly resolutions and reaffirms the importance of international cooperation in addressing economic, social, cultural and humanitarian challenges in line with the UN Charter.  He emphasized that this cooperation must be grounded in the principles of sovereignty, equality and international law.
     The United States’ representative, who called for a recorded vote on “L.114”, expressed serious reservations about the text, particularly the emphasis on coordination with the CIS, which it views as duplicative of UN efforts.  Washington, D.C., stressed that such redundancy diverts attention from the UN’s core mission of maintaining international peace and security.  The resolution, she said, is another “pro forma exercise” that adds little value, similar to many Assembly items.
     Also today, the Assembly concluded its discussion of the “Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Security Council”, with speakers welcoming the General Assembly’s approval of an oral decision ensuring consideration of the topic in the next session.
     The representative of Italy, speaking on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus Group, welcomed the “productive and focused discussions on the five clusters” and noted that the updated elements paper “provides a useful reflection of the discussions held during this session”.  Stressing that the Group has engaged with a “proactive, flexible and constructive mindset”, he emphasized that Security Council reform must remain a “Member State–driven process” within the intergovernmental negotiations, with the common goal of achieving a Council that is “more accountable, representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective and democratic”.  Concluding, the Group affirmed its support for the oral draft decision to ensure “a smooth transition of this crucial negotiation into the eightieth session”.
     Bahrain’s delegate, speaking for the Arab Group, noted that the Pact for the Future reaffirmed the Member States’ commitment to reforming the Security Council and injected renewed momentum into the negotiation process, while welcoming the consensus adoption of the oral decision, which “ensures a smooth transition to the next session”.  Stressing that the intergovernmental negotiations process is the sole platform for reaching an agreement on the Council expansion and reform, she underlined the need for solutions with “the broadest possible political acceptance among Member States”.  “We ask for a full-fledged permanent Arab representation in the category of permanent seats” as well as “equitable representation in the category of non-permanent seats” in any expansion, she said, reaffirming the Arab Group’s “commitment to actively and constructively participate… with the aim of achieving genuine and comprehensive reform in the spirit of transparency and constructive engagement”.
     Japan’s delegate, also speaking for Brazil, Germany and India, stressed that “reform of the Council is urgently needed and must be advanced without delay”, as underscored in the Pact for the Future.  While welcoming discussions on reform models, the Group of 4 voiced “serious concerns” that the revised elements paper omitted “the majority support for expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories” and wrongly portrayed the intergovernmental negotiations process as the exclusive platform for reform.  Warning that the current session “has not yielded any substantial outcomes”, he said forthcoming sessions must deliver “tangible progress that leads to text-based negotiations with clearly specified timelines”.  He also emphasized that failure to act undermines trust in the UN itself, insisting that reform is vital “not only to strengthen the UN as a whole, but also to maintain the entire international order”.
     The Secretariat also read out a statement in relation to draft decision A/79/L.103 , welcoming Switzerland’s offer to host the sixteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva in October 2025.  The statement further noted that Switzerland will cover all additional costs related to hosting the session, in consultation with the UN Secretary-General.

23) Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General — UN Press (2025-08-25)

   Text:
     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
     All right, good afternoon.
     ** Secretary-General/Gaza
     I will start off with a statement on Gaza.  The Secretary-General strongly condemns the killing of Palestinians today in Israeli strikes that hit Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. Those killed, in addition to civilians, included medical personnel and journalists.
     We want to extend our condolences to families and colleagues of those journalists killed, especially those representatives of the Associated Press, Reuters and Al Jazeera, who are in this room or online.
     These latest horrific killings highlight the extreme risks that medical personnel and journalists face as they carry out their vital work amid this brutal conflict.
     The Secretary-General recalls that civilians, including medical personnel and journalists, must be respected and protected at all times.  He calls for a prompt and impartial investigation into these killings.
     He reiterates that medical personnel and journalists must be able to perform their essential duties without interference, without intimidation, and without harm, and in full accordance with international humanitarian law.
     The Secretary-General reiterates his call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, unfettered humanitarian access across Gaza and for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages being held in Gaza.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     We just all saw the horrific attack this morning on Nasser Hospital.  Turning to the overall situation in the Gaza Strip, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warns that ongoing air strikes and hostilities, including attacks on healthcare, are causing further casualties and damaging or destroying critical civilian infrastructure.
     With famine conditions now confirmed in Gaza governorate, hunger and malnutrition among children are deepening.  Our partners working on nutrition remind us that in any food crisis, children with underlying health conditions are affected first and without proper nutrition, water and care, their condition worsens more quickly.
     Less aid means more malnutrition; we and our partners continue to call for the unrestricted flow of humanitarian aid into and throughout Gaza.
     Today, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 11 people have died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours.  This brings the total number of people who have died due to malnutrition and hunger to 300.  That, again, is according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.
     Across the Strip, people continue to be displaced while seeking safety and shelter.  Our partners tracking population movements in Gaza report that since 20 August, some 5,000 people are estimated to have been displaced from northern Gaza to Deir al Balah and Khan Younis.  Some 8,000 others have been displaced to the west of Gaza City.  This brings the total number of new displacements since the end of the ceasefire in mid-March to more than 800,000.
     Meanwhile, OCHA warns that aid convoys in Gaza continue to face delays, they continue to face movement obstructions and many other obstacles. Yesterday, out of 15 humanitarian missions that required coordination, the Israeli authorities facilitated seven, which included the collection of fuel from Kerem Shalom crossing and its distribution to areas where it is needed most.  Four missions had to be either cancelled by the organizers or were denied outright by Israeli authorities.  The remaining ones were initially approved but then impeded on the ground and only partially accomplished.
     Our partners said that several education facilities across the Gaza Strip, all used as shelters for displaced people, were attacked last week.
     With local authorities announcing that final exams for over 35,000 high school students are due to be held in two weeks, we and our partners reiterate our call for the protection of education facilities in accordance with international humanitarian law.
     Meanwhile, Israeli forces released a World Health Organization (WHO) colleague who had been detained now for more than a month.  Our colleagues at the WHO in Geneva obviously welcomed the release and called, once again, for the protection of health staff and all humanitarians workers.
     OCHA continues to call for the protection of civilians, including humanitarians, health workers and journalists.  None should ever be a target.
     ** Lebanon/Israel
     Moving to the situation in southern Lebanon:  Our peacekeepers there report continued Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) military activities, including air violations and patrolling, in southern Lebanon.
     Over the weekend, the peacekeepers found weapons’ caches, including mortar shells with fuses attached, rocket launchers and explosives. They also found tunnels at two locations in Sector West.  All of them were referred to the Lebanese Armed Forces as per existing protocol.
     Just to note that also on Sunday, a UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) patrol faced obstruction by a group of individuals in Sector West.  The group briefly stopped the patrol, and the Lebanese Army was informed of the situation. We reiterate the critical importance of the mission’s unhindered freedom of movement.  Any act hampering the crucial work of the peacekeepers must stop, and it is not acceptable.
     ** Israel/Houthis
     I was asked over the weekend about our reaction to the latest round of escalation between Israel and the Houthis.  I can tell you that we note with concern the continued Houthi drone and missile attacks on Israel, as well as the launching of strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen by the Israeli Defense Forces that took place yesterday.  Those attacks reportedly targeted the presidential palace complex, as well as energy infrastructure in Sana’a.
     The Secretary-General calls for a cessation of all military activities.  Any additional escalation could worsen regional tensions that may further destabilize Yemen and the region and pose grave risks to the already dire humanitarian situation in the country.
     The Secretary-General also emphasizes that international law, including international humanitarian law as applicable, must be respected by all parties at all times.
     ** Sudan
     Turning to Sudan, we welcome the recent breakthrough in humanitarian access in South Kordofan State.
     Yesterday, a UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) convoy successfully delivered humanitarian supplies to Dilling town in South Kordofan State, marking the first substantial delivery to this area by any UN agency since October 2024.  The convoy will now continue to Kadugli, the state capital.  The supplies will benefit more than 120,000 vulnerable people in Dilling and Kadugli, where humanitarian needs have reached catastrophic levels and communities have been under siege for months.
     Meanwhile, OCHA also warns that violence continues to escalate in North Darfur State.  Between 19 and 20 August, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that insecurity forced 1,000 people to flee the famine-stricken Abu Shouk displacement camp, on the outskirts of the state capital El Fasher. Abu Shouk has witnessed several deadly attacks in recent weeks, with reports of abductions of women and young children from the site over recent days.  OCHA is also alarmed by reports of a new wave of violence in El Fasher itself, including alleged artillery shelling of the town's main functioning hospital.  And again, medical infrastructure and medical personnel must always be protected and must never be a target.
     We are also gravely concerned by the worsening nutrition crisis in Melit, in North Darfur.  A recent survey by our partner Relief International found that one in three children is acutely malnourished.  This places thousands of children under 5 at imminent risk of severe illness, developmental complications, and death.  You may recall this is the same area where an aid convoy from the World Food Programme (WFP) was attacked last week while trying to offload humanitarian supplies.
     We and our partners remain committed to providing the much-needed support to people as access allows.  But insecurity, logistical challenges and severe underfunding continue to hamper our efforts.  We once again call on the parties to respect international humanitarian law, ensure safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers, and prioritize the protection of civilians.
     ** Syria
     An update from Syria, where our colleagues at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) tell us that we and our partners continue to deliver critical aid to Sweida.
     Today, 11 trucks from the World Food Programme (WFP) reached Sweida carrying over 9,000 ready-to-eat food rations.  Since the escalation of hostilities in that area in July, WFP has provided emergency food assistance to over 300,000 people across Sweida, Dara’a, and Rural Damascus governorates.
     Commercial traffic into As-Sweida remains limited but six commercial trucks managed to enter yesterday.
     OCHA says that restoring unimpeded commercial access, alongside stabilizing the security environment, is essential to ensure that assistance reaches populations effectively and to prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.
     Also yesterday, our Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, visited Dara’a Governorate to assess the humanitarian situation there following the outbreak of violence in that area back in July. He met with families who had endured difficult years in their homes but were only recently forced to flee.
     The need for food, water, sanitation, hygiene and non-food items remains acute.  The education sector is particularly overstretched:  many schools have been destroyed, only a few remain functional, and some are just being used as a place to hosting displaced families.
     With the school year fast approaching in mid-September, urgent alternatives must be found to protect both children’s right to education and families’ need for shelter.
     Mr. Adbelmoula also visited Harak National Hospital in rural Dara'a, rehabilitated by the local community.  Today, it serves both residents and displaced families.  He underlined the importance of scaling up support to reinforce such community-driven efforts.
     ** Pakistan
     Turning to Pakistan, our humanitarian colleagues say that over the last ten days local authorities have said that 400 people have been killed and over 190 injured due to heavy rains and flash floods in various areas of the country.  Over 20,000 people remain displaced due to the flooding.
     Pakistan’s Meteorological Department says a new monsoon system is in the forecast, with heavy rainfall expected to continue in the coming days.
     OCHA reports that people affected by the flooding need shelter supplies, medical assistance, cash for work, hygiene kits, clean drinking water and education, as well as protection support, particularly for women and girls.
     The authorities are leading the response, with support from the United Nations and local partners. Over the weekend, Tom Fletcher, our Emergency Relief Coordinator, released $600,000 from the regional pooled fund to support the ongoing efforts.
     Since the start of the 2025 monsoon season on 26 June, Pakistan has faced extensive destruction from heavy rains and floods, with 798 reported fatalities and more than 1,000 injuries.  That is what local authorities are telling us.
     ** Myanmar
     I just want to read into the record the statement we issued over the weekend in which the Secretary-General said that eight years since their forced mass displacement from Rakhine State, Rohingya people in and outside of Myanmar are facing a further deterioration of their already dire circumstances.
     In Rakhine State, Rohingya and other civilians are caught in the crossfire between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army and subjected to forced recruitment, human rights violations and many other abuse.  Continued violence has forced more Rohingya to flee, including into Bangladesh, which is already generously hosting 1.1 million refugees from Myanmar.
     Reports of pushbacks, removals and deportations across the region raise serious concerns over potential violations of the principle of non-refoulement and shrinking asylum space.  Funding cuts are severely curtailing education, food assistance, healthcare, livelihood opportunities and protection services for those refugees.
     The Secretary-General reiterates his call for the protection of all civilians in accordance with applicable obligations under international law.
     He recalls that during his visit to Cox’s Bazar earlier this year, where he witnessed the resilience of the Rohingya communities and stressed the urgent need for strengthened international solidarity and increased support, in parallel to efforts towards a comprehensive political solution that meaningfully includes the Rohingya and addresses their displacement and the root causes of the protracted crisis.
     The Secretary-General is hopeful that the 30 September High–level Conference on Rohingya and other minorities that will take place in New York, as mandated by the United Nations General Assembly, will draw renewed international attention to the urgency of finding durable solutions.
     Julie Bishop, his Special Envoy for Myanmar, continues to engage all stakeholders towards the cessation of violence and a viable Myanmar-led political process to build conditions conducive to the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of the Rohingya people to their homes in Myanmar.
     ** Questions and Answers
     Spokesman :  Edie and then Gabriel.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  And please thank the Secretary-General for his strong condemnation of today's attack. This was among the deadliest Israeli strikes hitting both hospitals and journalists during the 22 months war in Gaza. What is the Secretary-General's message to the Israeli Government as it embarks on a new offensive to take Gaza City?
     Spokesman :  Stop.  We've been very clear in the potential horrors that a new military assault on Gaza City could bring to the Palestinians who have sought safety there. There is no place safe left in Gaza. We want to see a ceasefire.  We want to see the release of all the hostages. We want to see the humanitarian aid flow back in into Gaza so people can start rebuilding their lives, so that statement in itself seems trite in the face of what is going on and what has been going on in Gaza.  Gabriel?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  And also, thanks for the comments by the Secretary-General and the colleagues that were killed, or I should say murdered.  The Secretary-General has called for a prompt and impartial investigation.  Unfortunately, we've seen this movie before dozens of times over the past 22 months.  There is going to be no prompt and impartial investigation because Israel is the occupying Power; they won't allow it.  So given that, what can the Secretary-General do in his power to do something different this time where there will be accountability?
     Spokesman :  Look.  As everybody said, accountability in itself takes time.  The Secretary-General doesn't have the authority to launch an international investigation without a proper legislative mandate, but there will need to be accountability.  And we also, again, call on Israel to cooperate with the various mechanisms that exist, that have been set up by various bodies in this Organization in order for them to be transparent and to show that there will be accountability.  You know, it is a reminder…  I mean, I think, when it comes to journalists, there was a Security Council resolution, 2222, that was passed by the Security Council of this Organization, calling for the protection of journalists, calling on journalists to be allowed to do their work, calling on media facilities to be treated as civilian infrastructures and for journalists to be protected as civilians. It is important that this resolution be respected.
     Question :  I know that the Secretary-General doesn't have a mandate to independently send in a protection force to Gaza, but the General Assembly does.  Would he support it at this point, given the situation?
     Spokesman :  The Secretary-General will support any initiative that will help bring an end to this conflict, that will help bring humanitarian aid in, that will help see the release of all the hostages, and that will help bring us back to a two-State solution and regardless of how far away that may be.  Yes, ma'am?
     Question :  This is Minu from China Daily.  Russia has proposed that members of the UN Security Council, including US, China, and Russia, act as the security guarantor for Ukraine.  Has the SG or the United Nations taken a position on this proposal?
     Spokesman :  Well, we know there are discussions ongoing to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.  As the Secretary-General said, he would support any initiative that would see an end to the conflict in line with international law, in line with relevant UN resolutions, and respecting Ukraine's internationally recognized territorial integrity.  Dezhi, you had a question?
     Question :  Yes, Steph.  Another topic.  Today, the Foreign Minister of Syria announced that Syrian President [Ahmed] al-Sharaa will visit here in New York during UNGA (United Nations General Assembly).  We know that he's still on the list of the terrorists.  How would this issue be handled?
     Spokesman :  I'm sure it will be appropriately issued, appropriately handled by those who need to handle it.  But if he comes here, the Secretary-General, I have no doubt, will meet with him as he's met with him before.  Okay.  Any questions on in the room…  Morad?
     Question :  Thank you, Stéphane.  What are the legal consequences of the famine declaration in Gaza, if there are any?  And which entity can or should proceed to seek accountability on this?
     Spokesman :  Well, there are various legal entities and there are various cases in front of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Criminal Court (ICC) as it relates to the conflict in Gaza, as it relates to what is going on in Gaza.  We urge all Member States to cooperate with those institutions, which are independent from the Secretary-General.  For the Secretary-General's standpoint, his focus is on supporting the work of those humanitarian agencies, notably World Food Programme, UNICEF, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), WHO, who are in the lead in trying to deal with the hunger situation in Gaza.  Yes, ma'am?
     Question :  Last week, your office announced the new special envoy for the prevention of genocide?
     Spokesman :  Yes, ma'am.
     Question :  But they didn't say when he's starting.
     Spokesman :  Starting, I believe, in September, but I can double check the date. Yes?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Away from the political and peace and security to housekeeping, inside the UN. What's the latest update on the UN80 initiative? And there is locomotion in the building, and there is lots of anxiety as…  [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  There is locomotion in the building.  I'm not sure what that means, but I like that term.
     Question :  Okay.
     Spokesman :  The Secretary-General, I think, reported back to Member States and to all of you at the end of July, where we were.  I can tell you from, you know, having spoken to the Secretary-General this morning, he's very focused on it.  We'll be spending a lot of time on moving things forward over the next few weeks, before the General Assembly, so that there's more concrete plans to be presented to the General Assembly when it meets.
     Question :  So that means that any actual steps towards staff reduction is going to be…  [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  No, no, no, no.  This is a separate thing.  The Secretary-General will present revised budget to the Fifth Committee in the coming weeks.  There are, as you know, some painful staff reductions.  Those have been proposed, and will be proposed, to the General Assembly because in the end, Member States will have to take those decisions.  Dezhi?
     Question :  Sorry.  One more question.  This week, I think Security Council is going to take action on the extension of mandate of UNIFIL.
     Spokesman :  Sure hope so.
     Question :  What is the position from the Secretary-General?  What does he think of the importance of that mandate?
     Spokesman :  We've always believed that UNIFIL plays a stabilizing role, right?  The fact that the men and women of UNIFIL, at the direction of the Secretary-General, stayed during the worst part of the conflict, I think, is a testament to their bravery and to the critical role that they are especially now being able to play in the implementation of Security Council 1701.  I mean, we update you once or twice a week on everything that they're doing in cooperating and working with the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and reporting the weapons caches, the tunnels, at a pace that I think we've never we haven't seen before and supporting the LAF in terms of capacity-building even if they continue to face risks, whether it's from a cross-fire or whether it's from, as I saw, obstructions from civilians in certain parts of their area of responsibility. But in the end, the decision will be left to the wise members of the Security Council.
     Question :  But there’s a strong preference of the Secretary-General to extend the mandate.
     Spokesman :  I think if…  if you concluded that from what I've just spent the last few minutes talking, you would be correct.  Abdelhamid, I see your face on my screen.  Go ahead.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Yeah.  I have few questions.  I want to follow-up with Gabriel's question about investigation. And I always wonder, Steph, why UNESCO's (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) director, Audrey Azoulay, does not speak loud about investigation.  You may say, oh, you could direct your question to UNESCO. I failed.  I mean, I couldn't get an answer.  I want to ask her through you why UNESCO is not talking about the murder of so many journalists, when it is in her mandate.  Why?
     Spokesman :  My understanding is that they have in the past, and they will continue to speak up for the safety and the protection of journalists.  Your second question?
     Question :  My second question, isn't obvious now that the Israeli plans is to obliterate the Palestinian people as a whole? Does it take so much, I mean, thinking that the plans I mean, what [Itamar Ben] Gvir said recently, it falls into this category.  They are trying to kill the Palestinian people as a whole.  Is the SG aware of this or not?  If he is not…  It's a tragedy.
     Spokesman :  Abdelhamid, with due respect, I think the Secretary-General has been very aware about what's going on in Gaza, has been very clear, and most importantly, been very consistent in what he has been saying.  Yes, sir?
     Question :  One short question.  Don't you see that you are rewarding Israel when you borrow their lexicons and when there is a land stolen from the Palestinians?  And they change its name to sound like Hebrew.  And then do you repeat that?  Like, Karim Abu Salem.  It's a Palestinian land stolen from the Palestinians.  The Israeli gave them this name, and you are repeating…  [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  I think I have used both Karim Shalom and Karim Abu Salam at different parts times.  Okay.  On that note, go away.  Sorry.  Oh, sorry. Sorry.  Iftikhar, sorry.  I apologize. I only see Abdelhamid on the screen. But if I can hear you, Iftikhar, go ahead.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  On the floods in Pakistan and UN coordinating with the Pakistani authorities, I just wanted to know whether UN relief teams are actually on the ground in the affected area.
     Spokesman :  Sorry.  Say again?
     Question :  I said whether the UN team's relief teams are actually on the ground in the affected areas.
     Spokesman :  I will find out from our OCHA colleagues and get back to you on that.
     Question :  Right.  Thank you.
     Spokesman :  Thank you.  Okay.  Goodbye.

26) Security, Development Intertwined — Lasting Peace Demands Both, Says Deputy Secretary-General, in Remarks to African Chiefs of Defence Summit — UN Press (2025-08-25)

   Text:
     Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks on the occasion of the inaugural African Chiefs of Defence Staff Summit, in Abuja today:
     It is an honour to join you for this first-ever African Chiefs of Defence Staff Summit.  I thank General Christopher Gwabin Musa and the Government of Nigeria for your warm invitation and welcome.
     I speak as a proud African, and as someone who has seen the cost of insecurity in families and communities across our continent, from Boko Haram in Maiduguri to the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan and the conflict in Ethiopia.
     This gathering marks the birth of a new era in African security cooperation at such a critical moment.  It is the first of its kind to represent the boots on the ground and a rare opportunity to connect their realities with the policy decisions that shape our continent’s security.
     Nearly one in every five people on Earth call Africa home. Each one deserves to live in safety and dignity, that means protecting civilians, respecting borders, and standing by the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Above all, it calls for a united approach against our common threats.
     We know that Africa is the epicentre of global terrorism deaths.  Al-Qaida and Islamic State affiliates coordinate across our continent, with attacks in West Africa’s coastal countries surging 250 per cent in two years.  Violent extremism is back again in the Lake Chad Basin, in Somalia and beyond.
     By last year’s end, over 14,000 schools were closed in the Central Sahel due to conflict.  Aside from the children forcibly recruited, we see young people drawn by fear, money or false promises of belonging.  When young people see no path to education or justice, extremist propaganda finds an audience and we risk losing an entire generation.
     In this new era of technology where it should be advancing as a human endeavour, these groups are using new technologies like unmanned aerial systems and improvised explosive devices to wreak havoc.  We cannot afford to be bystanders.  Africa must take ownership, be proactive and shape how these tools are used.
     Cyberspace is now a battlespace.  Elections manipulated.  Institutions undermined.  Lies spread until neighbour turns against neighbour.
     We have seen this before.  Once it was radio carrying messages that ignited genocide.  Today it is social media, amplifying hate at terrifying speed.
     Artificial intelligence (AI) is already transforming the landscape of security.  AI tools are helping countries suffering from conflict and insecurity:  identifying food insecurity, predicting displacement caused by climate shocks, even detecting and clearing landmines.  Soon, they could help spot patterns of unrest before violence erupts.
     But, the same technology that offers solutions also carries profound risks.  AI’s expansion into security systems raises fundamental questions about human rights, dignity and the rule of law — from autonomous border surveillance to predictive policing.
     It creates fertile ground for misunderstanding, miscalculation and mistakes.  AI-enabled cyberattacks could cripple critical infrastructure and paralyse essential services.  Algorithms are already being used to make life-and-death decisions.
     Climate change is also reshaping the geography of security across our continent.  Fuelling food scarcity.  Endangering our people.  Extreme heat, sea-level rise and shifting rainfall patterns are driving displacement, exacerbating resource competition and fuelling instability.  Shrinking water levels in the Lake Chad Basin have displaced 3 million people.  I saw this first-hand when I was Minister of Environment.  The evidence is overwhelming:  [climate change] is destabilizing our world.
     The UN Security Council has acknowledged that climate change is a threat multiplier that fuels conflict, displaces populations and undermines State stability.  The International Court of Justice recognized climate change as an urgent and existential threat to our world.  And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has left no room for doubt:  Africa is among the most exposed regions in the world.
     The ripple effect is rising displacement and migration, putting food systems and infrastructure under even more pressure and creating more openings for instability and exploitation.  The result speaks volumes:  climate change is a clear and present danger to peace.
     Our seas are also becoming a new front line.  Organized crime on our waters is feeding violence on our land.  In the Gulf of Guinea, piracy and illicit trade are funding terrorism.  In the Red Sea, maritime insecurity is undermining stability far beyond the shoreline.
     Each of these threats all share one characteristic:  they are transnational.  Our response must be, too.  When we act in isolation, we hand our adversaries their greatest advantage:  our division.  Regional cooperation is the linchpin of African security and defence. But, we also know this is easier said than done.
     Defence collaboration is not simple.  We are talking about 54 countries, each with their own policies, histories and priorities.  That makes it all the more remarkable that through that complexity and diversity African forces find ways to act together, and you have.
     From the African Union’s peace support operations, to Algeria’s African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism, Cape Verde’s Centre for Security and Transnational Organized Crime and Cameroon’s International School for Security Forces.
     The African Union deploys peace support operations where others cannot or will not.  The Multinational Joint Taskforce in the Lake Chad Basin coordinates regional efforts against Boko Haram.  The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in West Africa and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in the Horn [of Africa] are coordinating troops, logistics and political engagement.  The G5 Sahel [Group of Five for the Sahel] and the Accra Initiative have also played important roles.
     But, too often, such initiatives are being held back by mistrust, tensions and gaps in coordination.  Trust is not built overnight, but without it, every effort to strengthen our partnerships and our response in defence of our people will fall short.  Collaboration must be targeted and intentional.  I see three pillars where our unity can tip the balance.
     First:  Resources. Pooling our budgets for joint responses makes us stronger than scattered spending.  We proved this when Nigeria helped in the Gambia and Liberia.  We must find that spirit again.
     At the same time, we need to think bigger about financing.  National security budgets must be complemented by international support.  We can leverage the prevention components of other budgets to reinforce stability and reduce the costs of conflict before they spiral.
     Cutting off illicit financing is part of this battlefront.  The Intergovernmental Action Group against Money-Laundering in West Africa’s anti-money laundering work, and cooperation through the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission, are vital to choke off the money flows that sustain conflict.
     Second:  Intelligence and innovation.  We need the right tools and mapping in place to plan and drive strategy.  Reinforcing the Accra Initiative, the ECOWAS Standby Force and giving the Joint Threat Fusion and Analysis Cell the support it needs will ensure data becomes decisions.  The same applies at sea — joint patrols that make the Yaoundé Architecture real protection for people and infrastructure.
     And innovation must be part of our defence.  Collaborating on AI, from drones to cybertools and building on the African Union’s new AI Strategy, can help us set common standards to keep technology serving people.
     Third:  People and partnerships.  Our continent is full of military and academic centres of excellence.  We need to harness that training capacity, use it more efficiently and deploy it where it is most needed — and we must unite the public and private sectors.  Soldiers learning side by side with engineers, technicians and innovators.  Regular fora with business to share cutting-edge knowledge.  This is how Africa’s own labs and companies can power our security future.  In turn, the private sector benefits from access to credit to grow their companies and feed their bottom line.
     History has shown that African military collaboration has already proven itself on the world stage.  Three decades ago, Ghana and Nigeria pioneered the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group ECOMOG in Liberia when regional interventions were untested.  African military diplomacy stepped into the breach when others hesitated.  From those West African origins, the tradition expanded across Sierra Leone, Mali and beyond.  Rwanda transformed from recovery to becoming the number two global contributor of peacekeeping forces.
     Today, 9 of the world’s top 15 contributors to UN peacekeeping are African nations and African troops are active in Somalia, in the Central African Republic and in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  So, we are not only recipients of support from the international community — we are contributors of support, and without African leadership there would be no effective peacekeeping.
     Now, peacekeeping is entering a new era.  However, this era is facing serious headwinds.  Politically, the UN Security Council is deadlocked and political support is eroding.  Meanwhile, external actors are pursuing their own agendas on African soil, complicating our security landscape.
     Financially, missions are underfunded.  This makes resolution 2719 (2023) so vital.  With this resolution, the UN Security Council acknowledged a simple truth:  African crises demand African leadership, backed by global financial support.
     This new era of peacekeeping also brings with it an opportunity for a new face.  It has to be younger, more diverse in people and skills that will work with communities on the front and the day after.  That includes women.  On the day after, women are the anchors of recovery helping to rebuild trust and heal communities long after the guns fall silent.
     The day after also demands something else from us as military leaders.  Justice and accountability matter the day after.  Everyone deserves their day in court — even accused terrorists, as difficult as it may be to accept, must face justice in a court of law.  These are some of the issues the international community will raise, and as leaders you will have to have a position that you can defend.
     Let’s be reminded why we need peace — for development.  Without it, neither the Sustainable Development Goals nor Agenda 2063 can be achieved.  Farmers cannot farm without security.  Energy systems cannot be built without protected infrastructure.  Every school, every hospital, depends on security.  We cannot have girls in fear of kidnapping.
     Without security, development is impossible.  Without development, security cannot hold.  Lasting peace must be built on both.  Both are the foundation of the 2030 Agenda and Africa’s vision in Agenda 2063.  They connect the dots between prosperity, good governance and peace:  food security, education, healthcare, decent work, social protection, green technology, resilience, justice and institutions people can trust.
     We know that every additional year of schooling reduces the likelihood of a young person joining armed groups by up to 13 per cent. This evidence begs the question:  How do we invest in peace?  Is it military spending?  Is it development spending?  Is it both? That is the discussion we need to have in this room.
     That means tackling root causes.  It means democracy that is robust and representative.  Not unconstitutional changes dressed up as solutions.  While this might seem legitimate in many eyes, in the longer term, democracy, and by extension security, is weakened.
     Instead, strong institutions underpinned by strong democracies and a strong security apparatus are the safeguard against instability.  Let’s give some deep thought to the resources we are allocating to achieve stability.  Last year, the world spent $2.7 trillion on the military — more than at any point in history.  Yet insecurity has not diminished.  Conflicts are spreading, not shrinking.
     At the same time, the world fell short by $4 trillion each year for basic development needs.  Four trillion missing for schools, jobs and clinics.  That imbalance raises a clear question:  what kind of spending truly delivers the peace you are fighting to protect?
     This is at the heart of the African Union’s call to silence the guns.  Because silencing the guns is not only about weapons laid down.  It is about investing in people, tackling root causes and creating societies where stability is built on justice, opportunity and trust.
     Success will only be possible if we create fiscal space for investment in people and stability.  We need fairer finance:  debt relief, affordable credit and a global system that works for Africa as it is today. We need a global financial architecture that reflects today’s realities.  And we need African countries strong and united in calling for these changes.
     Strategic defence collaboration is not a slogan, it is the bridge between the threats we face today and the peace we promise tomorrow. I have seen the challenge.  I have also seen what’s possible when we find common ground.
     The outcomes of this week must be heard beyond this room. They must be carried into every international forum where decisions on defence are made.  That is how we shape Africa’s security on Africa’s terms.
     But, reshaping security also means changing mindsets.  We must see women not only as victims of war, but as partners in peace.  Just as women look for peace in their homes, they must be part of the search for peace on the warfront.  This is not only about winning wars.  It is about winning peace, together.
     As Nelson Mandela [Madiba] said:  “I dream of the realization of the unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine in their efforts to solve the problems of this continent.”  That dream calls on us to act, with resolve, with trust, and with shared purpose to safeguard the future of Africa, for Africans.

27) Ocean Biodiversity Treaty’s Preparatory Commission Revisits Agreement’s Clearing-House Mechanism, Relationship with Global Environment Facility — UN Press (2025-08-25)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sea2241.doc.htm
   Text:
     The commission charged with preparing for the entry into force of a new treaty on marine biodiversity resumed today its consideration of the mechanism by which information about treaty-related activities will be shared amongst States, with delegates debating the tasks, composition and working methods for the informal group of experts that will be responsible for its operationalization.
     That treaty was adopted on 19 June 2023, is open for signature until 20 September 2025, and will enter into force whenever it receives 60 instruments of ratification, approval, acceptance or accession thereto — currently eight more are needed.
     From 18 to 29 August, UN Headquarters is hosting the second of three gatherings of the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     Under the Agreement, a Clearing-House Mechanism is to be established to serve as a centralized, open-access platform to enable parties to access, provide and disseminate information with respect to treaty activities.  Aiding today’s discussion were revised draft terms of reference prepared by the Commission’s Co-Chairs on the creation of an informal group of experts dedicated to operationalizing that Mechanism (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.2 ).  The document accounts for discussions and written input on this topic to date.
     As the Commission considered the tasks with which the informal group of experts will be charged, the Russian Federation’s representative asked delegates to reflect on the appropriate name for this group.  She emphasized that “this is, first and foremost, not a working group — but an expert group”.
     Along those lines, Vanuatu’s delegate, who spoke for Pacific small island developing States, expressed concern over the use of the term “scientific” in relation to the group’s proposed activities — as the term “technical” is broad and would cover many areas.  The speaker for Norway, whose delegation proposed that language, explained that the intent was distinguish “between the political and the scientific and the technical”.  As the term “technical” would also cover “scientific”, he said that his delegation “could go forward” with removing references to the latter term.  “The most important thing is that the group deliver technical advice to the Preparatory Commission and not political advice,” he underscored.
     With respect to the group’s activities, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, expressed flexibility, but noted a slight preference for language that would task the informal expert group with preparing a comparative assessment of existing multilateral clearing-house mechanisms with similar functions to that called for in the Agreement.  She said that the bloc holds this position “because it seems to be more feasible in the time constraints for the expert group that we have”.
     Japan’s delegate, however, expressed concern over adding such a comparative assessment “on top of the other tasks already prescribed”.  Instead, she voiced support for language calling on the group to “take stock” of existing mechanisms to use as a baseline, with the representatives of Canada and the Philippines in agreement.  New Zealand’s delegate noted that, while a comparative report would be an additional task, it is wise to learn lessons from other clearing-house mechanisms.  “Taking stock of existing mechanisms and platforms provides a practical and efficient basis for developing a roadmap for operationalization of the Clearing-House Mechanism,” said Türkiye’s representative.
     Meanwhile, Australia’s representative expressed concern over both options, stating that his delegation was “very reluctant to micromanage the expert group on its work when it reviews the existing clearing-house mechanisms” and therefore did not prefer language requiring a comparative assessment.  However, he also noted that language tasking the group with taking stock of existing mechanisms — and then using this as a baseline for developing a road map to operationalize the Agreement’s Clearing-House Mechanism — is potentially problematic because existing mechanisms “are potentially different” from the one envisioned by the Agreement.
     Maldives’ delegate added:  “It is important that the informal working group has a clear direction on where the Preparatory Commission needs guidance.”  Samoa’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said that, while undertaking a comparative assessment would help to inform the group’s guidance and recommendations to the Commission, “a stocktake — on its own — might not sufficiently inform this work”.
     The representative of Kenya, speaking for the African Group, stressed the need to “remain mindful of the limited time available” for the informal expert group to complete its mandate and deliver its report 120 days before the Preparatory Commission’s third session.  She therefore stressed the need for efficient, inclusive working methods.  Regarding the reference to the “guidance and advice” the group is to provide the Preparatory Commission, she stressed that it must be made clear that any outputs “remain in the nature of recommendations”.
     With respect to the technical aspects of the group’s work, Thailand’s delegate voiced concern that the draft terms of reference “at the moment is too descriptive”, stating:  “If we are going to task an informal group or set up a group to work on behalf of us, we should trust them.”  He added:  “They should be able to interpret the text of the Agreement and Mechanism designed by the Agreement.”
     Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s representative noted that, while “the substance of what the Clearing-House Mechanism needs to cover are set out in the Agreement”, the technical details in the draft terms of reference describe “how is this going to work on the ground for the users”.  Her delegation is “comfortable this is not expanding what’s in the Agreement or changing it”, she added.
     Delegations also elaborated on other aspects of the informal expert group, including its deliverables, with Canada’s representative expressing preference for the term “initial” versus “pilot” to describe the phase of the Mechanism’s operationalization on which the group would focus.  The latter, he pointed out, usually connotes “a testing period”.  Mexico’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group — which proposed the term “pilot” — said that “initial” is acceptable.  He stressed, however, that “the operationalization of the Mechanism is an ongoing process; it’s not going to be interrupted at some point”.
     Indonesia’s representative expressed support for the deletion of language concerning the group’s tasks relating to marine genetic resources and environmental-impact assessments.  However, Cuba’s delegate pointed out that language referring to marine genetic resources, benefit-sharing and environmental-impact assessments are not reflected elsewhere, and must be retained.
     An observer for the High Seas Alliance noted that the timeline and sequencing envisioned in the draft terms of reference is still keyed to the third session of the Preparatory Commission, which is scheduled to meet two to three months after the likely entry into force of the Agreement in January. To address this, he proposed that the current Preparatory Commission — in addition to discussing the draft terms of reference — develop separate instructions for interim arrangements to cover that initial gap.
     In the afternoon, the Commission continued its exchange of views on the revised draft terms of reference, then turning to a refreshed draft memorandum of understanding between the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement and the Council of the Global Environment Facility (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.1 ).
     Some disagreement emerged concerning preambular paragraph 9 of that document, which refers to provisions in the Agreement setting out the general principles and approaches by which Parties to the Agreement shall be guided.  Further, the paragraph in question goes on to refer to the special circumstances of small island developing States and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.
     The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, while voicing support for the reference to the Agreement, said:  “We do not see the need for insisting in the memorandum of understanding on certain principles more than on others.”  Brazil’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, reserved the right to return with additional comments on the added value of outlining those particular principles.
     However, the representative of Papua New Guinea, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, voiced strong support for the inclusion of references to the special circumstances of small island developing States, as well as to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  He pointed out that the special circumstances of those States are mentioned 20 times in the Agreement — with the article concerning funding mentioning this five times.  “Which reminds me of that joke:  ‘New York, New York — a town so nice they named it twice’,” he said.
     The Agreement is replete with references to special circumstances, he continued, adding that such references are relevant in the memorandum of understanding, as well.  Further, he stressed:  “Indigenous People are rights-holders, they’re not stakeholders or civil society.”  Therefore, their rights need to be recognized, and that principle needs to be included in the memorandum.  The representatives of Canada and Antigua and Barbuda, the latter of whom spoke for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), expressed support for that position.
     For her part, the Russian Federation’s delegate said that, unfortunately, the financing mechanism in the Agreement has become intertwined with the Global Environmental Facility, which works in a non-transparent way.  Before finalizing the memorandum, “we need to come to grips with how the funds are allocated for the needs of the Agreement”, she said.  “It is unclear why we have this text,” every provision of which requires additional clarification, she added.
     The Preparatory Commission will reconvene on Tuesday, 26 August, to discuss the selection process for members of the Scientific and Technical Body and other subsidiary bodies to be established under the Agreement, as well as the operationalization of other provisions on financing.

28) General Assembly Debates Global Health Challenges, Report of Youth Office, Takes Action on Drafts on Several Topics — UN Press (2025-08-25)

   Text:
     The General Assembly today adopted several resolutions, including one endorsing the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development held in Seville, Spain from 30 June to 3 July 2025.
     By a recorded vote of 158 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with one abstention (Argentina), the Assembly adopted that resolution (document A/79/L.109 ), backing the Sevilla Commitment , which sets out more than 130 concrete actions to mobilize development resources.
     Speaking before its adoption, many delegations voiced their support for the conference which brought together over 50 world leaders, but several other speakers pointed out areas of disagreement and contention.  Denmark’s delegate, speaking for the European Union in its capacity as observer, reaffirmed strong support for the outcome document but formally disassociated from two paragraphs.  On paragraph 50(F), the bloc warned that duplicating existing debt frameworks would “foster uncertainty, reduce predictability, and fragment the architecture”, undermining progress for low-income countries.  On paragraph 16, the climate finance language did not reflect the Paris Agreement on climate change’s principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.
     Palau’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the Sevilla Commitment is “a concrete affirmation to address the deeply entrenched inequities and shortfalls in the international financial architecture”.  It provides a renewed mandate to expedite implementation of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for small island developing States, advance the multidimensional vulnerability index as a tool for fairer access to concessional finance, operationalize the Debt Sustainability Support Service to build lasting solutions and recognize ocean finance as crucial to development. “Commitments must now be translated into action, and action into impact”, she stressed.
     Iraq’s delegate, speaking for the Group of 77 and China, welcomed the Commitment’s recognition of the $4 trillion financing gap and pledged to mobilize affordable, predictable financing, references to the right to development, stronger language on domestic resources, private sector finance, official development assistance (ODA), and climate finance.  At the same time, the Group regretted the absence of explicit commitments on “Leaving no one behind”, climate finance obligations under the Paris Agreement, and key priorities on trade, investment reform, and addressing unilateral measures.
     The Assembly went on to adopt a draft decision on “Participation of non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, academic institutions and the private sector in the ‘World Social Summit’ under the title ‘the Second World Summit for Social Development’ (document A/79/L.115 ).  Prior to its adoption, it also adopted the text’s draft amendment (document A/79/L.120 ), by a recorded vote of 64 in favour to 26 against, with 37 abstentions, that replaces its annex.  Introducing the amendment, the United Kingdom’s delegate stressed the important role of civil society in the multilateral process.
     By a text titled “Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia — residual functions” (document A/79/L.116/Rev.1 ), introduced by France’s delegate, the Assembly encouraged the Secretary-General and Cambodia to implement the Addendum to the Agreement on the Extraordinary Chambers, ensuring completion of residual functions and a smooth transition to a new Cambodian institution.  It further requested consultations to determine whether any residual functions remain and asked the Secretary-General to report back to the Assembly on the matter.
     “Global health is a universal right for rich and poor alike”, said the representative of Venezuela, speaking for the Group of Friends in Defense of the UN Charter on improving international cooperation and multilateral efforts to address global health challenges and promote equity in health for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the Assembly discussed earlier in the day.  “No country or region acting in isolation […] will be able to meet the urgent needs of their people,” he said.
     Further, he condemned “unilateral coercive measures” as “mass violations of human rights” and urged their immediate repeal, while denouncing United States efforts to discredit Cuban medical cooperation and praising Cuban doctors for saving lives worldwide.  On Gaza, the Group warned that “attacks have […] prompted the collapse of the health system” and called for urgent UN action to uphold the Palestinian people’s rights to health, food, and peace.
     The European Union’s representative said “global health and foreign policy are deeply interconnected” and “multilateralism to tackle health issues is delivering results”. “Urgent political action is needed to address the alarming stagnation of progress towards universal health coverage,” he said.  Likewise “strong multilateral cooperation and a robust multilateral health architecture, with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core, are essential”.
     Echoing that point, Thailand’s representative, speaking for the seven members of the Foreign Policy and Global Health (FPGH) Initiative, stressed:  “The spread of COVID-19 has reminded us that a threat to health anywhere is a threat to health everywhere”.  Pointing to the continued human cost and suffering from global health emergencies, he said:  “We must close the health gap faced by the poorest and the most vulnerable, eliminate structural inequalities, integrate environmental protection into public health priorities and catalyse regulatory and fiscal measures to support health objectives.”  Accordingly, he urged adequate, predictable and sustainable health financing.
     “Health is a fundamental human right and a central pillar of sustainable development,” underscored Iraq’s delegate, speaking for the Group of 77 and China.  Rising costs of health technologies and limited national capacities compound these gaps in access to medical equipment, vaccines, diagnostics, and health technologies that continue to disproportionately affect developing countries.  Yet the global response remains insufficient to meet the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda.  He urged increased investment in science, technology, and innovation, and for the implementation of initiatives in critical sectors such as health — where shortages are “particularly acute” and the migration of skilled professionals risks further weakening national systems.
     “In Cuba, health is a human right, enshrined in the Constitution”, said that country’s delegate, adding that “global health cannot be unlinked from political tensions, humanitarian emergencies or the unjust and unequal global economic order”. Citing multilateralism as “essential” to providing effective responses to global health emergencies and delivering true universal healthcare coverage, he said developed countries have an “inescapable debt” that they owe.  “Selfishness must be eliminated from international relations”, along with unilateral coercive measures, which negatively impact the enjoyment of the right to health, he affirmed.
     “Countries of the Global South should not choose between paying the suffocating external debts or financing their national healthcare systems,” he observed, calling for mutual support to build resilient, universal, and humane healthcare systems that are “not governed by the logic of the market”.  While $2.7 trillion is spent on military expenditures, 4.5 billion people worldwide lack access to basic healthcare services, and 2 billion are facing economic hardships due to the expenses of healthcare, he said, pointing to the collapse of the healthcare system in Palestine.
     Zambia’s delegate said “global health, foreign policy and sustainable development are inextricably linked” and that COVID-19 revealed “structural inequalities in access to vaccines, medicine and life-saving technology”.   “No country should be left behind,” he said, urging renewed global commitment and strengthened partnership to build a more equitable future for all.
     On the topic of the Secretary-General’s report on the UN Youth Office (document A/79/986 ), Kuwait’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, stressed that “investing in youth is not a luxury, but a necessity”.  He highlighted the Office’s impact despite limited resources, working with 60 UN agencies and 132 national teams.   The Group welcomed phase two of the UN Youth Strategy 2025–2030, placing young people “at the heart of achieving the SDGs” and ensuring accountability so that “the voice of youth will be turned into tangible actions”.  Also key is youth participation in peacebuilding, climate policies, and UN processes, as is protection from reprisals, expanded training and recruitment, and partnerships to build a fairer and more sustainable future.
     “Young persons are not only beneficiaries, but first and foremost essential partners in building sustainable, peaceful, and inclusive societies”, added the speaker for the European Union.  “It is important for youth participation to move beyond symbolism”, she asserted, adding that it must be institutionalized, inclusive and adequately resourced. Accordingly, she reiterated the bloc’s commitment to supporting the UN Youth Office in its efforts to strengthen accountability, broaden access and safeguard the participation of young persons, noting its ongoing contribution of €1 million to that end.
     Also welcoming the UN Youth Office’s 2025–2028 plan, the Philippines' delegate stressed that youth are “agents of change” central to peace and sustainable development.  She highlighted national initiatives like the Philippine Youth Development Plan, and programmes on internships, entrepreneurship, and inclusive education and underscored commitment to child protection and youth participation in multilateral fora.
     Kazakhstan’s speaker said the record-breaking attendance at the 2025 Economic and Social Council Youth Forum and the convening of Youth Action Day at the Summit of the Future, which engaged over 2,400 young participants, are testaments to the Office's growing role as “a central convener for youth voices”.  He further welcomed the launch of Youth2030 Phase 2, which introduces a results framework and six strategic priorities to expedite implementation of the UN Youth Strategy, citing the development of a system-wide youth marker to track investments as “a critical step” towards ensuring that “our commitments translate into tangible results for young people on the ground”.
     Lastly turning to the matter of Security Council reform to be taken up Tuesday, 25 August, the representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking for the “L.69 Group”, commended the leadership of the Intergovernmental Negotiations co-chairs and the constructive discussions held over the past nine months.  At the same time, he voiced concern that the revised co-chairs’ elements paper does not fully reflect Member States’ positions, noting mischaracterizations of the negotiations’ process, mention of new cross-regional groupings, and the absence of explicit support for expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories — despite this being the majority view.  She called for urgent work on a consolidated model to pave the way for text-based negotiations in the eightieth session, stressing that only a transparent, inclusive, and results-oriented process can deliver meaningful reform of the Security Council.
     “The time has come for continued demonstration of renewed political will to reform the Security Council and show its relevance and legitimacy in today’s world,” stated Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking for the African Union. The Pact for the Future generated a new sense of optimism for genuine progress on Security Council reform, he observed, underlining the need to address historical injustice suffered by the continent and to treat Africa as “a special case and priority”.  In this context, he recalled the adoption of the African Union’s reform model — this significant milestone reflects the continent’s unity and commitment to advance the common African position.
     In other matters, the Assembly  extended the appointment of Rebeca Grynspan as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for a further two-year term of office, from 12 September 2025 to 11 September 2027.  Ms. Grynspan was initially confirmed into that role on 12 September 2021.
