     Last week in my small rural town, St George’s flags were erected from lamp-posts and crudely daubed on roundabouts and zebra crossings, while residents were subjected to “Sieg Heil” as a mob walked along the streets. Downing Street has put out a statement that patriotism is important, while Joanne Monk, the Reform UK leader of Worcestershire city council, also emphasised pride in the flag. I have nothing against the flag per se, but when Nazi thugs use it to demonstrate and catcall, it morphs into something else entirely. As a Black person, I have been subject to abuse three times in the past fortnight. My 12-year-old child and his friend were called “paedos” at school – they are the only Black children in the class – and a friend’s child was called the N-word on the bus (this was before the summer recess). To be Black in the countryside at the moment is to have a target on your back. There are real-world consequences of constantly demonising Black and Brown people in the media, racialising crimes and acting as if the most vulnerable people in our society – asylum seekers – are the reasons your energy bills are too high or you can’t afford your food shop. Nigel Farage and his acolytes know what they are doing with their disinformation and division campaign, and the media should be ashamed of giving them so much airtime. As Rafael Behr notes (There’s an obvious way to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do it, 27 August), the distraction technique is a well-worn part of Farage’s playbook. A strong prime minister would call him out, not mimic him. If he gets into Downing Street in 2029, as some pollsters predict, we will only have ourselves to blame. Name and address supplied • I am surprised that someone who asked their neighbour to take down an England flag is astonished by their refusal to do so (Letters, 26 August). But why would they comply? The flag is not obscene, offensive or inappropriate; it is the flag of England being flown in England. I do not recall similar objections when Ukrainian flags appeared in windows in a display of solidarity. Nor do such debates arise when the England men’s football team enjoys success, prompting a surge of flags in cars, pubs and homes. And the union jacks along the Mall in London rarely attract controversy. To equate the St George’s cross with extremism is a mistake. Suppressing its display does not challenge intolerance, it merely silences legitimate expressions of national identity. Surely the more constructive approach is to foster open discussion rather than to remove symbols. If one chooses to live in England, one should reasonably expect to see England’s flag flown with pride. There is nothing inherently wrong in expressing affection for one’s own country. Name and address supplied • I live on a terrace of 16 houses. A couple of years ago, one of our neighbours put up a St George’s cross. At first, the flag seemed football-related, but they left it flying indefinitely. As such a powerful signifier of patriotism, many of us felt it gave our terrace a distorted and unwanted image. It then occurred to us that we could drown out that cultural noise by us all flying flags. Ten houses participated. We made poles from fishing rods and bamboo. I chose the flag of Jamaica to represent my partly Caribbean family. There were flags from the Philippines, Scotland, Spain, rainbows and doves, and we raised them as high as possible above the union flag. On breezy, sunny days they made our terrace seem like a festival of difference. Many people asked residents what we were celebrating. Our answer was that “we are from everywhere”. The St George’s cross couple soon left and our community settled back into its peaceful ways. Jane Ryan Woodbridge, Suffolk • Further to the very interesting letters about the current rash of flags, has anyone noticed that nearly all the ones on tall lamp-posts are flying at half mast? Is it just that flag-flyers don’t have cherry pickers, or are we unconsciously in mourning for the decline of compassion and decency? Michael Pyke Lichfield, Staffordshire • It’s heartening to see so many lads supporting the England women’s team in the Rugby World Cup with their street flags. Hugh Coolican Broughton Astley, Leicestershire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2) Norway signs £10bn deal for anti-submarine warships built in UK — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

     Norway has agreed a £10bn deal for anti-submarine warships that will be built in the UK, as the two countries plan joint operations in northern Europe to deal with increased Russian activity. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the agreement to build Type 26 frigates was the UK’s biggest ever warship export deal by value, and Norway’s biggest defence procurement deal. It said that overall it would provide a £10bn boost to the UK economy and support 4,000 jobs across the UK “well into the 2030s”. The Type 26 frigates will be built at the BAE Systems shipyards in Glasgow, which are already constructing eight of the warships for the Royal Navy. “This £10bn deal is what our plan for change is about,” said the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. “Creating jobs, driving growth and protecting national security for working people. The export of our world-leading Type 26 frigates will do exactly that, supporting well-paid jobs up and down the United Kingdom, from apprentices to engineers.” It is estimated that the shipbuilding programme will support 432 businesses, including 103 in Scotland, 47 in the north-west of England and 35 in the West Midlands. The deal also signals a strengthening of a long-term strategic relationship with Norway, as part of which a combined fleet of 13 frigates will operate jointly in northern Europe. Eight of the frigates will be British and “at least” five will be Norwegian, with the joint operation designed to “significantly strengthen Nato’s northern flank”. “This historic defence deal deepens our strategic partnership,” said John Healey, the defence secretary. “With Norway, we will train, operate, deter and – if necessary – fight together. Our navies will work as one, leading the way in Nato, with this deal putting more world-class warships in the north Atlantic to hunt Russian submarines, protect our critical infrastructure and keep both our nations secure.” Concerns over critical infrastructure around Europe have been raised on multiple occasions in the last year, after the alleged sabotage of the Baltic gas pipeline and undersea internet cables between Finland and Estonia. Norway was the only other country to participate in the UK carrier strike group’s full deployment this year, and it also collaborates with the UK and Nato partners to safeguard critical undersea infrastructure in northern Europe. “Norway and the United Kingdom are close allies with common interests and strong bilateral ties,” said Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway’s prime minister. “I am confident that the strategic partnership with the UK for purchasing, developing and operating frigates is the right decision.” The Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, said the decision showed the “tremendous success” of Scotland’s shipbuilding industry and was an example of another “defence dividend” for the country. The Type 26 frigate features sophisticated weapons, and advanced sensors and communications. Its design enables the warship to be upgraded to “counter emerging threats”, according to the MoD’s statement announcing the deal. Charles Woodburn, the chief executive of BAE Systems, said: “The Norwegian government’s decision reflects its confidence in British industry’s ability to deliver a superior anti-submarine warfare platform, together with systems and equipment, that will support its future maritime security and reinforce its position within Nato.”

3) Elizabeth Terland fires Manchester United a step closer to Women’s Champions League — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Maya Le Tissier praised her teammates for “fighting for the badge” after Manchester United moved a step closer to reaching the Women’s Champions League by edging past Hammarby in Stockholm in a nervy second qualifying round tie. Elisabeth Terland’s fourth goal in two games was enough to see United progress, as she continued her good form after scoring a hat-trick in their previous qualifying fixture on Wednesday, a 4-0 win over PSV. Saturday’s tie was a far less one-sided affair, though, as the Swedish side Hammarby provided a tricky test for United, and Le Tissier, the United captain, knew the visitors’ defensive work had been key. “It was an intense game,” Le Tissier told MUTV. “They [Hammarby] are really, really physical, good on the break and good on the counter. Their speciality is crosses and they were really good at that, but we defended really well. Everyone got together and it was a proper team effort to stay connected. [We] fought for the badge and fought for the win. We were solid today. I’m really proud of the players.” Manchester United have never played in the main draw of the Women’s Champions League and are now just a two-legged knockout tie away from doing so, after Saturday’s crucial win. Terland found the breakthrough in the 61st minute after Celin Bizet’s right-ring cross was cleverly flicked back across the penalty area by Melvine Malard to Terland, who squeezed the ball into the net at the near post. The cross and then the assist from Malard were two much-needed moments of quality in a game that had been closely fought and lacking in decisiveness in either penalty area. As a result of the goal Marc Skinner’s side have beaten the hosts of this mini-tournament of four teams – which had the rather long-winded name of second qualifying round league path group one – played at the Swedish side’s 3Arena venue. Hammarby were backed by more than 5,000 noisy supporters but Skinner’s team were undeterred by that disadvantage and stayed patient as they searched for their breakthrough. It was not the most inspiring of performances from United and they will need to improve if they are to progress through the third qualifying round and join Chelsea and the defending champions, Arsenal, in the new league phase. United should have opened the scoring earlier. In the third minute, Ella Toone had cut the ball back into Terland’s path inside the area but her shot was saved. Anna Sandberg also went close 15 minutes later when she rifled a left-foot strike just over the bar. Five minutes into the second half, Bizet broke through but could not beat the goalkeeper and Malard rushed a half-volleyed effort on the rebound. However, Hammarby had come closest to scoring in the first half when, 28 minutes in, Sofia Reidy struck the bar from inside the area after the ball fell kindly to her. Once they had got their noses in front, United managed the game well and calmly saw out the victory. They will learn their third qualifying round opponents in Sunday’s draw, possibly a big name such as Real Madrid or Roma. The Manchester United winger Bizet added to MUTV: “It was not an easy game. Hammarby are physical, fast and they know what they’re doing out there. They have a back five with a lot of rotation. It was a tough game but I felt we had control in the last 30 minutes. Win 1-0, it’s all we need. “It’s been a long summer, with the Euros, and we have some injuries now, a few, so we are just working proper hard. It’s been four days now with two games and not many subs, so we’re tired but we work hard, so give the credit to the girls and the staff.” United will be in action again next Sunday, when they begin their Women’s Super League campaign at home to currently managerless Leicester.

4) Leeds 0-0 Newcastle: Premier League – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Ross Heppenstall was at Elland Road. Here’s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM. Daniel Farke’s turn to speak to Sky. “I’m a happy man tonight … four points from three matches … a really competitive game … two games here at home, four points, two clean sheets … this is how you need to approach a season as a newly promoted side … difficult to beat … a tight game … we had bigger chances … rock solid … we need to do a bit more in the offence … I’m pretty happy today … we made it difficult for Newcastle … this is a side who plays at Champions League level … I’m pretty happy with the point … happy with the clean sheet … don’t want to be too critical that we didn’t score a goal today … we are happy with the start but we don’t lean back, we keep the foot on the gas … keep going.” As for the last couple of days of the transfer frenzy … “We would need to add some more quality up front … be good to have some options … we need to stay awake until the last hour of this window.” Leeds midfielder Sean Longstaff, who spent 18 years at his boyhood club Newcastle, talks to Sky. “It was a bit strange … I thoroughly enjoyed it … some of my best friends are in that dressing room … so I didn’t speak to them for a few days, which was really weird! … thoroughly enjoyed the game … it was competitive … I loved it … Newcastle have some of the best travelling fans in the world … but I’m lucky enough to join a club whose fans are just as good, if not better! … both really passionate fanbases and it’s a pleasure to play in front of both of them … it was really tough [to leave Newcastle] … when you look at it without emotion involved, this move was a really good one for me … it’s a massive football club … a big project … we know it will be tough to stay in the league but we have signed well … leaving Newcastle for the very first time was really sad … lots of tears from both sides … getting on for 27 you want to play as many games as possible and for me, I thought this was the best place to do it … [the start of the season] has been very positive.” Sky then offer Howe the chance to wax lyrical over Newcastle’s new signing Nick Woltemade. “He’s a really good technician … his size will be a talking point because he’s obviously a big presence … but he’s not really a target man … although he can head the ball … it’s his creativity around the box … his link play … dribbles really well for someone so big … real creativity … he will find passes not many others can see … he will add a dimension we currently don’t have … generally that will lift confidence … you have to have lots of strings to your bow to be successful in England, and he has them.” As for what’s left of the transfer window … “Not sure … there are no guarantees … we will keep working … genuinely we’re a lot stronger squad-wise than we were last year … fingers crossed we might do some more” What next for Isak? “I don’t know … I’m not party to any talks going on … I will find out like everybody else.” Regarding the imminent closure of the transfer window, Howe adds: “That will be huge for us … we are looking forward to that clarity … what our squad looks like … the noise around us can’t have been easy for the players … once we have clarity, we move forward and I’m sure we can do really well this year … long term the team looks pretty good.” Eddie Howe, drenched to the skin with West Yorkshire rain, speaks to Sky Sports. “Defensively we were very strong … really good in the three games so far in that respect … we’ve got work to do at the other end of the pitch … it’s really unlike us … historically free-scoring … good chance creation … today it wasn’t there … we have to do better with what we have … but when you lose the quality of player we have … Anthony Gordon, Joelinton, of course Alex [Isak] … take those three away and you are going to suffer slightly … we need to do better.” The xG of that match was 0.59-0.42. The lowest of any game so far this season, and even that sounds generous. … so this is how the Premier League looks after today’s round of matches. Leeds will be perfectly content with their haul of four points from their first three games; that’s two more than Newcastle, whose slow start continues. You could make an argument for Newcastle deserving to win the matches against Aston Villa and Liverpool; they didn’t do so well tonight, though, well snuffed out as they were by Leeds, for whom Dominic Calvert-Lewin buzzed around infectiously on his league debut for the club. It wasn’t a classic, and a draw seems a fair result. Newly promoted Leeds will be the happier with their point; their fans certainly sound pleased enough. Both clubs now switch their attention to the final two days of the transfer window. 90 min +5: On Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher names Sean Longstaff as his player of the match. 90 min +4: Now it’s Osula’s turn to disappoint from the wing. He shanks into the stand from a promising position on the right. 90 min +3: Harrison sneaks past Livramento on the left. He should probably do more than just win a corner, but can’t tee up anyone in the middle. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece, which Pope claims without fuss. 90 min +2: Newcastle press Leeds back awhile, but Calvert-Lewin snaffles the ball and powers upfield, laying off to Harrison who buys a cheap free kick to release the pressure. Calvert-Lewin has been very impressive. 90 min +1: The first of six additional minutes. 90 min: From the resulting throw, Bogle jinks his way down the right and stands one up in the middle, but Pope is onto him and claims before anyone in white can bundle home. 89 min: Calvert-Lewin has looked sharp and purposeful since coming on, putting himself about to some effect. Now he gets a stride ahead of Burn down the right, and fizzes a low drive towards the bottom-right corner. Pope sticks out a strong leg to hack clear. That was heading in. 88 min: Osula clumsily clanks Stach to the ground. A pointless challenge, because Newcastle were preparing to launch a counter attack. Guimaraes isn’t happy, and moans at the referee, which feels a little bit like displacement 101. 86 min: Bogle crosses from the right, looking for Calvert-Lewin, who prepares to direct a header goalwards from the penalty spot. But Schar is on point and heads behind for a corner instead. A necessary last-ditch challenge … and the resulting corner is a waste of everyone’s time. 85 min: Newcastle appear a little more eager to chase a winner, but Leeds are holding firm and there’s not a great deal happening. Speaking of which … “I’m not saying the game was wildly interesting before Jacob Murphy left the field of play,” begins Kári Tulinius, “but since his substitution, Newcastle’s attacks have been as forgettable as their away kit. Leeds have yet to do anything of note. Murphy might as well have gone home with the ball.” 83 min: Harrison scoops another pass along the inside-left channel. This one’s intended for Aaronson, in a pocket of space, but it’s way too strongly hit and sails through to the keeper. 82 min: Newcastle ping it around to little effect. “Harvey Barnes had scored a goal in five of his six Premier League games against Leeds before tonight,” writes Michael Jenkins. “As a Leeds fan I wasn’t unhappy that Howe decided to start Osula and Murphy ahead of Barnes. Not crazy about him coming on late with the score at 0-0 though.” 80 min: Gudmundsson picks up a knock and is replaced by Justin, freshly signed from Leicester City. 78 min: Guimaraes and Elanga nearly open Leeds up with a middle-distance one-two down the right. Nearly, but Elanga’s pass back is inches off target as Guimaraes enters the box. Had that found its target, Gumnaraes was in space, and one on one with Perri. 76 min: Livramento throws long from the right. Burn’s the target, but the throw doesn’t beat the first man. Leeds dealing with these long hurls rather better than Liverpool did on Monday night. 74 min: Calvert-Lewin, his tail up, now bashes a long-distance shot wide right. 73 min: Harrison intercepts a loose Tonali pass and strides down the left. Newcastle are light at the back. Harrison loops a pass down the channel for Calvert-Lewin, who strides ahead of Schar and tries to bring the ball down with a telescopic leg. He half-controls, but the heavy touch goes through to Pope. So nearly a fine combination between the former Everton duo. 71 min: Newcastle go up the other end and Hall sends a rising screamer over the bar. That wasn’t too far away from the top-left corner, and it’s not certain that Perri was getting there. 70 min: Space momentarily opens up for Gudmundsson down the left. He attempts to cross but Elanga blocks out for a corner. Before it can be taken, Calvert-Lewin comes on for his Premier League debut for Leeds, replacing Nmecha. Then the corner’s taken, and Pope claims it easily enough. 69 min: Scrub that. Botman is replaced anyway, sacrificed for Barnes as Newcastle go from five at the back to four. Botman trudges off under his own steam. 68 min: Botman, who has had his problems with injury, is thankfully good to continue. 67 min: Botman lands awkwardly after an aerial battle with Nmecha. On comes the trainer. 66 min: For a second, it looks as though Osula’s about to tear clear of Struijk … but he’s shoved the defender in the back with both hands. Nope! 65 min: Stach has the chance to release Aaronson into acres down the right, but seriously overhits the pass. Aaronson tries his best to athletically bring the ball under control anyway, but he can’t do so and the opportunity goes by. A smattering of irritated jabbering from the home fans. 63 min: Elanga crosses low from the right. Osula goes over in the vague environs of Rodon, but it’s not a penalty. “Watching Tino Livramento constantly ignore Dan Burn’s overlapping runs is borderline life affirming watching this at 4am,” writes Australia’s number-one Toon fan Chris Paraskevas. “Same goes for every corner that doesn’t clear the first man. We are the worst set piece team in the country.” 62 min: Newcastle make a couple of positive changes of their own, replacing Trippier with Hall and Murphy with Elanga. 60 min: Nmecha’s sheer presence down the right forces Botman into the concession of a corner … which is easily plucked from the sky by Pope. This match has not been an attacking masterclass. 59 min: Trippier sends it in. Guimaraes clatters into the nearest Leeds defender and that’s the free kick wasted. Leeds then make their first changes, sending on Aaronson and Harrison for James and Gnonto. 58 min: Livramento is flipped into the air by Bogle. Free kick, out on the Newcastle left. Trippier prepares to swing it into a packed Leeds box. 57 min: Trippier sends a not particularly good cross in from the right. Struijk considers heading behind for a corner, then pulls out, surprising Perri behind him. The keeper does well to make a reaction stop in double-quick time. Leeds finally clear their lines. Fiasco avoided in the nick of time. 55 min: … is headed clear powerfully by Nmecha. 54 min: This is better, though, as Murphy skips in from the right and buys a ticket for the raffle. He pearls a low swerving shot towards the bottom left, forcing Perri to turn the ball around the post. Fine play all round. Then the resulting corner … 53 min: Tonali and Schar take turns to consider shooting from distance. Neither do. Then Miley slices a simple right-wing cross into the stand behind the goal. It’s all a bit like that at the moment. 51 min: Gnonto scampers down the left and rolls across the face of the Newcastle box for Bogle, who is given a little too much time to line up his shot. Thankfully for Newcastle, Bogle is swinging with his weaker peg and sends the ball sailing high and wide. 49 min: Trippier goes lunging after a loose ball, and catches Nmecha. It’s clumsy rather than naughty, but it’ll hurt all the same. Nmecha gets up again soon enough. The referee not minded to flash yellow if he can avoid doing so, as the Longstaff-Ramsey challenge has already illustrated. 47 min: Newcastle kicked off in the PSG style, incidentally, punting long towards the corner flag. Get hip to the new craze, daddio. Newcastle get the second half started. They’ve been forced into a change: Ramsey is still apparently feeling the effects of that Longstaff challenge on 21 mins, and has been replaced by Miley. Speaking of strikers and transfers … here’s a bit of breaking news to while away the half-time break. Half-chances for both sides, but no cutting edge for either. Just a couple of days until the transfer window shuts. 45 min +2: Nothing much happens in the first two, so let’s hear from Toon fan Chris Paraskevas: “With the amount of delicious 90s-era whipped crosses going in - and Osula doing his best Mark Viduka At Newcastle impersonation, one second behind play every time the ball is delivered - I reckon just chuck Nick Pope up top and let’s see how bad his first touch really is.” 45 min: Newcastle are finishing the half strongly. Schar has a go from the right flank this time, but his long-range whip is always sailing high and wide. There will be four additional first-half minutes. 43 min: Murphy drifts in from the right and has a shot. Blocked. Corner. The set piece is worked long, and Schar, to the left of the D, nearly nets with a looping, dipping, speculative shot that almost drifts into the top-right corner. Had it been on target, Perri was beaten. But it deflects out for another corner, from which nothing comes. 41 min: Newcastle get patient, painting some triangles up and down the right channel, before suddenly pinging Ramsey into space on the flank. Ramsey looks long for Murphy, who can’t Van Basten a volley from an extremely tight angle on the left. Goal kick. 39 min: … nothing occurs. Newcastle attempt to counter but Gnonto stops Osula mid-gallop, and goes into the book. 38 min: Gnonto dribbles in from the left and takes a whack from the edge of the box. The shot deflects off Schar and out for a corner. From which … 36 min: Pope races from his box to clear the ball out for a throw, then deliberately gets in the way of James, stopping the Leeds man taking a quick one, and allowing him to get back into position. Into the book he goes. 35 min: Gudmundsson is sent into space down the left. He sends a dangerous diagonal ball through the six-yard box. Pope is out of position, but James and Bogle get in each other’s way at the far stick. Goal kick. Leeds are making awfully hard work of getting a shot away. 33 min: Gnonto cuts in from the left and has a chance to shoot, but opts against it, before losing possession. Longstaff wins the ball back just outside the Newcastle box, and tees up Stach, who curls well wide of the left-hand post. 31 min: Bogle romps down the middle and has the opportunity to release Gnonto into the box down the left. But he hangs onto the ball too long, and is eventually dispossessed by Tonali. Had he pinged Gnonto into space, the winger had just one man to beat, with other options in the middle. 29 min: Both teams suffering a bit from a lack of cutting edge up front. Like that’s breaking news. Penny for the thoughts of Newcastle’s new signing Nick Woltemade, who is watching in the stands. 27 min: James tries to release Nmecha down the middle. Nmecha can’t get the ball under control, and falls over in the environs of Botman. The crowd cry for a penalty, but the players don’t bother. 26 min: Livramento nips down the left touchline with dainty feet, and should pull back upon reaching the byline, but takes one touch too many and is ushered out of play by Bogle. 25 min: Murphy crosses low from the right but can’t find Osula in the middle. Both teams are nearly getting there. Meanwhile here’s more from James Humphries, who is definitely still not drinking on the train, officer: “To be fair, one of football’s little joys is watching a ref/assistant trying not to look like they’re dying inside as they stand on a touchline getting mocked by thousands, having their bum-bag battery adjusted and fiddling with their ear like they’re wondering if that second pass with the cotton bud was a terrible error. (I’d say ‘who’d be a ref, eh’ to close the circle but no, not quite able to take the broad view yet.)” 23 min: … nothing occurs, as Newcastle pull it back for Trippier, whose delivery from deep is no good. Leeds counter through Gnonto down the right. Gnonto crosses low, but Nmecha can’t quite extend his toes far enough to poke home at the near post. Pope gathers. 22 min: Guimaraes drops deep and nearly releases Osula down the middle with a raking ball. A little bit too much power on the pass. But Newcastle come again, through Murphy, who wins a corner down the right. From which … 21 min: … and it stops again as Ramsey gets a spot of treatment, having been caught from behind by an over-eager Longstaff. That could have been a booking. Thankfully Ramsey is good to continue, and so, having stopped again, we start again. Again. 19 min: James cuts in from the right and curls a dangerous-looking low cross into the Newcastle box. Botman dives to clear with a brilliant defensive header. Had he not intervened, Gnonto was meeting that cross, six yards out. A good game now, if a bit stop-and-start. 18 min: The rain continues to tip down. Summer’s gone, kids. Calling captain autumn. 16 min: Ramsey scampers down the left and fires a low ball into the box for Osula, who spins on the spot and fires a drive towards the bottom right. Gudmundsson makes a brave block. That was heading in otherwise. Leeds hack the ball behind, then deal with the resulting corner. So close to the opener. 14 min: The assistant has sourced some new batteries for his earpiece and the game can restart. Is the simple act of shouting at each other not the done thing any more? 12 min: Play is temporarily suspended because one of the referee’s assistants is having trouble with his headset. Good grief. 10 min: Murphy dribbles down the inside-right channel but eventually loses the ball, then gives Osula the what-for, presumably for not making a run and thus failing to give him an option to pass. 8 min: James dribbles in from the right and is caught from behind by Livramento, who is certainly putting himself about during these early exchanges. A free kick and so everyone lines up on the edge of the Newcastle box. With everyone expecting Stach to swing the ball in, he tries to catch Pope out with a low drive towards the bottom-right corner. There’s a gap there, but the shot sails harmlessly wide right. Think Gary McAllister in the final minute of the Merseyside derby at Goodison in 2001, only the other way around, and not as successful. 7 min: James combines with Stach as Leeds launch their first sortie down the middle, but Schar gets in the road to close the avenue to goal. 6 min: Other than that one burst from Livramento, this match hasn’t got going yet. Not sure whether James Humphries will care or not: “On my way back to Glasgow having watched Motherwell chuck a lead away again in the comedy/poundshop Pep style (ably assisted by the ref, but it’s a game in the SPFL so of course it was) against a team coached by one of our ex-managers, so I’m in a sufficiently foul mood that my hope for Dirty Leeds vs Dirty Money Newcastle is that they both somehow lose. A guy on the platform was handing out tins, though (which in case any of the transport polis are reading, I am definitely not drinking on the train) so maybe by the time we get home I’ll be wishing goodwill to both these fine historic teams. Maybe. Who’d be a football fan, eh?” 4 min: Livramento wriggles clear of Bogle and Rodon down the left, and into acres of space. He can’t find Murphy in the middle with his low cross, and Leeds get away with a big one. That was a fine run by the England full-back. 2 min: A fairly nondescript start to the game, during which Leeds see plenty of the ball. Elland Road in good voice. Leeds get the ball rolling. The rain tipping down in West Yorkshire. Before kick-off, there’s a moment of applause to remember all the Leeds fans who have passed away during the last 12 months. A beautifully warm ovation. The teams are out! Leeds in white with blue trim that takes us back to the late seventies, Newcastle in third-choice blue that takes us back to the late nineties (19th or 20th century, the choice is yours). We’ll be off after a couple of minutes of this piccolo-infused classic. Daniel Farke talks to Sky and is asked about his two full debutants, Sean Longstaff and Lukas Nmecha. “We have a tough start … away at Arsenal and then you play against Newcastle who were in their last game against 11 men the better side … we know it’s a tough fixture … at Elland Road we always have a chance … we want to use that today … intensity alone won’t be enough … quality on the ball … a good structure off it … Newcastle are one of the most intense sides … one of the toughest tasks … we expect a difficult game … but we will play to our own strengths … for [former Newcastle midfielder Sean Longstaff] it’s a pretty emotional game but also a chance to shine … we need him at his best … [striker Lukas Nmecha’s] physicality against a pretty physical defence is a good choice … hopefully they can both deliver.” Howe also clears up any confusion over today’s selection of Fabian Schär, whose substitution against Liverpool was erroneously reported at the time to be a result of concussion. “No it wasn’t [concussion] … he was actually fine … we made the decision to take him off because we couldn’t risk going down to nine men … there was a little bit of confusion but the doctor followed all the Premier League protocols and he was fine.” Newcastle finally landed a striker this morning, in the shape of 6ft 5in Nick Woltemade, and Eddie Howe is delighted, telling Sky Sports: “He’s got a presence, that’s for sure! … it was great to meet him in person yesterday … what a warm, great guy … friendly … he’s going to add a lot to our changing room … also add a lot on the pitch … real technical skills … hopefully he can score a lot of goals for us … I’ve got no idea on [how this signing affects the Alexander Isak] situation … I’m totally separate from it … I’m working on preparation for today.” Leeds United make two changes to the side that started the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal this time last week. Joël Piroe and Ao Tanaka make way for Sean Longstaff and Lukas Nmecha, both of whom are making their full debuts. Newcastle United make four changes to the XI selected to start that rollercoaster 3-2 loss against Liverpool. Sven Botman, William Osula, Jacob Murphy and full-debutant Jacob Ramsey come in for the injured Joelinton, the suspended Anthony Gordon, and Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga, who both drop to the bench. Sandro Tonali has recovered from the shoulder problem he suffered on Monday evening. Leeds United: Lucas Perri, Bogle, Rodon, Struijk, Gudmundsson, Nmecha, Gruev, Stach, James, Longstaff, Gnonto. Subs: Darlow, Calvert-Lewin, Piroe, Aaronson, Bijol, Okafor, Harrison, Bornauw, Justin. Newcastle United: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Guimaraes, Tonali, Ramsey, Livramento, Osula, Jacob Murphy. Subs: Ramsdale, Hall, Lascelles, Barnes, Thiaw, Krafth, Elanga, Willock, Miley. Referee: Peter Bankes (Merseyside). Both of these teams are hurting right now. And here’s why. An opportunity to salve the sting presents itself at 5.30pm UK time. It’s on!

5) Federal judge allows 9/11 case against Saudi Arabia to proceed to trial — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     A federal judge in New York rejected Saudi Arabia’s latest effort to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges the country supported the 9/11 hijackers, in what family members of victims described as a “powerful step toward justice”. Judge George B Daniels said that the claims in the lawsuit, brought by the families of those murdered, were legally sufficient to proceed to trial. He noted that the employment of an imam and an accountant by Saudi Arabia likely had some connection with the pair’s support of two al-Qaida members who came to the United States in early 2000 to study English and take flight lessons. He said the plaintiffs had provided “reasonable evidence as to the roles” that two Saudi men, Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia allegedly played, Axios reported. The case alleges that Saudi Arabian government agents provided “an essential support network” for the hijackers. In his ruling, Daniels wrote that Bayoumi “seemed to serve as a connecting point between the hijackers and many other people who had provided assistance to the hijackers at one point or another”, the New York Times reported. Lawyers for relatives of 9/11 victims claim that a group of extremist religious leaders in Saudi Arabia aided the 9/11 hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001. Terry Strada, national chair of 9/11 Families United, a group made up of family members of those murdered in the terrorist attacks, said in a statement: “Today’s decision is another powerful step toward justice. For nearly a quarter-century, the 9/11 families have sought accountability for the support and resources that helped make the attacks possible. Judge Daniels’ ruling makes clear that Saudi Arabia cannot escape responsibility through procedural maneuvers. We are prepared to move forward and present the full scope of evidence in court, so that the truth is undeniable and justice is finally delivered.” Strada added: “Justice demands more than promises. It requires transparency from our own government, accountability from those who aided the hijackers, and action from Congress. Our community will not stop until every fact is brought to light and every path to justice is secured.” Last year a video, filmed in 1999, was released showing Bayoumi – identified by the FBI as a Saudi intelligence agent – filming locations in the center of Washington three months before al-Qaida decided to carry out the 9/11 attacks. The video, obtained and published by CBS, includes commentary from Bayoumi about various locations in the city, including the Washington Monument and the entry points and security arrangements of the US Capitol building, and referring at one point to a “plan”.

6) Coco Gauff settles serve and nerves to book Osaka clash in US Open last 16 — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Coco Gauff arrived in New York with more questions than answers after reshuffling her coaching team on the eve of the year’s final grand slam. Her second major at Roland Garros in June had given way to a summer-long revolt of her serve, often marked by spates of double faults and premature exits, including a first-round departure from Wimbledon. She has framed the change as a long-term fix rather than a quick repair, saying she did not want to “waste time playing a way I don’t want to play”. After two tense night sessions to launch her US Open campaign, the 21-year-old American finally looked settled on Saturday morning, advancing to the second week of her home major for the fourth year running with a 6-3, 6-1 dismissal of Poland’s Magdalena Frech. To address her serving woes, Gauff has enlisted Gavin MacMillan, the biomechanics specialist who helped Aryna Sabalenka rein in her serving yips and climb to the world No 1 ranking with three major titles. The first two rounds showed the transition was bumpy for the No 3 seed: a three-set struggle against Ajla Tomljanovic, then tears on court in a fraught win over Donna Vekic. “It’s been an emotional week,” Gauff said. “I think I needed those tough moments to be able to move forward. I was putting so much pressure on myself.” This time there was no unraveling. Under bright sunshine rather than the Ashe floodlights before a robust Labor Day weekend crowd, Gauff struck just four double faults, built a 3-0 lead and, when Frech briefly levelled at 3-all, responded with assurance. Serving at 40-30 in a tense seventh game, she steadied with a 105mph delivery that drew an error, clenched her fist and surged through the rest of the set. The second set was more straightforward. A bruising 20-shot exchange went Gauff’s way to earn the first break, while another break at love followed two games later as Frech’s errors mounted. The Pole, seeded at a major for the first time, could not hurt the American once rallies extended. “She gives you no pace, maybe not too many angles to work with, so you kind of have to create all the opportunity for yourself,” Gauff said afterwards. Her delivery, so fragile in recent months, became a source of confidence. She landed nearly 80% of first serves in the opener and conceded only two points on serve during the second set. Even when a fourth double fault appeared as she tried to close, she brushed away the danger with a crisp volley before sealing victory after 73 minutes with a quiet pump of her left fist. “Today I definitely think was a step in the right direction,” she said. “I’m more proud of the mental effort … remembering the things that we worked on in practice.” The contrast with her opening rounds was stark. Instead of tense body language and second-guessing, she attacked from the baseline and looked to finish points at the net. The serve remains a work in progress, particularly the toss, but the rhythm was smoother and her self-belief clearer. She even suggested Thursday’s tears might have served a purpose: “Maybe it’s not a weakness,” she reflected. “It’s just showing the things that happen in my head … Today I felt a lot lighter going on court.” For Frech, the world No 28, this was still a week of progress. She had never previously reached the US Open’s third round and her win over Peyton Stearns ensured a career-best result here. But against Gauff the gulf in experience told. The American, making her 25th appearance in a grand slam main draw, already owns two major titles – and boasts a 30-1 record at the majors over the past two years against opponents ranked outside the top 20. That precocity places her among rare company. Only Venus Williams has reached more second weeks at grand slams among US women before turning 22. “This is the level I want to play,” Gauff said. “I know the competition gets tougher from here, but if I keep building from today, I like where my game is going.” Gauff now advances to a delicious fourth-round clash on Monday with Naomi Osaka, the two-time US Open champion who beat 15th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the second week of a major for the first time since 2021. It will be their sixth meeting – Gauff leads 3-2 in the head-to-head – and their first in New York since Osaka’s straight-sets win in 2019, when she was world No 1 and Gauff a 15-year-old wildcard. “It would be a cool kind of déjà vu, but hopefully with a different result,” Gauff said. “I remember it was a tough moment because it was such a hyped-up match. Looking back, I put way too much pressure on myself, thinking I had a chance to do something. I probably did, but I felt more expectation than belief.”

Fulham was done over by VAR. Bin it.” Scottish Premiership fixtures Motherwell 0-1 Kilmarnock Livingston 0-0 Hearts James Humphries has messaged in to say: “Big day in north Lanarkshire - Killie come to fir park under our ex-manager* Kettlewell, who quit citing fan abuse. I must confess I never heard anything beyond the usual for managerial abuse, but that is a pretty ridiculous standard to begin with, so it will be... interesting to see what sort of welcome he gets. “Anyway, with the well going pretty, uh, nicely under Askou’s possession-based football, and Kettlewell’s Killie below us only alphabetically, this could be pretty tasty; especially considering Kettlewell is fairly combustible type (I think he had three touchline bans last season, and that was only up to about February). Lots to look forward to then, and we’ll see how cheery I am after we’ve lost to the inevitable injury-time sickener.” Premier League fixtures Chelsea 2-0 Fulham FT Wolves v Everton Tottenham v Bournemouth Manchester United v Burnley Sunderland v Brentford Leeds United v Newcastle (5:30pm) Goals from Joao Pedro and Enzo Fernandez helped Chelsea to a 2-0 win over Fulham at Stamford Bridge.

Is he injured? They need goals.” To be completely honest, my guess is as good as yours! I don’t think he’s injured. At least, nothing has been said about any kind of injury. He should be fully match fit considering he had a full pre-season with RB Leipzig before moving to Manchester. I’d have thought this would have been the perfect game to put him in from the start. Like you say, United need goals! Jørgen Strand Larsen is not in the Wolves squad this afternoon amid rumours of a potential move to Newcastle. The Magpies saw two bids for the striker knocked back before finally signing Nick Woltemade, a move which was confirmed earlier today. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira said yesterday that Strand Larsen was being treated for a minor knock. Andre Onana has been dropped by Ruben Amorim for Manchester United’s match against Burnley this afternoon. The goalkeeper was heavily criticised for his performance against Grimsby on Wednesday. However, Amorim refused to point the blame at him. Sunderland starting lineup: Roefs, Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Mandava, Diarra, Xhaka, Sadiki, Talbi, Mayenda, Le Fee. Brentford starting lineup: Kelleher, Kayode, Collins, Van den Berg, Lewis-Potter, Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Ouattara, Damsgaard, Schade, Thiago. Wolves starting lineup: Sa, Bueno, Agbadou, Gomes, Tchatchoua, Andre, Gomes, Bueno, Munetsi, Hwang, Arias.

Burnley starting lineup: Dubravka, Walker, Ekdal, Esteve, Hartman, Ugochukwu, Cullen, Bruun Larsen, Mejbri, Anthony, Foster. Hello, good afternoon and welcome to another Clockwatch. We have four Premier League fixtures to look forward to this afternoon, with the likes of Manchester United and Tottenham in action. Following their shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town midweek, United host Burnley at Old Trafford in what could be viewed by some as a must-win game. Speaking of Grimsby, they face Bristol Rovers in League Two at the same time. Meanwhile, Tottenham welcome Bournemouth to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as they look to continue their perfect start to the campaign. Elsewhere, Wolves - who are yet to win a Premier League match this season - take on Everton and Sunderland host Brentford. I’ll also bring you updates from across the EFL as the 3pm BST matches get under way.

8) Manchester United squeeze past Burnley with controversial Fernandes penalty — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/30/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report
   Text:
     It is easy to see why Ruben Amorim has developed a love-hate relationship with his players after a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty controversially earned Manchester United’s first win of the season. The result should not have been in doubt but poor finishing and defending meant the hosts had to rely on the referee, Sam Barrott, to visit the pitchside monitor and overturn his own decision. Josh Cullen’s own goal gave United a deserved lead they should have built on but Lyle Foster and Jaidon Anthony were twice allowed to equalise either side of Bryan Mbeumo scoring United’s second in 11 chaotic second-half minutes. The match was heading for a draw until it was belatedly judged that Anthony had pulled down Amad Diallo and the United captain did the rest to send Old Trafford wild, while Burnley fumed. But once again, as at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Amorim did not watch the penalty. Things should have been far easier for United. There was an early intensity here as the supporters inspired the players and vice versa. The aggression on and off the field was designed to intimidate Burnley, and it had the potential to work. United had all the possession in the initial stages and looked sharper in mind and foot than at Grimsby as they attempted to play through the visitors, creating numerous half chances without testing the goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. The former Manchester City captain Kyle Walker was the most unpopular man in the stadium. He was booed when his name was read out and every time he touched the ball. He tried to curry favour when a desperately poor clearance was blocked by Mason Mount, who collected the ball and drove towards the box, with Walker pulling at him. A foul was committed and looked like the only debate was whether the indiscretion happened inside or outside of the box. Barrott decided it was a penalty but the video assistant referee sent him to review the footage on the monitor and minutes after the original decision, the referee joined Walker in the bad books when he changed his call. If there were any fears of a divide at United, injustice is a good tool to unify everyone. Technology worked in their favour when the referee’s watch bleeped to say the ball had crossed the line after Casemiro’s header had struck the bar and bounced in off Cullen’s back before Dubravka could act. Even if the manner was fortuitous, the goal was thoroughly merited. Knowing how to control a game when ahead is an art they are yet to master, as the draw at Fulham showed. Burnley also realised they needed to move from a passive to progressive mindset and push forward. Hannibal Mejbri could have marked his return to Old Trafford with a goal but fired over from 10 yards. United resettled after Matheus Cunha was forced off injured and replaced by Joshua Zirkzee. A second goal should have arrived from a dynamic break in first-half stoppage time but Amad fluffed his lines from close range. After 55 minutes of positivity and with the thought of long-term optimism starting to creep in, it was flushed away when Jacob Bruun Larsen swung in a perfect cross for the unmarked Lyle Foster to jab home from close range to begin a manic period of the match. With Old Trafford stunned into silence, the mindset was that of fearing the worst. Direct play changed that when Diogo Dalot reached Zirkzee’s flick and pulled the ball back into Mbeumo’s path for his first home goal as a United player, home fans rediscovering their voices 90 seconds after going mute. Structure had been forgotten, producing a riotous tempo. While the celebrations for United’s second died down, Foster had a goal ruled out for offside but the hosts were fragile. Once again, a set piece in front of the Stretford End was United’s undoing. They failed to clear the ball, allowing Loum Tchaouna to fire a shot which Altay Bayindir parried straight to Anthony, who bundled home a third goal in nine minutes to conclude the immediate chaos – but there was more to come. Fitting with the helter-skelter nature of the game, Barrott gave nothing after Amad ended up on the turf inside the box. He ran to the referee, who eventually went to review the incident and decided Anthony had held on too long. Burnley were incensed but Fernandes shut out the noise before creating euphoria, as troubles are briefly forgotten and pressure is relieved until the Manchester derby in two weeks.

9) Here’s what to know about the court ruling striking down Trump’s tariffs — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/trump-tariffs-explainer
   Text:
     Donald Trump suffered the biggest defeat yet to his tariff policies on Friday, as a federal appeals court ruled he had overstepped his presidential powers when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country in the world. In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that while US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes. It means the ultimate ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, which were famously based on spurious economic science and rocked the global economy when he announced them in April, will probably be made by the US supreme court. Here’s what to know. Which tariffs did the court knock down? The decision centers on the tariffs Trump introduced on 2 April, on what he called “liberation day”. The tariffs set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners and so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he argued have unfairly treated the US. Lesotho, a country of 2.3 million people in southern Africa, was hit with a 50% tariff, while Trump also announced a tariff of 10% on a group of uninhabited islands populated by penguins. The ruling voided all those tariffs, with the judges finding the president’s measures “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”. They said the tariffs “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration used to pass them. Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, but Trump claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency. The court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.” Trump invoked the same law in February to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, claiming that the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the US border amounted to a national emergency, and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it. Are the tariffs gone now? No. The court largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York that ruled Trump’s tariffs were illegal. But Friday’s ruling tossed out a part of that ruling that would have struck down the tariffs immediately. The court said the ruling would not take effect until 14 October. That allows the Trump administration time to appeal to the majority-conservative US supreme court, which will have the ultimate say on whether Trump has the legal right, as president, to upend US trade policy. What does this mean for Trump’s trade agenda? The government has argued that if Trump’s tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it has collected, which would deliver a financial blow to the US treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159bn by July, more than double what it was at the same point last year. The justice department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean “financial ruin” for the United States. The ruling could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward. The president does have alternative laws for imposing import tariffs, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. In its decision in May, the trade court said that Trump has more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits. How has Trump responded He’s not happy. Trump spent Friday evening reposting dozens of social media posts that were critical of the court’s decision. In a post on his own social media site, Trump claimed, as he tends to do when judges rule against him, that the decision was made by a “highly partisan appeals court”. “If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote. He added: “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.” Trump claimed “tariffs are the best tool to help our workers”, despite their costs being typically borne by everyday Americans. The tariffs have triggered economic and political uncertainty across the world and stoked fears of rising inflation.

10) Women’s Rugby World Cup needs jeopardy to stay in Monday morning conversations | Andy Bull — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     After all these years of asking for more, it’s churlish to complain when the Women’s Rugby World Cup delivered so much in one weekend. England’s victory pulled in two-and-half million prime time viewers on the BBC, 85,000 fans turned out across the four grounds, including a record-breaking 42,000 crowd in Sunderland, five hat-tricks, four packed fan zones, free concerts, and all those fireworks. It had almost everything anyone could have wanted. Almost. The one thing missing was a tight finish. The closest of the eight games was settled by three tries and change. The success of the World Cup isn’t just going to be measured by what happens on the weekends, but in the days in between them. World Rugby wants people to be talking about this tournament when they go into work on Monday morning. And for that to happen it needs some jeopardy. There were 72 tries in eight matches altogether, but 66 of them were by the winning team. England scored 11, so did Australia and Canada. South Africa scored 10. New Zealand eight. Blowouts happen in the pool stages of every Rugby World Cup: there were a bunch of one-sided matches in the men’s tournament two years ago, when France beat Namibia 96-0, New Zealand scored 96 against Italy and Ireland defeated Romania 82-8. The difference this time was in what happened in between. The matches that we hoped would be close turned out anything but, with Scotland beating Wales 38-8 and France beating Italy 24-0. Which didn’t surprise anyone who regularly watches women’s rugby, but maybe requires some explaining to the huge new audience who are only just discovering it. “The numbers don’t always tell the full story,” said World Rugby’s director of women’s rugby, Sally Horrox, when she was asked about it this week. Horrox argues that 49% of women’s rugby fans have come to it in the past two years regardless of how uneven the standard. These scorelines don’t necessarily stop the games from being entertaining. And she’s right, the Red Roses’ victory was as good as a one-sided game gets. No one at the stadium felt it suffered from being so predictable. Like the competition director, Yvonne Nolan, said, there was a lot of “fast, free-flowing rugby”, and plenty to admire in the way the losing teams played. But it’s true, too, that no amount of fireworks or free concerts can disguise the gaps between some of these teams. Women’s rugby needs the enthusiastic support of the media as it grows; its lack of visibility is, World Rugby argues, the biggest obstacle to its success. So there are good reasons why a lot of what is written and said about the women’s game tends to gloss over the obvious imbalances between the teams. The irony is that it’s a sign a sport has matured that everyone involved is able to be honest about what everyone’s watching, instead of celebrating the simple fact that so many people are. To their credit, Horrox and Nolan are both too smart to pretend anything else. They don’t shy away from speaking about the lopsided results, which are inevitable given the uneven pace of development in women’s game around the world. “These teams,” as Nolan says, “are all at different stages of their journey.” Women’s rugby is growing so quickly that the gaps between the teams are actually wider now than they were during the first tournament, back in 1991 (when only one match ended with a 50-point margin) because a handful of sides, and England in particular, have raced so far ahead. This Saturday, a Red Roses side, who have the benefit of all the expert coaching, medical support and sport science the Rugby Football Union can provide and who, because the country has one of the two professional domestic leagues in the world, are paid to play and train seven days a week, take on Samoa, who don’t even have national contracts, and whose team include a full-time property manager, police officer and primary school teacher, who all had to rely on donations to cover the lost income they have suffered by missing work to compete in England. Which invites the question of which is the better achievement, an overwhelming victory for the professionals or an honourable defeat for the amateurs? If they’re honest, the Red Roses will know that given their pedigree and the resources at their disposal, they made too many basic mistakes even when they beat the USA by 62 points. And that, too, may be the result of the fact that they have had so few close matches in recent years that they have been able to get away with being sloppy. World Rugby is doing what it can to help narrow the gap. It has provided all the smaller teams with access to a pool of nine specialist coaches, who work across set pieces, skills, and strength and conditioning, Alain Rolland has been brought in to work with them on how to reduce their penalty counts. But they can’t cover everything. Even Canada, who are one of the strongest teams in this tournament, had to crowdfund the last $1m of the $3.2m they needed to compete. But in the long term, a lot of this will come down to the hard work of widespread structural change, the small steps forward in between the tournaments, as well as the great leaps made during them.

11) Rangers and Celtic fans united in anger going into derby after European disasters — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Never in the history of a derby stretching back to May 1888 and more than 400 matches has the backdrop been as bizarre as this. The yin-and-yang nature of football in Glasgow means supporters of Celtic must be happy because those following Rangers feel dismay, or vice versa. Very occasionally there is general contentment, as in recent times when Rangers could draw kudos from European progress to offset domestic disappointment. As the sides head for Ibrox on Sunday there is outrage. Widespread, collective outrage. In Russell Martin and Brendan Rodgers, we have managers who do not feel compatible with their clubs. Victory for either side in the first Old Firm clash of the season would douse dissenting voices only momentarily. Embarrassment came in different forms for Celtic and Rangers in Europe this week but it was embarrassment nonetheless. Followers of both clubs can be unrealistic in their analysis and demands. In the current context, they are quite right to voice disquiet. Celtic’s scenario is the more complex and bewildering. Rangers simply appear to have erred in the appointment of Martin. He had very little leeway with the Rangers support from the outset and the disorganised shambles that was the 6-0 loss to Club Brugge on Wednesday further inflamed opinion. Rangers were lucky to escape with that level of defeat. Much is said of Martin’s philosophy but a manager who cannot implement basic defensive principles can have no excuses. Rangers’ signing policy is wholly unconvincing. The case for Martin surviving surrounds Rangers’ American owners not being as susceptible to deafening mood music as others before them. The same custodians would also have to admit their first key hire was a disastrous one. There is nothing in Martin’s demeanour or output to suggest he can oversee what would be a remarkable change in fortune. This job looks as if it will swallow him up. “The noise is the loudest I have ever had to deal with as a coach or a player,” Martin admitted. “You have to accept that being here and I knew it would be the case. This job isn’t for the timid. It’s not my job to speculate on or worry about what people on the outside think.” Rodgers returned to Celtic in 2023 with progress in Europe in mind. Domestic dominance was virtually guaranteed. Progress to the knockout phase of last season’s Champions League – where Celtic were unlucky not to defeat Bayern Munich – boosted Celtic’s standing. Since then, there has been regression; key players sold, replacements not sourced. A club with supposedly risk-averse custodians – plus an estimated £100m in the bank – gambled on the biggest prize of all and lost after failing to score against Kairat Almaty over 210 minutes. Celtic will arguably antagonise angry supporters even further by signing players – none of whom should have been out of reach in June – post-Champions League exit. Rodgers has made his frustrations clear since pre-season, albeit he has gradually toned them down. He has refused to confirm that his club are aligned on transfer strategy. The curious thing is that the Irishman has been in this movie before, making agitation plain long before a move from Celtic to Leicester six years ago. On what basis did he return to Glasgow and what change in approach did he expect? Champions League qualifying rounds have tripped Celtic up seven times since 2014 (in two subsequent seasons they did not play in them). On Friday Rodgers stressed harmony within Celtic and talked of a board that “bleeds for the club”. He said: “It is not about investment. This club will invest. The club is super-well run. What we need to look at is the timing of investment.” Failings are collective. Rodgers is far from blameless. Celtic even in diminished form had enough to see off Kairat. The manager’s transfer dealings from last summer – when Arne Engels, Paulo Bernardo, Auston Trusty and Adam Idah arrived for close to £30m – have not affected the starting team to anything like an acceptable extent. Presumably Tony Bloom did not anticipate opportunity arriving so early after the purchase of a 30% stake in Hearts – and the Edinburgh club are not yet positioned to seize upon it anyway – but muddled decisions in Glasgow are proving that the English billionaire may just have backed the right horse again. Supporters of other Scottish clubs will mock, as is their right. Week to week, the Old Firm lord it over those with a fraction of their resources. Yet big-picture terms are hardly appealing. Losses for Aberdeen and Hibernian on Thursday placed further dents in an unimpressive European coefficient. Some chickens are coming home to roost, including in respect of the national team, for a Scottish Premiership that places next to no emphasis on youth development. All focus at Ibrox will be on relieving tensions. Just do not expect that to be the case for long beyond 90 inevitably exhausting minutes.

12) Trump news at a glance: court ruling threatens to upend Trump’s tariffs; Kamala’s security detail revoked — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     A US federal appeals court has ruled that most of president Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal, describing the levies as “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”. The ruling, which will take effect on 14 October, is the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policy and will likely mean the supreme court will have to rule on whether Trump has the legal right as president to upend US trade policy. Reacting to the decision on social media, the president said: “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” If allowed to stand, the ruling would “literally destroy the United States of America”, he added. The president on Friday also revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 election rival Kamala Harris after it was extended by Joe Biden before he left office. The move has been slammed by some as “another act of revenge”. Here are the key stories: Most of Trump’s tariffs are illegal, federal court rules Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-rattling tariff policies, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled on Friday. US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”, the court said. Many of Trump’s steep tariffs “are unbounded in scope, amount and duration”, the ruling added, and “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration has leaned on. Read the full story Trump revokes Kamala Harris’s Secret Service detail extended by Biden Donald Trump has revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris.

After the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis this week where two children were killed and 17 others injured, Kennedy suggested that psychiatric drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun violence across the country. This week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify “mitochondrial challenges” in children at airports just by looking at them.

The teenager, a US citizen with disabilities, was in a vehicle with his mother outside Arleta high school in Los Angeles on 11 August when masked immigration agents surrounded them and pulled them from the vehicle. They said the boy was a suspect in a crime and handcuffed him for several minutes until they realized they had the wrong person, the Los Angeles Times reported.

13) Police warn protesters not to travel to Epping after asylum hotel ruling – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     The Home Office won its appeal against the closure of the Bell hotel in Epping for asylum seekers. This means asylum seekers will stay in the lodgings in Essex past 12 September. In its successful appeal, the Home Office argued removing the men could damage the asylum accommodation system but the government said it still plans to stop using the hotels by the end of this parliament. The council could still be granted another injunction at the full hearing in mid-October. Epping Forest District council has said “this is not the end of the matter” and they will “continue to fight”. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch responded to the court decision by saying Keir Starmer “puts the rights of illegal immigrants above British people”, while shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said there is “no acceptable accommodation for illegal migrants”. In nearby Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a video posted on YouTube showed dozens of demonstrators behind barriers near the Delta Marriott hotel, which has also been used to house asylum seekers. Essex police said it was putting a section 60AA order in place in Epping, which gives police the power to ask anyone to remove an item such as a mask that is being used to conceal identity. The order will be in place for 24 hours, the force said. In a post on Facebook, Essex police said: “Throughout the evening, we have monitored a protest in Cheshunt and we now believe a group of people present there are planning to travel to Epping. A number of people involved in that group have been seen wearing facemasks and balaclavas.” Deputy PM Angela Rayner should face an ethics inquiry over her tax affairs, the Conservatives said. The Telegraph newspaper claimed Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, saved £40,000 in stamp duty on a second home she bought in Hove for £800,000. This was because she removed her name from the deed to a family property in Greater Manchester, the newspaper reported. However, Rayner also previously suggested the Greater Manchester home remained her primary residence, according to the Telegraph, saving some £2,000 in council tax on her grace and favour home in central London at Admiralty House. The Conservatives have referred Rayner to the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests as a result of the conflicting reports. The Tories have also written to Tameside council, the authority that covers her Greater Manchester home, asking the authority to strike her from the electoral register if the property is no longer her primary residence. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said Rayner “has followed advice on the allocation of her official residence at all times”. A statement provided by the deputy prime minister’s team to the Telegraph said: “The deputy prime minister paid the relevant duty owing on the purchase of the Hove property in line with relevant requirements and entirely properly. “Any suggestion otherwise is entirely without basis.” Essex police said it was putting a section 60AA order in place in Epping, which gives police the power to ask anyone to remove an item such as a mask that is being used to conceal identity. The order will be in place for 24 hours, the force said. In a post on Facebook, Essex police said: “Throughout the evening, we have monitored a protest in Cheshunt and we now believe a group of people present there are planning to travel to Epping. “A number of people involved in that group have been seen wearing facemasks and balaclavas.” Assistant chief constable Glen Pavelin said: “We will always seek to facilitate peaceful protest, for all groups. “But the threat of antisocial behaviour and criminality by people attempting to conceal their identity steps outside of the reasonableness of protest, and we have a duty to protect our community. “My officers will be fair and engaging, but they will be firm in how they deal with anyone who is asked to remove a face covering and refuses. “Anyone who does not will face arrest.” In nearby Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a video posted on YouTube showed dozens of demonstrators behind barriers near the Delta Marriott hotel, which has also been used to house asylum seekers. Police stood in front of the barriers and some roads were closed with counter-protesters from Stand Up To Racism also in attendance. At one point, protesters appeared to clash with officers. Away from the ruling for a moment, suspended Labour MSP Colin Smyth has denied allegations that he placed a secret camera in toilets inside the Scottish Parliament. The Press Association understands that Smyth has been charged by the police in relation to the allegation, which was first reported in the Daily Record. The South Scotland MSP was arrested on 5 August and charged with a separate offence of possession of indecent images, prompting his suspension from Scottish Labour. His Holyrood pass was deactivated on Thursday. On Friday, Smyth said he was “fully co-operating” with the investigation but said the decision by the police to release further information and his home address had been “devastating”. He said: This allegation has come as an utter shock and one I strongly refute. For legal reasons, I can’t respond to specific matters or speculation, and I appreciate there is a process to go through which I am, of course, fully co-operating with. But I sincerely hope it can be concluded quickly and fairly. The speculation, and the recent decision by the police to publicly release details of their ongoing inquiries along with my home address has been devastating and has taken a serious toll on my health. After my address was published with no warning to my family, I felt I had no choice but to move away to protect them. That has also meant losing the local NHS critical support I had been receiving for the past few weeks, making an already difficult time even more distressing. I would therefore ask that the privacy of myself, but above all my family and friends, is respected while this matter is resolved. Having this hanging over them is especially overwhelming. Responding to the ruling, Steve Smith, chief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais, told the BBC it “made it clear that violent protest, and in many cases overt racism, is not a fast-track route for the far right to attack the rights of people seeking sanctuary in this country”. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Lisa Smart, told the broadcaster that Labour should be “speeding up asylum processing to bring down the backlog and end hotel use once and for all”. And border security and asylum minister Dame Angela Eagle said the government “will stop using hotels, which aren’t a sustainable solution, by the end of this parliament”. “This judgement assists us by allowing us to do that in a planned and orderly fashion,” she said. “We all want the same thing,” she added, “which is to get out of asylum hotels”. Protesters were already gathering outside the Bell hotel by Friday evening with St George and union flags waving. This court ruling was never going to end as a quiet legal moment. For the Home Office, the court of appeal’s decision was a practical win. If the ruling had gone the other way the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils. Since there is scant alternative accommodation available, this ruling buys the government time. Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year. If the closures proceed, the ruling means they still have time to deliver their promise of shutting all the hotels down “in a controlled and orderly way” by 2029. But political tensions have, of course, been reignited. Nigel Farage immediately jumped on the moment, accusing the government of “using the law against the people of Epping”. He said “illegal migrants now have more rights than the people of Essex” and promised Reform UK would “put an end to this”. This is the kind of high-emotion, high-visibility moment Farage thrives on and a story that plays into his hands. Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, also piled in, telling supporters on X: “Judges side with illegal migrants against British people. ECHR used by judges to overrule planning law, democratic protests and the safety of Epping residents.” The government remains stuck in the same political fight – trying to stave off challenges from the right while at the same time getting on with the job of ensuring there is a functioning political project that can communicate its wins. Angela Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said: “Nobody wants to close the Bell hotel and all other asylum hotels more than me.” She reiterated the government’s pledge to do this by 2029. Asked what her message is for those who say the fight’s not over, she responded: “I think we all want the same thing – which is to get out of asylum hotels.” Eagle added: “We’ve said they’re not sustainable and we’ve inherited a system with huge backlogs,” the BBC reported. A temporary injunction that would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, has been overturned by the court of appeal. Here we explain what the court decided, and its significance, writes Haroon Siddique and Aletha Adu. What was the appeal about? Last week, after an application by Epping Forest district council (EFDC), a high court judge ruled that asylum seekers could no longer be placed at the protest-hit Bell hotel and gave its owner, Somani Hotels, until 12 September to rehouse the 138 remaining there. Mr Justice Eyre granted the injunction, to remain in force until the case could be heard in full in October, after hearing EFDC’s complaints that planning law had been breached in changing the site’s use. Somani Hotels challenged the decision at the court of appeal, as did the Home Office, which had been refused permission by Eyre to intervene in the high court case. What did the court of appeal decide and why? The three justices said both Somani Hotels and the Home Office, which it permitted to intervene in the case, could appeal against Eyre’s decision and quashed the temporary injunction in the meantime. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said Eyre had made a number of errors in principle. He said: “The judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system.” A protester outside the Bell Hotel in Epping said the Court of Appeal ruling was “devastating” and could “cause civil unrest”. Carmen, who wore a pink top that said “Pink Ladies Say, The Only Way is Epping, Send Them Home” on it, said she was “very let down” by the ruling. Speaking outside the Bell Hotel, the Epping resident told the PA news agency: “We come every week – march, protest – and today’s ruling is just devastating, absolutely devastating. It will probably cause civil unrest. “It’s shocking, it’s like they’ve won. The schools go back next week – the kids will be walking around the back, it’s not good.” Asked why she was protesting outside the hotel, Carmen said: “To show our support – get them out. “We’re not racist, and I’m all for things done legally, but these are unvetted 18-30s, maybe some plus. “We don’t know who they are, we don’t know what they’ve done, but now they’re letting us know what they’re like.” An Epping councillor said the Court of Appeal ruling was “hurtful” and claims children are “frightened to go to school” in the town. Shane Yerrell, who represents Waltham Abbey West for Epping Forest District Council, said he was “disgusted” by the Court of Appeal’s ruling. Speaking outside the Bell Hotel, Yerrell told the PA news agency: “All the local parents felt like there was one big step forward when the High Court agreed to close the hotel and things started to calm down. “But then for the Home Office and the Government to both appeal and that be accepted today is hurtful.” In a further statement following the Court of Appeal ruling, Epping Forest District Council said it was “ruling nothing out”, including taking its bid for a temporary injunction to the Supreme Court. It said: “We do not accept the criticisms of the council which has acted only in the interests of the people of Epping Forest. We are reviewing our position – we are ruling nothing out until we have examined all the options up to and including the Supreme Court. “Epping Forest District Council has responded to criticism related to earlier use of the Bell Hotel despite this not being relevant to the current legal action. “The circumstances of the placement in 2023 were very different to those in 2025. In reality the complexity of some planning applications mean that they take much longer than the statutory eight weeks to determine.” The council added: “In any case it would not have affected the outcome of the application. At any time after the eight-week period, the hotel operator could have appealed against non-determination. “In the event, the Home Office ceased the use of the Bell as asylum seeker accommodation and it became an academic point. “To have continued once the use had ceased would seem to have been a waste of taxpayers’ money, especially as we had no reason to believe the Bell would be stood up again.” Shadow home secretary Chris Philp claimed the Epping hotel case had “seen the Labour government using the courts against the British public”. He said: The government even brazenly said in court that the rights of illegal immigrants were more important than the rights of local people. The numbers in asylum hotels were dropping fast before the election – but have risen since because Labour has lost control of our borders. We need a proper deterrent so that all illegal immigrants are immediately removed on arrival. Then no one would bother crossing in the first place. We had a plan to do this – the Rwanda plan – but Labour scrapped it just before it was due to start. As a result, numbers crossing the channel are now the worst ever. We have a full-blown border crisis and public-safety crisis – but this government is too weak to take the action needed to fix it. The full written ruling overturning the temporary injunction which would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel will be handed down remotely on Monday at 4pm, according to court listings. Before reading a summary of their judgment on Friday, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said their full judgment, running to more than 120 paragraphs, would be handed down later. The leader of Epping Forest District Council in Essex has questioned whether Bell Hotel owners Somani Hotels “chased” its planning application. In a summary of their ruling, Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb highlighted that in February 2023 Somani had sought planning permission from the council to temporarily change the hotel’s use to accommodate asylum seekers rather than paying members of the public, but that the council “did not process the application” for more than a year. Asked why the application had taken so long to process, councillor Christopher Whitbread said he was “not close enough to the detail” to give a “full answer”. He added: “I think, you know, you have to ask yourself ‘was the company chasing the planning application during that time?’ “In my knowledge of planning applications, if they’ve been delayed, that the company going for the planning application will be chasing the council. “Did they chase the council? We don’t know.” The government has “let the residents of Epping down”, the leader of Epping Forest District Council said. Asked what his message would be to people who may be planning to protest this weekend in the Essex town, Councillor Christopher Whitbread told the PA news agency: “We don’t want to see some violent scenes around the hotel or in the town itself that would that would only help the Government’s arguments, and it’s the Government that have let the residents of Epping down. “I had numerous conversations with various people around this issue, the Home Office were not helpful.” He said housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel was “not right” for residents of Epping or those living in the hotel itself, adding: “We made that argument to the previous government and eventually they closed it. “This Government reopened it in April with no real consultation with us, they instructed us that they were going to use it. “We were instructed on the numbers and such that they were prepared to use it up to, and really they have let down completely the residents of Epping Forest, and I think what underlined it was their legal argument yesterday around the ECHR and the fact that the asylum seekers trump the residents of Epping when it comes to their rights.” In reaction to today’s verdict, Weyman Bennett, Stand Up to Racism co-convenor said: “The initial judgement was always wrong. It was a concession to racist thugs set on scapegoating and intimidating refugees.” Kevin Courtney, Stand Up To Racism co-chair, said: “This court judgement is welcome, hateful demonstrations should not determine public policy. “The far right will seek to use it to stimulate more and more hostile demonstrations targeting asylum seeker in hotels. It’s important that all people of goodwill speak out and peacefully mobilise against this hateful targeting of vulnerable people.” Protesters have begun to gather outside the Bell Hotel in Epping after the Court of Appeal ruling. A small number of demonstrators carrying England and Union flags have gathered outside the hotel, with police officers guarding its entrance – which is gated off with metal fencing. An England flag has been attached to a drain pipe on the side of the Bell Hotel and England flags have also been painted onto signs and a speed camera outside the hotel. Three appeal judges on Friday set aside a temporary injunction granted to Epping Forest district council last week, saying the decision to allow it was “seriously flawed” and contained several “errors in principle”. The hotel has in recent weeks become the focus of repeated protests – some of which have been orchestrated by far-right extremists and have turned violent. Epping council had offered this as part of its grounds for seeking the injunction – alongside concerns about planning permission for the hotel. Last week, Mr Justice Eyre, sitting in the high court, agreed. But, on Friday, the court of appeal judges said upholding that order could lead to further disorder by effectively demonstrating it could achieve its ultimate goal – the removal of the asylum seekers one way or another. They said the people living at the Bell hotel would have to be housed somewhere, while other councils could take preserving the injunction as a green light to seek the same in their areas. In a summary of their ruling, Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb said that Somani Hotels, which owns the Bell hotel, was first made aware of legal action being taken by Epping Forest district council when it “received the court papers and a court bundle running to over 1,600 pages”. The judges said the authority’s “tactics” were “procedurally unfair” and “ought to have reinforced the argument” that a temporary injunction should not have been issued. They said: For much of the period of four years from 2020-2024, Somani [Hotels] had been running the hotel as accommodation for asylum seekers without enforcement action from the council. When, in 2023, Somani [Hotels] sought planning consent to change its use, for over a year, Epping did not process the application, notwithstanding the statutory duty upon it to do so within eight weeks. The council was aware by February 2025 that the hotel was once again to be used to house asylum seekers and by its letter of 15 May 2025, Somani [Hotels] made clear that it had been advised by the Home Office that a planning application was unnecessary. The council took no steps in response to this letter, whether by issuing an enforcement notice or otherwise. There was no threat of court proceedings. Epping Forest district council will “continue to fight” the government after the court of appeal ruling, a councillor has said. Holly Whitbread said the ruling was “deeply disappointing”, adding she felt “utterly let down and betrayed by the government”. Whitbread, who is finance and economic development portfolio holder for Epping Forest district council, told the PA news agency: The council will continue to fight this We’re looking at our legal options now and we will be going ahead, I presume, with the permanent injunction in the October trial, if that’s still possible. The Conservative councillor added: The council has always been against the use of this hotel in this location. One of the key points that wasn’t made clear in the court case was the change to all-male asylum seekers within the hotel. I’m pretty furious at the government’s action to intervene in what was a legal planning matter. And I think this news will be deeply disappointing to the residents of Epping Forest and, more broadly, across the UK as well. In a summary of their ruling overturning the injunction related to the Bell hotel, Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb said an argument put forward by the Home Office in the appeal about a “hierarchy of rights” was “unattractive”. The Home Office had told the court of appeal in written submissions for Thursday’s hearing that while Epping Forest district council represented “the public interest that subsists in planning control in its local area”, the department represented the “public interest of the entirety of the United Kingdom”. Barristers for the government told the court that the European convention on human rights “establishes non-derogable fundamental human rights”, adding: The respective legal rights in play are fundamentally different in nature. In a summary of their ruling, the three court of appeal judges said: The written arguments on behalf of [the Home Office] in this appeal included the contention that ‘the relevant public interests in play are not equal’ and that one aspect of this is that the home secretary’s statutory duty is a manifestation of the UK’s obligations under article 3 of the European convention on human rights. This point was not pursued in oral argument. Any argument in this particular context about a hierarchy of rights is in our view unattractive. The summary continued: We were told by counsel for Epping [Forest district council] that the protests operated as a ‘trigger’ for the application for the injunction. The fact of protests outside a building is not obviously a matter falling within planning control. While we accept that the judge was right to exercise considerable caution before attaching weight to the fact of the protests, including unlawful protests outside the hotel, he nonetheless gave weight in his evaluation to the fact that protests were occurring and weighed them in the balance as a factor in favour of granting the injunction. These are worrying aspects of the judgment. If an outbreak of protests enhances the case for a planning injunction, this runs the risk of acting as an impetus or incentive for further protests, some of which may be disorderly, around asylum accommodation. At its worst, if even unlawful protests are to be treated as relevant, there is a risk of encouraging further lawlessness. The judge does not appear to have considered this risk, again perhaps because he had denied himself the advantage of hearing submissions on the merits from counsel for the [Home Office]. Further and in any event, in this regard the judge failed to consider whether there would have been alternative measures to mitigate the disruption, such as the use of police powers. Nigel Farage claimed the European convention on human rights had been “used” by the government “against the people of Epping”, though the judge ruled that arguments about a “hierarchy of rights” were “unattractive”. The Reform UK leader said: The government has used ECHR against the people of Epping. Illegal migrants have more rights than the British people under Starmer. He did not specify which part of the case he was referring to. The Home Office’s lawyers had argued “the relevant public interests in play are not equal”, referring to Epping’s interest in enforcing planning control on the one hand, and the home secretary’s duty which comes from UK obligations under the ECHR on the other. However, Friday’s ruling says: Any argument in this particular context about a hierarchy of rights is in our view unattractive. For more on this topic, read BBC News home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani’s take on the ruling (see 3.29pm BST). The leader of Epping Forest district council has called for calm after the court of appeal ruled asylum seekers can stay at the Bell hotel in Essex. Councillor Chris Whitbread told Times Radio: I call for calm. There’s been peaceful protests and there’s been non peaceful protests outside the hotel. He added: We saw yesterday the government say that asylum seekers have more rights than my residents. I’m really cross with this ruling. Obviously we’ll now reflect on where we are. Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful, but we will do everything we can still. This is an awful position for the town … I’m really concerned for the future of the town at the moment. Speaking outside the London court after the ruling, Ken Williamson, member of cabinet for Epping Forest district council said: We understand government faces a dilemma, but that should not be at the expense of local communities. Planning law may seem dull, it might seem boring, but it goes to the heart of the relationship between local communities and good government. It enshrines the rights of local people to have a say within their own communities, and it should not be set aside lightly. The government can still listen. It needs to understand and take responsibility for the events that have taken place in Epping over the past six weeks, for the trauma and disruption brought upon our community. The council could still be granted an injunction after a full hearing of the legal claim, which is due to be heard in October. Reacting to the overturning of the injunction, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said while the government was successful in its appeal, the reality of using hotels to house asylum seekers is “untenable”. He said: Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an option. As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and persecution feeling unsafe. Through our frontline work we see how refugees housed in neighbourhoods, rather than isolated in hotels, are able to rebuild their lives, enter training or work, and contribute to the local economy. The refugee charity urged ministers to adopt a “one off” scheme granting temporary permission to stay to asylum seekers from countries most likely to be recognised as refugees as a way to close hotels by next year, according to its own analysis. Speaking on BBC News, the broadcaster’s home and legal correspondent, Dominic Casciani, said from outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the judgment: To use an analogy from sport, it felt like a wrestling smackdown for the judge who gave this injunction to the council. This is quite a technical thing because in essence the lower court, the high court, the judge there had the discretion to say: ‘Look, I’ve looked at all the facts and using my discretion, which is why I think an injunction is necessary because the facts on the ground are such that we’ve got a really concerning situation. We’ve got to contain what’s going on there, therefore I think it’s in the best interest to move the asylum seekers out for the time being before Epping Forest district council gets to mount its full case against the hotel owner, which will then ultimately decide the issue one way or another.’ What the court of appeal said today was: ‘No, you got that completley wrong. And the reason you got that completely wrong is because you failed to take into account that there are compelling arguments that the home secretary has to be allowed to make, because she is under a legal duty, imposed by parliament.’ [And] this is the important thing, it’s imposed by parliament, it’s got nothing to do with the European court of human rights or all that stuff you might read elsewhere, this is a duty imposed by parliament to make sure that asylum seekers aren’t sleeping on the streets. So, every day that the home secretary is not finding somewhere to put somebody in a bed, she’s facing potential legal action over that failure to do so. And what the court of appeal said was that the judge who issued the injuction should have taken all of this in to account before issuing his orders to clear the hotel, because how could he otherwise have understood the implications for national policy and effectively what is known as the wider public interest. … the strength of the argument from the court of appeal … in essence, the practical effects of that are that I think this makes it exceptionally hard for any other council to try and do what Epping Forest [council] have done. The Home Office has issued a ministerial statement regarding today’s court of appeal judgment on the use of the Bell hotel. Angela Eagle, minister for border security and asylum said: We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day. The number of hotels has almost halved since its peak in 2023 and we have brought down costs by 15% saving £700m and putting us on track to save a billion pounds a year by 2028-29. We are also working hard to relieve pressure on the system and striking back at criminal people smuggling gangs at every stage, including returning more than 35,000 people who have no right to be here, equipping law enforcement with counter-terror style powers and starting to detain small boat arrivals under our groundbreaking deal with France. It will take some time to fix the broken system we inherited, but the British public deserve nothing less, and we will not stop until the job is done. Senior Tory Robert Jenrick called the court of appeal ruling “extremely disappointing” and urged councils to still take action to close asylum hotels in their areas. Shadow justice secretary Jenrick posted on X: This is an extremely disappointing decision. Yvette Cooper used taxpayer money – your money – to keep open a hotel housing illegal migrants. The government’s lawyers argued accommodating illegal migrants was in the ‘national interest’. In court they said the right of illegal migrants to free hotels is more important than the rights of the British people. Well, they are not. The British government should always put the interests of the British people first. Starmer’s government has shown itself to be on the side of illegal migrants who have broken into our county. But this is not a free pass for asylum hotels. Councils can and should still act to close hotels. If they don’t, residents will rightly ask, on whose side are they? My team and LawForBorders will continue to provide legal assistance to help protect communities. There is no acceptable accommodation for illegal migrants. The government should be prioritising Brits in need and deporting every illegal migrant, as the last government should have done and I’ve argued for years. Senior Conservative James Cleverly suggested that the Home Office was cutting local people out of the loop. The shadow local government secretary said: I’m sure that Yvette Cooper and the Home Office officials think this is good news. It really isn’t. Cutting local people and their elected representatives out of the loop isn’t a good look. After the court of appeal’s ruling, Lisa Foster of Richard Buxton Solicitors, which represents Somani Hotels, said: We are pleased that the court of appeal has ruled that the injunction should not have been granted by the high court. Our clients realise that they have been caught in the middle of a much wider debate on the treatment of asylum seekers and respectfully ask that members of the public understand that the Bell hotel has simply been providing a contracted service that the government requires. We now ask that all associated with the Bell hotel are left alone to continue to support the government’s asylum plans as best they can. We are grateful to the court of appeal for appreciating the urgency of the matter from everyone’s point of view and dealing with the matter so swiftly. We have no further comment and will not be commenting on the matter again. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed Keir Starmer “puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities”. She urged Conservative councillors seeking similar injunctions to “KEEP GOING!” despite the ruling. In a statement, Badenoch said: Local communities should not pay the price for Labour’s total failure on illegal immigration. Keir Starmer has shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities. This ruling is a setback, but it is not the end. I say to Conservative councils seeking similar injunctions against asylum hotels – KEEP GOING! Every case has different circumstances, and I know good Conservative councils will keep fighting for residents, so we will keep working with them every step of the way. She said the party will be writing to all Tory councillors with further advice after the judgment. Badenoch added: Labour have run out of options, so the only answer left is to dump the problem on local communities. Reading the summary, Lord Justice Bean said: The Epping residents’ fear of crime was properly taken into account by the judge as a factor in favour of grant of an injunction. He described it as being of limited weight. He added: We agree it is relevant, but in our view, it is clearly outweighed … by the undesirability of incentivising protests, by the desirability in the interests of justice of preserving status quo for the relatively brief period leading up to the forthcoming trial and by the range of public interest factors which we have discussed in our judgment. A temporary injunction that would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, has been overturned at the court of appeal. Quashing the injunction, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said: We grant permission to appeal, both to Somani and to [the Home Office]. He continued: We allow the appeals and we set aside the injunction imposed on 19 August 2025. Giving a summary of their ruling, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said: We conclude that the judge made a number of errors in principle, which undermine this decision. He continued: The judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system. He added that such an injunction “may incentivise” other councils to take similar steps as Epping Forest district council. He said: The potential cumulative impact of such ad-hoc applications was a material consideration … that was not considered by the judge. Three senior judges have ruled that the Home Office can intervene in the case related to a temporary injunction concerning the Bell hotel in Epping. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said that Mr Justice Eyre made an “erroneous” decision not to let the department be involved. Reading a summary of their decision, Bean said the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public safety” and was affected by the issues. Reading a summary of the ruling, Lord Justice Bean said: We should say at the outset what this appeal is not about. It is not concerned with the merits of government policy in relation to the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers in hotels or otherwise. Lord Justice Bean is reading a summary of the panel’s judgment. He’s just outlined the two linked applications for permission to appeal, one from the Home Office and home secretary and the other by Somani Hotels, which owns the Bell hotel. He has also spoken about how many asylum seekers the hotel houses and Epping Forest district council’s (EFDC) argument that Somani Hotel’s actions are in breach of planning law. Three senior judges have begun giving their judgment on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is set to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, is reading a summary of their decision at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. We’re expecting the judgment from the court of appeal shortly on whether to overturn a temporary injunction to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. In the meantime, here’s the Guardian’s report on the hearing that took place yesterday: The government failed to analyse the costs involved in the largest reorganisation of English councils in decades, BBC News reports. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner claimed that merging councils in 21 areas into single authorities could save “a significant amount of money.” But cost estimates from Rayner’s housing department were based on a 2020 report commissioned by the County Councils Network (CCN), which projected potential savings of £2.9bn over a five-years period. Since then, the CCN has updated its findings and now suggests that the reorganisation might not lead to any savings and could, in some cases, result in higher costs. Tim Oliver, chairman of the CCN, said reorganisation could still deliver “billions in efficiency savings to be reinvested in frontline services,” but only if implemented at the right scale. Oliver added: We are concerned over the potential costs of reorganisation where proposals seek to replace the two-tier system with multiple small unitary councils. In the current two-tier system, responsibilities are shared between county councils and district councils. Local councils involved in the restructuring have been submitting proposals to form new single-tier authorities. David Lammy was given more than £32,000 worth of luxury gifts from the crown prince of Kuwait after visiting the country last month but is not keeping the offerings due to UK government rules, PA reports. The foreign secretary received a Chopard watch and pen set worth £11,002, a Cartier pen worth £435, FRED jewellery worth £18,250 and perfume worth £2,500 by Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah, newly released data shows. All the gifts, given in July, will be held by the Foreign Office. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has not kept a special edition whisky he was given by Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort, which was above the value limit for gifts that can be accepted by members of government without being declared. A book and a tie he received from French president Emmanuel Macron, and a leather wallet received by Victoria Starmer from Brigitte Macron, have also been held by No 10 rather than purchased. Ministers can keep gifts worth up to £140 and do not have to declare them but if the gift is of higher value, they can choose to pay the difference between the value and £140 to buy it, or to leave it with their department. Meanwhile, the Green party in England and Wales has confirmed it will announce the result of its leadership election on Tuesday (2 September). Two weeks ago, we reported that Zack Polanski, the insurgent candidate whose “eco-populism” and social media savvy have upended the race, had started to pull away from his more-established rivals. There is a growing expectation that the election will be won by the 42-year-old former Liberal Democrat, who appears to have seized the initiative from his opponents. One likened it to a “hostile takeover”. The comment relates to an apparent influx of new left-leaning members in local areas, attracted by his modern communications method and more pugnacious style. It has left his nearest opponents, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, struggling to gain traction despite their head start in terms of profile within the party. The full timetable for its internal elections can be viewed here. The new leaders of the Scottish Greens, Ross Greer and Gillian Mackay, have promised to campaign for a universal income, free bus travel and higher taxation on the rich after winning a muted election contest. Greer and Mackay, who were both backbench MSPs at Holyrood, were appointed co-conveners of the Scottish Greens after a noticeably low turnout of 12.7% – only 950 of the party’s 7,500 members voted after a low-key summer campaign. They admitted the turnout was worrying. Greer said he had long believed the party had lost its energy and significant changes to its structures, internal elections and campaign apparatus were needed. “We’ve allowed ourselves to become a radical bureaucracy rather than a radical democracy,” he said. “And we need to see serious internal reform. We need to reform as a party if we are to grow as a party.” Mackay denied it was embarrassing. “I think it is a concern. And I think that’s why we do need to find out why [turnout was so low],” she said. The leadership contest took on added significance as it was called after Patrick Harvie, who had been the UK’s longest-serving party leader, announced earlier this year he was standing down after 17 years in the post due to ill health. Scott McDonald, the chief executive of the British Council, has written an opinion piece for the Guardian: On Wednesday night, our office in Kyiv was damaged in a Russian missile attack. It was a stark reminder of the risks that an organisation such as ours faces in conflict-affected areas. I was relieved to hear that all colleagues were safe and accounted for. One colleague was injured and admitted to hospital but thankfully he is in a stable condition. Working under such conditions around the world is challenging, and yet, time and again, our colleagues and partners demonstrate courage and commitment in carrying on despite the dangers. Their resilience is extraordinary. We are working to find ways to minimise disruption and continuing to support our team there. Persistent air alerts mean some of our colleagues are required to remain in shelters, but sadly this is nothing new. The war has taken an enormous toll on the Ukrainian population, including a deterioration in quality of life, severe psychological and emotional challenges, and the disruption of social connections and education. But the unyielding spirit of the people is always evident. Take, for instance, a British Council event that took place in September last year, when we set up a pop-up event in Lviv in partnership with Molodvizh, the city’s largest youth event. Tragically, during a missile attack a few hours before the event, a representative of a partner organisation was killed, along with her family. This greatly affected everyone, but it was felt by all the partners that it was important the event should continue. Despite these perilous circumstances, British Council colleagues and partner organisations continue our work with education, teaching, English language learning and cultural programmes right across Ukraine, as we have done for the past 30 years. When a country is at war the protection of its culture is ever more important, and the British Council is a key partner in supporting Ukraine. You can read the full piece here: For the first time, a free chickenpox vaccination will be offered to children in England by the NHS from January next year. My colleagues, Nicola Davis and Jamie Grierson explore the background to the rollout in this explainer: Three senior judges will rule on whether to overturn a temporary injunction to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, at 2pm on Friday. The Home Office and Somani Hotels, which owns the site, are attempting to challenge a high court judge’s decision last week to issue an interim injunction to Epping Forest district council that will stop dozens of asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel beyond 12 September. The government is also seeking to appeal against Justice Eyre’s decision not to allow it to intervene in the case, while the council opposes the appeal bids, the PA news agency reports. At the end of a hearing on Thursday, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said that they would hand down their judgment on Friday afternoon. He said: Because of the great urgency of this matter, we will aim to give judgment at 2pm tomorrow. If it proves impractical for us to meet the deadline, we will let people know in advance. Speaking after the Scottish Green party leader election results were announced in Edinburgh on Friday, newly elected co-leader Gillian Mackay said “today marks a generational shift in the leadership of the Scottish Greens”. She vowed she and Ross Greer – also a newly elected co-leader – will “lead with courage and listen with intent”, putting party members “at the heart of our movement”. Greer said he is “excited to be embarking on this journey as co-leader” with his “friend” Mackay, reports the PA news agency. Mackay won 34% of first preference votes, and was elected at stage one of the ballot. Greer gained 31% of first preference votes, ahead of Lorna Slater on 28% and Dominic Ashmole, who polled 7%. Greer was elected at the third stage of the ballot, with 33.4% of votes, ahead of Slater, who had 32%. Greer said after the results were announced: Gillian and I have known each other for a long time, we have spent a long time talking about what we would do if we were ever in charge of this party. Now we get to stress-test all of those theories about what a Scottish Green party led by us would actually look like. He insisted the Scottish Greens are “the only genuinely progressive party left in this country” in the run-up to next May’s Holyrood election. He claimed the SNP is “dropping progressive policies all over the place”, while Labour is “aping every Nigel Farage press release”. Greer said the Greens are “brave enough to take on the rich and powerful”, and he told party members: Now is the time for us to do difficult things. We know our party can do better, can be better. We need to continue on that journey of improvement, we need to get better with our messaging, better with our campaigns. We need to make it fun. We are trying to transform Scotland for the better, that should be a joyful experience for everyone who wants to get involved in. Mackay meanwhile said Green policies, such as free bus travel for under-22s and the introduction of buffer zones around abortion clinics – legislation she herself successfully brought forward at Holyrood – mean the party has “already started improving the lives of millions”. But she insisted: “We can and will go further.” Mackay, who had her first baby over the summer recess, said she will “champion a four-day week, better parental pay and basic universal income” – adding these are “policies that will transform lives”. Both new co-leaders praised their predecessors, with Mackay saying: I want to thank Patrick for the work he has done for the party in the past 17 years. I have never known a Scottish Greens without him at the helm, and I certainly think it is going to be an adjustment for us all. Greer said: Patrick has defined our party in the eyes of the Scottish public for almost two decades, he has led us through periods of incredible growth and achievement. He thanked Patrick Harvie for “transforming this party from a well-meaning, enthusiastic fringe outfit into a force capable of delivering the transformation people and planet really need here in Scotland”. He also thanked Slater for “six years of incredible service as co-leader of our party”. Government silence and a light news agenda has created the conditions for a seemingly well-funded Nigel Farage barrage, writes the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot. You can read her analysis on Farage season and how, with its rivals away, Reform has been basking in summer headlines: Bunting has been removed by a council from across a road due to concerns that a high-sided vehicle could drive into it and pull down the poles holding it up, reports the PA news agency. Durham county council has issued a statement about the recent increase in the number of union flags and Saint George’s cross displays on lamp-posts. The Reform-led council said that while it understood and respected people’s desire to display national pride, public safety should not be compromised. It will take a “risk-based approach” and it will remove flags where they pose a danger to road users, obstruct visibility for drivers or pedestrians, or if they are poorly secured. The statement published on Friday continued: Yesterday we were left with no choice but to remove bunting across a road at New Brancepeth, following a risk assessment. The rope involved was so strong that, had a high-sided vehicle driven into it, the poles it was attached to could have been pulled down. Our approach reflects our commitment to balancing community expression with public safety, practical resource management, and proportionality in our operations. According to the PA news agency, the council also warned the public of the risk of attaching flags to lighting columns, saying that leaning ladders against them “imposes additional loads beyond their designed capacity”. The council said: The weight of a person climbing or working on a column can lead to structural failure, endangering both the installer and the public. UK bank shares tumbled on Friday, cutting the stock market value of the sector by almost £8bn in morning trading, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the autumn budget spooked investors. Calls for a tax grab, in a paper written by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank, took a toll on some of the UK’s biggest high street banks. NatWest Group suffered the biggest drop on Friday morning, registering a decline of as much as 5% in its share price, while Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays followed close behind, falling 4.5% and 3.6% respectively. HSBC dropped more than 1%. The falls cut the notional value of the UK’s biggest banks by £7.9bn within hours of the market opening. It comes as rumours swirl over a number of potential tax increases – including on banks, property and landlords’ rental income – which could help the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, plug a shortfall of up to £40bn in the public finances. The IPPR’s report calls for a new tax on the big banks that would help to recover “windfalls” enjoyed by lenders as a result of an emergency economic policy known as quantitative easing, which was put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Confidence among UK businesses has grown despite anxiety about the state of the economy, in a rare slice of positive news for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to her autumn budget. An August poll of UK companies by Lloyds Bank showed that improved sentiment among manufacturers and retailers helped push overall optimism within UK plc up by two percentage points, with 54% of companies now feeling confident in the current environment. It marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase in overall business sentiment, according to the Lloyds business barometer, driven by a growing number of businesses – roughly 63% – feeling strong about their own trading prospects. On that measurement alone, confidence reached its highest level since 2014. About half of all businesses now expect to hire more staff in the coming year despite growing costs. The survey found 38% of companies are expecting to have to raise wages by 3% or more, with the vast majority – 83% – saying that higher employment-related costs would have a limited impact on hiring plans. Overall optimism across the private sector comes despite jitters over the state of the economy, with levels of positive sentiment falling for the first time since the drop seen in April, when Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements sparked fears over the future of global trade. Economic confidence fell three points to 44% this month, Lloyds said, although that remained above the longer-term average of 19%. However, the fact that business confidence continues to rise amid the economic gloom will be a rare piece of good news for the chancellor, given fears that a fresh round of tax increases – meant to bolster the public finances – could knock confidence and investment across the private sector as companies try to recoup and offset costs. Reeves is expected to announce a date for her autumn budget within days. Scottish Greens have elected a new co-leadership team, with MSPs Gillian Mackay and Ross Greer voted in to take the party forward. The pair replace Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, both of whom had served as junior ministers in the Scottish government under a powersharing deal with the SNP. Harvie announced earlier this year he was standing down from his co-leadership post. Slater had stood for re-election, but was defeated in the leadership contest, which is held every two years under Scottish Green party rules. The UK government has banned Israeli officials from attending the country’s flagship defence event next month. Israeli industry, including UK subsidiaries of Israeli companies will be able to attend London’s Defence &amp; Security Equipment International (DSEI) show in September but the UK government will not invite representatives of the Israeli government to the major industry event. The move comes as Keir Starmer prepares to recognise a Palestinian state after warning Israel it would do so if the country did not take steps to relieve suffering in Gaza and met other conditions. A UK government spokesperson said: The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong. As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025. There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion as it has done previously at the DSEI. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael, IAI and Uvision, will be able to attend. Conspiracy theorists who spread misinformation must be defeated, a health minister said, as he urged parents to take up the new chickenpox jab. The government has announced a new vaccination programme for chickenpox from January, meaning that GPs will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – the clinical term for chickenpox – as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule. Health minister Stephen Kinnock argued it is “common sense” for parents to vaccinate their children, amid what he described as a rise in “vaccine hesitancy” after the Covid pandemic. Speaking to LBC, Kinnock said: There’s been a 10-year trend in declining take-up of vaccines, and I think obviously the vaccine hesitancy that came after the pandemic has definitely not helped. These conspiracy theorists, who are peddling this nonsense and rubbish, we’ve got to take them on, we’ve got to defeat them in our arguments and drown out the noise that they’re making. The government is working with GPs, schools and public health authorities to create local and national campaigns in an attempt to increase take-up, Kinnock said. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: Most parents probably consider chickenpox to be a common and mild illness, but for some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal. It is excellent news, that from next January, we will be introducing a vaccine to protect against chickenpox into the NHS routine childhood vaccination programme – helping prevent what is for most a nasty illness and for those who develop severe symptoms, it could be a life saver. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, chickenpox causes an estimated £24m in lost income and productivity every year in the UK, with parents forced to take time off work to care for their children. The rollout of the vaccine is also expected to save the NHS £15m a year in costs for treating the illness. Kinnock said: We’re giving parents the power to protect their children from chickenpox and its serious complications, while keeping them in nursery or the classroom where they belong and preventing parents from scrambling for childcare or having to miss work. This vaccine puts children’s health first and gives working families the support they deserve. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the jab on the NHS in November 2023. Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, said: This is a hugely positive moment for families as the NHS gets ready to roll out a vaccine to protect children against chickenpox for the first time, adding to the arsenal of other routine jabs that safeguard against serious illness. We will work with vaccination teams and GP surgeries across the country to roll out the combined MMRV vaccine in the new year, helping to keep children healthy and prevent sickness from these highly contagious viruses. The PA news agency reports that outsourcing company Mitie, which manages the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC), has responded to its earlier news story about the government instructing it to remove certain jobs at an immigration removal centre from a recruitment website (see 9.07am BST). A spokesperson for the company said: As part of our contractual obligations, we employ colleagues to run activities at Heathrow immigration removal centre to support the physical and mental wellbeing of detained individuals. The impact of these services was highlighted in the recent HMIP (HM Inspectorate of Prisons) report into Harmondsworth, which said that these provisions contributed to a greater overall focus on helping individuals to manage the stresses of detention. Last year, the watchdog said the conditions at Harmondsworth were the “worst” in the country, with the chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor describing the “chaos” he discovered there as “truly shocking”. The Scottish Greens will announce the result of its leadership election on Friday. Current co-leader Lorna Slater, MSPs Gillian Mackay and Ross Greer and activist Dominic Ashmole are seeking to form the new co-leadership team, with the result to be announced at an event in Edinburgh. Co-leader Patrick Harvie – who has been one of the party’s leaders since 2008 – announced earlier this year he would stand down from the role but continue to be an MSP. Among the policy pledges outlined by the candidates is universal free bus travel, which was proposed by Greer – who has widely been seen as a contender for the leadership since he was elected to Holyrood at the age of 21. Mackay – who shepherded landmark legislation placing buffer zones outside abortion clinics through Holyrood – said she believed she can “take the party further and deliver great election results”. Slater – one of the two only Green members in the UK to serve as a government minister as a result of the Bute House agreement – said the party went from “being a small but effective party to being a significant force in Scottish politics” as she pledged to go further to “build a fairer, more progressive and greener country”. Ashmole – who has stood for the party at numerous elections but does not hold elected office – said his pitch to members is to put climate change front and centre, urging Scots to “prepare for the worst, strive for the best – and protect what we love”. Whichever pair wins the final ballot, reports the PA news agency, the leadership team will probably be the ones to lead the party into the 2026 Holyrood election with a view to increasing their MSP cohort from the seven won in 2021. The government has instructed a contractor to remove certain jobs at an immigration removal centre from a recruitment website after advertisements for floristry and hairdressing tutors emerged, reports the PA agency. Outsourcing company Mitie, which manages the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC) near the west London airport, listed several roles online including a painting and decorating tutor and gym manager at the IRC for salaries that range between £31,000 and £38,000. One of the job descriptions includes responsibilities to deliver workshops in floristry, cake decorating, balloon-craft and arts and craft activities to “provide a safe, secure, stimulating, supportive and productive environment for residents”. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra said: We do not believe all these roles are necessary and have told the Home Office to speak to Mitie to remove them. The government department has not yet clarified which jobs Mitie has been directed to remove, and a number of roles remain listed on the government’s find-a-job portal, reports the PA news agency. On its website, Mitie said it aims to “treat those in our care with dignity, decency, and respect” and provide an environment for residents to “engage in activities relevant to them”. Health minister Stephen Kinnock said there had been “excessive interpretation” of contractual obligations. He told LBC: My understanding of it is, they’re contractually obliged to have some kind of physical exercise, because you want to make sure that people aren’t falling into ill health, because that just makes it even worse for the taxpayer if we’re having to deal with that kind of thing. But it seems that there’s been an excessive interpretation of those contractual obligations and Seema Malhotra, the immigration minister, I’m very pleased to say, has rapidly responded to this and instructed Mitie to delete those jobs, and that is a good move on her part. The Heathrow IRC combines Colnbrook and Harmondsworth removals centres and is, according to Mitie, the largest IRC in Europe with a capacity of 965 residents. The company has been approached by the PA news agency for comment. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax and urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued. In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as public finances are tight. “What started as a programme to boost the economy is now a massive drain on taxpayer money,” he said. “Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design. While families struggle with rising costs, the government is … [in effect] writing multibillion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.” The emergency policy, first enacted in 2009 during the global financial crisis, involved buying up £895bn of bonds from the UK’s banks and, in exchange, crediting them with reserves at the Bank of England. The Bank is now winding down QE – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – by selling the bonds at a rate of £100bn a year, but these sales are taking place at a loss. In accordance with a promise from Alistair Darling, then chancellor, the Treasury bears the financial risks of QE, so these losses hit the government’s finances. In addition, the higher Bank of England base rate, now set at 4% to combat above-target inflation, means the Bank is paying out higher interest rates on banks’ reserves than it is receiving on the bonds it holds. In total, these losses amount to a £22bn-a-year hit to the public finances, according to the IPPR. Jung calls for the Treasury to tax the big banks on their QE-related reserves, saying the profits of the big four have more than doubled since before the Covid pandemic. He says such a policy could bring in £8bn a year and sidestep the Bank’s objections to a widely mooted alternative known as “tiered reserves”, which the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has argued could interfere with its job of combating inflation. The immediate closure of asylum hotels could lead to migrants “living destitute in the streets”, a government minister said, as he warned against a “disorderly discharge”. Health minister Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: It’s not a question of if we close the hotels, it’s a question of when and how we close the hotels, and what we don’t want to have is a disorderly discharge from every hotel in the country, which would actually have far worse consequences than what we currently have, in terms of the impact that would have on asylum seekers potentially living destitute in the streets. And I don’t think any one of the communities that are campaigning on these hotels issue want to see that. So what we are doing is looking to appeal this injunction simply because we’re taking a pragmatic approach to how we want to manage the process, not because we believe that the hotel … per se should stay open.” Pressed on where the migrants would be moved to if the Bell hotel in Epping were to close, Kinnock said: We’ve got a whole range of options – disused warehouses, disused office blocks, disused military barracks. We are looking at every option that we have to manage the discharge, and it’s really important that we do that and put those plans in place, but of course, it’s going to be much more effective if we’re able to do that in a way where we’re controlling the discharge from these hotels. Later today, we should get the judgment from the three senior judges ruling on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel. It is expected at about 2pm. In other developments: The Foreign Office in London summoned Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, at 1pm, in direct response to the severe damage inflicted on the British Council building in Ukraine, government sources said. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the attacks as “senseless” and accused Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax and urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued. In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as public finances are tight. England needs to “wake up” to its faltering infant vaccination programme, experts have warned, as it was revealed that one in five children start primary school unprotected from serious infectious diseases. The government has urged parents to make sure their children are up to date with their vaccines. The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the country’s most senior chief constables has said. Serena Kennedy retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four years in charge. She criticised politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport riot. A member of the House of Lords asked a senior British diplomat to help a Ghanaian goldmining venture in which he held shares, claiming it was “in the UK national interest”, the Guardian can disclose. The revelation will add to concerns about apparent breaches of parliamentary lobbying rules by Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army. The peer is already under scrutiny over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases to investigations by the Lords’ standards body.

14) Amorim admits he sometimes ‘hates’ United players and some days ‘wants to quit’ — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Ruben Amorim admits his temperament means that on some days he “hates” his players and wants to quit and that on others he loves his squad and feels he would like to be Manchester United’s head coach for 20 years. Meanwhile, two of his forwards – Rasmus Højlund and Antony – neared the Old Trafford exit on Friday. Amorim offered the remarkable insight into his personality at the end of a week in which he stirred uncertainty over his future with comments made after his team lost at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. On Friday he said he intended to continue at United after the international break and thought he would do so but that he could not make any promises on his future. After the Grimsby game Amorim said “something has to change” and that “my players spoke really loud about what they want”. Asked about those remarks as he prepared for Saturday’s home game against Burnley, he expressed no regret. “Every time that we have in the future one defeat like that, I’m going to be like that,” he said. “I’m going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players. “This is my way of doing things and I’m going to be like that. In that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I’m not going to be like that.” Amorim believes United’s problems start in the players’ heads. “I feel the players are always thinking about the past,” he said. “They think there is something in the water here or in the food. It’s in our minds. We just need to think about the next game. We dropped a level [against Grimsby]. Now we have to respond in the next game.” After playing Burnley, United resume their season on 14 September at Manchester City. Amorim was asked whether he could confirm he would be in charge after the break. “I don’t know what is going to happen,” he said. “That is my idea. But again, I am not going to promise you anything – what is going to be the future. But I’m the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change.” The Portuguese said he understood how his post-Grimsby reaction had caused uncertainty regarding whether he would resign. “If you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that are good [from] that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin,” he said. “So I understand that. “And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years. Sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It’s going to be hard.” Asked whether anyone at the club tries to talk him out of moments when he feels the need to quit, Amorim said: “I just need 10 minutes with myself. I don’t need anyone.” After likening his extreme feelings for his players to those he has for his children, saying “sometimes I hate my kids”, he suggested improved results would make him less likely to “suffer”. “We just need to win some games and then things will be easier to do.” Amorim’s inflexible adherence to a 3-4-3 shape can draw criticism. He has said that formations do not matter so was asked, then, why he was unwilling to change. “If I feel it is best to change [I will],” he said. “We need to be so good in this way of playing and then we are going to adapt. When everyone is doing this with his eyes shut then we are going to do different things. This is the fun part.” United agreed a season-loan deal with Napoli for Højlund on Friday. The deal includes an obligation to buy worth €44m (£38m) if Napoli qualify for the Champions League. The player still needs to accept the move to the Serie A side and could stay in Manchester. The club also accepted a £25m bid for Antony from Real Betis, a huge loss on the Brazilian, who was signed on 1 September 2022 for £82m, though there is a 50% sell-on clause. As the Guardian reported this week, Kobbie Mainoo wishes to leave. But Amorim said he valued the midfielder. “I want Kobbie to stay,” he said. “He needs to fight for his place, and we need Kobbie. So that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing at this moment are disappointed. You have to fight during the week [in training].”

   Text:
     UNITED WE FALL The modern football manager might wear classic Reeboks, or knackered Converse, or trackie bottoms tucked in socks but, to continue paraphrasing the Arctic Monkeys song, there ain’t no romance in our game no more. Nothing endures. The average managerial tenure tends to last between 18 months and two years. For Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Besiktas, it was a little more than seven months; José Mourinho got 14 at Fenerbahce. And so the pair, intrinsically linked by their sequential spells at Manchester United, find themselves on similar paths again, their sackings from Turkish nearly-clubs coming within hours of each other this week. Both have been caught in the meat grinder of Uefa’s endless European qualifiers. Solskjær’s brave Besiktas boys were downed by Ineos-owned Lausanne in the Tin Pot playoffs on Thursday night. A day earlier, Mourinho’s men were ousted by Benfica in the Bigger Cup equivalent. It feels rather timely that these two former United bosses should be chucked through the door marked Do One just as the latest man to suffer the Old Trafford meme factory is put to his limits. Ruben Amorim will rue the day he popped into Sports Direct to buy that magnetic tactics board, for it was instantly imbibed into the internet’s collection of looped two-second videos for merciless and eternal social media use. Amorim, the sweet-talking dogmatist whose principled management was the exact reason for his appointment at United, is now being viewed with ridicule and derision, just as Solskjær and Mourinho were before him. It comes for everyone. Solskjær was a club legend who ended his reign by crying on MUTV; Mourinho was the managerial great living miserably in a hotel room after alienating his squad. The scythe’s swing is remorseless. The United fanbase has always been divided regarding how to view the aforementioned duo. Without question, they occupy the top two in the post-Ferguson cartel of managers, albeit Erik ten Hag and Louis van Gaal won domestic cups where Solskjær won none. But the Norwegian came second, produced fluent football and endeared himself to United supporters. The romanticists loved him, how he paid lip service to the club’s history by playing counterattacking football and refusing to use Sir Alex Ferguson’s old parking space. It is widely agreed that sacking Solskjær in November 2022 was a premature move by United, given they had no idea how to replace him. There are now even some whispers among supporters about bringing him back. You know the drill: an interim spell, 4-2-3-1 and good vibes. Isn’t that what football is about? Oh no, sorry, romance is dead … Instead United and Amorim plough on together. The dreaded vote of confidence. The rigid formation. Mason Mount at left wing-back. The apologies from Diogo Dalot after another defensive disasterclass. There are rumours Amorim may be considering walking away from it all, shunning a hefty payoff, believing there is a desert island somewhere for him to sit on and fiddle with his laminated tactics tablet forever more. As Solskjær and Mourinho prove, however, the most likely future awaiting Amorim is a bleak spell managing Trabzonspor, eventually getting the bullet in late August 2028 for a meek Big Vase qualifying defeat to Lens. Be warned, Ruben. QUOTE OF THE DAY I used this word unintentionally, just to make it very clear. I had no intention, there was no message, there was no hidden agenda. I fully understand it’s my responsibility that I created these headlines. I’m sorry for the upset and for the headlines that I created. I’m experienced enough, I should have known better and should have done better. I thought I have a little bit more credit with you guys, that I do all this in my second language.

My mate in Newcastle congratulated my team on knocking ‘the vile Mackems’ out of the Carabao Cup (but we were a mere two divisions below them so it won’t have registered with you guys and it is likely to be a league game next season anyway) and then went on to comment on his team losing at home to Liverpool. ‘Always disliked them, but it’s now visceral with all this Judas Isakariot business. T-shirts with his picture on are on sale outside the ground with a free box of matches” – Richard Askham. As the transfer window draws to a close, Zian Flemming’s permanent switch to Burnley for a reported £7m fee may not have caused the same headlines as Gyökeres or Eze, but let me tell you that Zian is worth his weight in gold! Quite literally, with Flemming reportedly weighing in at 84kg and gold prices hovering around $3,466 per Troy ounce, he would be worth £7m in gold. To use the old football idiom and question whether he is worth his weight in goals however is quite another matter … “ – Sam from London.

17) My favourite childhood outfit: ‘I am in classic British beachwear – a cardigan knitted by my nan’ — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     I inherited my hands from my nan. Long and slim with hard but feminine nails, we called them “piano fingers”, though neither of us ever learned to play. While I went on to use mine for writing, my maternal grandmother dedicated hers to knitting. Decades before the Sewing Bee or Tom Daley’s Instagram, Barbara would go to the local wool shop for designs and supplies – everything, right down to tiny buttons. As her first born granddaughters, my elder sister and I were the natural beneficiaries of this skill, willing mannequins covered in glitter glue and nostalgia. When I look back at photos of myself until around the age of six, I realise I’m usually in knitwear. This commitment to wool was not limited by season or location: in my early years, whenever I was photographed on a beach, I was wearing a cardigan as the waves splash at my feet, like an influencer promoting swimwear for people with hypothermia. Before my parents had a car, my mum, sister and I would regularly drive to the seaside with my grandparents while my dad was at work. In the summer of 1989, when I was four years old, we made the more than 200-mile journey to Bournemouth from Lincolnshire. There is one photo from the trip that I always remember. I am wearing a classic British beach outfit: shorts, a blouse, sunglasses, and, of course, a cardigan. Its thick, sky-blue knit fastened across my chest, the cardie is colour coordinated down to a packet of cheese and onion crisps. Surrounded by a striped windbreaker and a red bucket and spade, I am sitting on a foldable chair secured in the holes my grandpa made in the sand. At that point, I didn’t yet have a wheelchair and made do with an NHS-grade buggy; cumbersome and immobile on beaches (though I later learned wheelchairs were little better). The metal folding chair, with a generic cartoon figure on the back, regularly accompanied me on these trips. Blond pigtails and a nonchalant leg tilt, my eyes hidden by heart-shaped glasses, I have the air of a queen looking over her kingdom, dressed in her favourite robe. I didn’t know it at the time, but this would be the last summer before school, when the grinds of life would begin. A few weeks after this photo was taken, I would start reception class; the sand castles swapped for spellings. Over three decades later, I can’t help but envy the girl on the sand. Those fleeting days when clothes were knitted by our nans, potential stretched out before us with the tide, and all there was to think about was the next bag of crisps.

     New season. New stuff. New camera angles. Director: “And cut to Ref Cam.” Suddenly we are transported from the gliding calm of a wide angle to GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64, except you are not James Bond, you are Simon Hooper peering up at a strange angle of Harvey Barnes. Stop looking around Simon, stand still Simon. As one correspondent to Guardian Football Weekly suggested, it’s the Professional Game Match Officials’ tribute to Uncut Gems. New season – wildly terrible predictions. My Premier League winners Manchester City won the title at Wolves on the opening weekend but are now sensationally out of the race after being outplayed by Spurs. Not sure anyone predicted Nuno Espírito Santo to be leading the sack race (nb: written before Grimsby). Who had Ange to lead Nottingham Forest to Europa League glory? New season – the constants that remind you that football never changes. Manchester United without a win – GRIMSBY! West Ham fans streaming out long before the final whistle. Joelinton avoiding a booking. Bournemouth/Wolves/Fulham fans complaining that you haven’t talked about Bournemouth/Wolves/Fulham enough. Existential crises north of the border. Speaking of existential crises … New season – more children concurrently reminding you of your own mortality and lack of general life achievements. Max Dowman: maybe the first Premier League player born after the Soccer AM “glory years” began (I presume that’s how everyone measures the passing of time). A 16-year-old scoring the winner for Liverpool at Newcastle (long after his bedtime, etc). Rio Ngumoha is 17 on Friday. You’re 16 until you’re 17. Happy birthday, Rio. New season – new directives from the PGMO. Oh, here we go, don’t spend too long on this one. Could holding in the box be the new handball? The thing that has us yelling at clouds. “I just don’t know the rules any more.” “This isn’t why people fell in love with the game.” Now the refs are mic’d up, it feels more NFL than ever. “Holding, No 3 on the DE-FENSE, penalty Manchester United.” Before the season, the head of the PGMO, Howard Webb, said: “If you get one of those situations where one player is clearly dragging another one to the floor in an extreme non-football action, even if it’s off the ball, we expect the referee to see it … If it’s a clear one, then the VAR will intervene and recommend the referee looks at it at the screen because it fits the criteria that we’ve laid out. An extreme non-footballing action which prevents an opponent from moving.” So we have Calvin Bassey v Mason Mount. Bassey very much the senior wrestler – the Ultimate Warrior, with Mount in the Barry Horowitz role. Mount commits himself and Bassey just rolls him, forgetting to pin him for the intercontinental title. Surprisingly Chris Kavanagh wasn’t knocked out by a chair by Sander Berge before giving the penalty. According to the laws, it is a penalty. But as many have pointed out, Luke Shaw is attempting a figure-four leg lock on Rodrigo Muniz at the same time. And then in the second half, Leny Yoro gets away with pushing Bassey in the back before heading the ball off Muniz and into the net. According to the VAR the level of contact “wasn’t impactful”. Now whether you think United taking the lead at Craven Cottage is impactful is a broader question. Perhaps not in the context of a universe that has existed for 13.7bn years, but it did have the impact of Bassey not being able to head the ball, giving Yoro a free header and United a goal. Perhaps the PGMO is thinking more deeply than the rest of us. So here is yet another imbalance weighted against defenders in the Premier League. Already they have to spend most of their time with their hands behind their back, defending against attackers who can move theirs around freely in all the natural positions arms go in. And now attackers can push defenders around with relative impunity. It has obviously always been the case that a defender risks more by pushing an attacker in the box than the other way round. If Mount pushes Bassey over (good luck with that, Mason), he might get away with it, and if he doesn’t, Fulham get a free-kick in their own box. The other way round, as happened on Sunday, and it’s a penalty. Rob Green explained excellently on the all-new (same) Match of the Day that Mount has no interest in winning the ball. He is just trying to stop Bassey – back to the NFL again – and blocking doesn’t feel too far away from a non-footballing action. You have to feel for the officials, because this is virtually impossible to police with any sort of consistency. Attackers can barge into defenders, create space for their teammates to get a free header, maybe get a penalty if they’re lucky, while defenders have to fend off the opposition running into them, without fending off the opposition running into them. And so much is happening in the penalty area that sometimes they’ll be given and sometimes they won’t. The extra scrutiny means there is a risk of more delays and more penalties. And we don’t need more penalties. Football is the best sport because goals are rare. More goals doesn’t make it better, especially penalties. The solution is to give the defence the advantage. If the VAR is staring at a crowded penalty area at a set piece, then if any defender is being fouled, regardless of the wrestling elsewhere, the free-kick goes in their favour. So a new season, a new directive to get confused about. Let’s hope it’s not as impactful as a two-handed shove in the back, however impactful that is.

19) Russia, China slam European nations over Iran ‘snapback’ sanctions move — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Russia said it ‘strongly condemns’ actions of Germany, France and UK as China says sanctions move ‘counterproductive’.
     Russia and China have condemned a decision by Britain, Germany and France to launch a process that could reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.
     The three European countries, known as the E3, launched the so-called “ snapback mechanism ” on Thursday over accusations that Iran has violated a 2015 deal that aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapons capability in return for the lifting of international sanctions.
     The move opens a 30-day window during which a new UN resolution to continue sanctions relief must be adopted to prevent penalties from being reimposed.
     “We strongly condemn these actions by European countries and call on the international community to reject them,” the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday in a statement that blamed the United States and the Europeans for the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal.
     China said the move by the European countries was “not constructive”.
     “The Iranian nuclear issue is at a critical juncture. Launching the Security Council’s snapback mechanism of sanctions is not constructive and will undermine the process of a political and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular media briefing on Friday.
     Iran earlier decried the move, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying it was “unjustified” and “lacking any legal basis” in a call with his European counterparts.
     “The Islamic Republic of Iran will respond appropriately to this unlawful and unwarranted measure,” he said. Hours later, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move by the European countries will “gravely undermine” its ongoing cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog agency.
     France, Germany, and the UK’s ambassadors to the UN said on Friday that, in order to avoid sanctions, Iran should restore access for UN nuclear inspectors, address concerns about enriched uranium stocks, and begin talks with the US
     But Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said the E3’s requirements were “full of unrealistic preconditions”.
     Iranian MP Hossein-Ali Haji-Deligani told the Tasnim news agency that the parliament is planning legislation that would take the country out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in response to the European move .
     The treaty has been a cornerstone of global nuclear arms control for decades.
     “The draft law is on the agenda and will undergo the legal review and approval process next week,” the MP told the agency, adding that given the possible reimplementation of UN sanctions, further nuclear negotiations with the West would no longer make sense.
     The only option, he said, would be to completely sever ties with the European trio.
     Iran says it needs nuclear energy for power, but the West has long feared it is trying to build an atomic bomb.
     US President Donald Trump, who unilaterally took the US out of the 2015 deal in his first term, said he believed it was not sufficiently curtailing Iranian nuclear ambitions.
     Tehran has repeatedly threatened to exit the NPT in the past.

20) UK bans Israeli officials from major arms exhibition — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

     UK government says Israel’s decision to escalate war on Gaza ‘wrong’ as Israel decries ‘discrimination’.
     The British government has barred Israeli officials from attending a major London arms fair next month, as tensions between the two allies escalate over Israel’s war on Gaza .
     “We can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025,” the Ministry of Defence said in a statement reported by the AFP news agency on Friday.
     The biennial exhibition, running from September 9-12, is one of the world’s largest arms trade shows.
     The decision follows London’s suspension of some weapons export licences to Israel, the freezing of free trade negotiations , and sanctions imposed on two far-right Israeli ministers over the assault on Gaza, where famine has taken hold amid Israel’s severe restrictions on supplies of humanitarian aid.
     “The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong,” the British statement said. “There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.”
     A report published in May found that United Kingdom firms have continued to export military items to Israel despite a government partial suspension in September last year.
     Israeli defence companies will still be permitted to take part in the event, but without an official government presence or pavilion.
     Israel’s defence ministry denounced the move as “a deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination” and said it would withdraw from the exhibition entirely.
     Israeli media reported that Britain had said the ban could be reversed if Israel committed to “upholding international law in the occupied Palestinian territories”.
     The move comes amid mounting European pressure on Israel over its continued war on Gaza.
     In May, France barred Israeli arms manufacturers from displaying “offensive weapons” at the Paris Air Show.
     European Union foreign ministers are set to discuss further sanctions against Israel at a meeting in Copenhagen on Saturday, with Sweden and the Netherlands leading calls for tougher action.
     British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signalled a harder stance towards Israel, pledging last month to recognise a Palestinian state in September if Israel refuses to agree to a truce and take concrete steps towards ending its occupation.
     The DSEI arms fair traditionally hosts senior delegations alongside private arms contractors.
     More than 62,600 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed by Israel in its nearly two-year war on Gaza and at least 157,600 have been wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities.
     South Africa has brought a case at the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was in breach of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The case alleges that Israel’s war on Gaza has gone beyond targeting the Palestinian group Hamas, with the military attacking civilians, schools, hospitals and camps. Israel denies deliberately targeting civilians.

21) How triggering snapback sanctions may deepen Iran nuclear crisis — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

     Europe’s move to re-impose UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme will make diplomacy more difficult, experts say.
     By Ali Harb
     Washington, DC – The decision by European countries to impose “snapback” sanctions against Iran may further exacerbate international tensions , experts say, as fears of a regional war loom over the Middle East.
     On Thursday, Germany, France and the United Kingdom – Europe’s largest economies – triggered a 30-day process to reimpose sanctions over what they called “significant” violations of a 2015 agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear programme.
     “What we’re heading toward is the snapback scenario where the sanctions come back and Iran is likely to retaliate in some way that’s unhelpful,” said Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC).
     And the tensions could escalate into renewed violence after the Israeli attacks on Iran earlier this year. “It’s another kind of domino falling on the way toward the June war reigniting,” Costello said.
     The United States, which bombed three nuclear facilities in June as part of an Israeli assault on Iran, has welcomed the European countries’ move.
     But the administration of US President Donald Trump has also kept the door open for talks with Iran.
     “The United States remains available for direct engagement with Iran – in furtherance of a peaceful, enduring resolution to the Iran nuclear issue,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. “Snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it.”
     Costello, however, underscored that Iran was at the table before Israel launched its 12-day war.
     A round of nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials was set to take place on June 15. But Israeli bombs started falling on Tehran two days before the scheduled negotiations, postponing them indefinitely.
     Costello said that, in order to return to the nuclear discussions, the US and Europe first have to rebuild trust with Iran.
     “The overwhelming sentiment in Iran is that those talks were all a ruse – that Israel was going to attack Iran with US support to some degree regardless of what they did at the negotiating table,” he told Al Jazeera. “So both the Europeans and the US have to reflect that reality.”
     The current crisis can be traced back to Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during his first term in 2018.
     The 2015 accord – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – compelled Iran to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting international sanctions against its economy.
     But to ensure that Iran can be penalised quickly if it violates the agreement, the deal included a “snapback” mechanism to reimpose a series of United Nations sanctions.
     The mechanism gave any signatory to the agreement – the US, UK, Germany, France, Russia or China – the power to kickstart a process to revive six UN Security Council sanctions resolutions.
     And the snapback is veto-proof, meaning Russia and China, both allies of Iran, cannot block the restoration of the sanctions.
     In 2020, the US tried to activate the snapback clause of the JCPOA, but the effort failed because Washington was no longer a party in the agreement.
     Since the US exit in 2018, Iran has been gradually escalating its nuclear programme, but Iranian officials insist that the country is not seeking a nuclear weapon.
     Thursday’s decision to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran appears to be timed against the expiration of the snapback provision in October, which marks 10 years after the nuclear deal came into effect.
     Experts say the governments in Paris, London and Berlin are essentially invoking a provision from a long-abandoned agreement to secure UN sanctions against Iran.
     Sina Toossi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said the snapback was included in the JCPOA to ensure that all sides abide by the deal, but European powers are using it to further pressure Iran.
     “The overall US and European approach to Iran has been just brute power – like might is right,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.
     “Anything about legal contacts and history and international norms doesn’t matter. They just want to use this instrument to unilaterally reimpose sanctions on Iran.”
     France, Germany and the UK, however, have outlined three conditions to delay the snapback sanctions by six months.
     The demands are for Iran to resume direct talks with the US, restore full cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, and disclose the new location for its heavily enriched uranium after the US and Israeli strikes.
     Some US reports have suggested that the uranium stockpiles are buried under the now-damaged nuclear facilities, but Iran may have also moved the material before the US bombed its nuclear sites.
     Analysts say that, while the European conditions may seem reasonable on the surface, they are challenging for the Iranian leadership to agree to.
     The European powers want Tehran to recommit to negotiations with Washington, without assurances from the US and Israel that they wouldn’t attack again.
     Tehran had also suspended full cooperation with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after the watchdog failed to condemn the US and Israeli attacks, which it said breached international law.
     Earlier this month, Iran allowed some IAEA inspectors back into the country, but the UN agency still has not accessed or assessed the damage at Iran’s enrichment facilities.
     As for the uranium, Iran fears that disclosing the location of the stockpiles will only invite Israel or the US to bomb them.
     “If they make the location of that enriched uranium very clearly known to the wider world, including US and Israel, then it’s a blinking target for follow-up US or Israeli strikes on those facilities to set Iran’s programme back further,” Costello told Al Jazeera.
     “So because that hasn’t been ruled out, it becomes very difficult for Iran to strike such an agreement.”
     But the three European powers argued that the demands are necessary because Iran’s nuclear programme constitutes a “clear threat to international peace and security”.
     “Today, Iran’s non-compliance with the JCPOA is clear and deliberate, and sites of major proliferation concern in Iran are outside of IAEA monitoring,” the countries said in a statement.
     “Iran has no civilian justification for its high enriched uranium stockpile … which is also unaccounted for by the IAEA.”
     Tehran has rejected that argument, saying that European powers had breached the 2015 agreement first by accepting the US’s 2018 decision to restore secondary sanctions on Iran’s economy.
     Most countries and businesses around the world enforce US sanctions out of fear of being sanctioned themselves.
     The Iranian economy is already reeling under heavy US sanctions with global implications.
     But the UN sanctions – which include an arms embargo – could enable unilateral sanctions by other countries. They may also further undermine trust in the Iranian economy. Already, the Iranian rial fell sharply after Thursday’s announcement.
     “There is more currency depreciation because of the snapback; it’s another psychological shock to the economy,” said Toossi.
     Since the turn of the 21st century, European countries have been seen as a moderating influence on Washington’s hawkish impulses towards Iran.
     Despite abiding by the US sanctions, European leaders had vocally opposed Trump’s exit from the JCPOA in 2018.
     But since Trump returned to office in January, France, Germany and the UK appear to have taken a harder line against Tehran.
     In June, European powers not only failed to condemn Israel’s unprovoked war on Iran, but they also seemed to endorse it. Chancellor Friedrich Merz even suggested Germany and the West are benefitting from the assault.
     “This is dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us,” he said .
     Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Europe’s new posture towards Iran is linked to its broader relationship with the US.
     Iran has been accused of supplying Russia with drones to use in its war against Ukraine , so now Europe sees Tehran as a threat, Parsi said.
     He also noted that nearly all trade between Europe and Iran has been destroyed by US sanctions.
     “Iran simply does not matter that much for Europeans,” he told Al Jazeera in a TV interview.
     “So doing something that endears Europe with the hardline elements in the Trump administration, I think, is something that is seen as valuable in Europe … given how tremendously strained the current transatlantic relationship is right now.”
     For now, the nuclear tensions continue to grind on. The US continues to demand that Iran dismantle its nuclear programme, while Tehran insists on maintaining uranium enrichment domestically.
     Toossi said there’s an irony in the whole affair: The three European powers are invoking a provision of the JCPOA that grants Iran the right to uranium enrichment, but they are using it to align with the US demand for no more enrichment.
     “The hypocrisies and contradictions are just immense in all of this,” he said.

22) Manchester United agree £40m fee with Chelsea for sale of Alejandro Garnacho — The Guardian (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/28/christopher-nkunku-milan-chelsea
   Text:
     Manchester United have agreed to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea for £40m plus a 10% sell-on fee. The 21-year-old Argentina international has been training away from the first-team squad since the start of the summer after a breakdown in his relationship with Ruben Amorim, the head coach. It is understood Chelsea offered an initial £25m before the final fixed fee was agreed. It will be United’s highest-value player sale for five years and the club’s fourth-highest-value sale ever. Only Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di María have left United for a higher price. Due to the winger’s wish to leave, United view the deal as a positive step. Garnacho scored 26 goals in 144 appearances for United after joining the academy setup from Atlético Madrid in 2020 for around £400,000. While Garnacho is heading to Stamford Bridge, Christopher Nkunku is moving away, with Milan poised to sign the forward for a package worth €42m (£36.2m). The deal contains a sell-on clause for the France international, who has agreed personal terms with the Serie A club. Chelsea are also interested in Barcelona’s Fermín López and RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Tottenham, however, have held talks with Leipzig over Simons, who flew to London on Wednesday, and are primed to make a bid. Spurs are determined to sign a No 10 after failing with moves for Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze – and with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski out with long-term injuries. They hope to close a deal for Simons, who Leipzig are keen to sell as they restructure their squad. Leipzig value Simons at €70m (£60.5m), although they may accept a little less because time is tight before Monday’s deadline and they want to push ahead with a bid for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott. He remains close to Jürgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager, who is the head of football at Red Bull. Spurs had a conversation about Simons earlier in the summer but at the time his representatives indicated that if he left Leipzig he would only want to join Chelsea, who had made inquiries. It is understood Chelsea wanted to include one of their players in any move for Simons but this did not appeal to Leipzig, with most of them too expensive in terms of wages. Leipzig have sought to cap the basic annual salaries of their new signings at €5m, albeit they can earn more via performance-related add-ons. Simons is the club’s top earner on a basic €11m a year. Leipzig were one of the teams pushing for Nkunku, who left the Bundesliga side for £52m in 2023. The 27-year-old has struggled for form and fitness at Chelsea. He picked up a knee injury during his first pre-season and was unable to build momentum. He had a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca last season, although he made contributions to Chelsea winning the Club World Cup this summer. Bayern Munich held talks over Nkunku but were interested only in a loan. Chelsea wanted a permanent sale. Chelsea’s position is slightly different on Nicolas Jackson, who may be allowed to go on loan if the deal contains an obligation to buy. Bayern, Aston Villa, Napoli, Juventus and Newcastle are tracking the 24-year-old striker. Chelsea are prepared to wait to see how the Alexander Isak situation plays out at Newcastle before committing to a final decision on Jackson, who is likely to be reintegrated in Maresca’s squad if he stays. Roma, Leipzig and a host of English sides are monitoring the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George.

23) ‘The whole town was out after’: Grimsby fans still in disbelief after beating Manchester United — The Guardian (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     ‘I felt like I was dreaming, honestly,” said Wayne Brightmore, 49, after watching Grimsby Town, the football club he has supported since he was a boy, pull off a historic win by beating one of the biggest teams in the world. “Seeing us beat Manchester United at Blundell Park didn’t feel real,” he said. “It’s dreamland for us, we couldn’t have imagined anything better.” For Brightmore, who is the chair of Mariners Trust, the club’s supporters’ group, and the other 9,000-odd fans that filled Blundell Park, the second round Carabao Cup tie result – a 12-11 win on penalties after drawing 2-2 during normal time – represented a peak for their football club that won’t be equalled for some time. “The pride in the town right now is immense, to knock someone of Man United’s stature out of the cup is something we couldn’t have imagined. It’s as big as it’s gotten for me as a supporter,” said Brightmore, who lived behind the team’s stadium as a boy and growing up, watched its games through his window. Last night was the best day of his life, he said. “I said to my mate before, and I meant it, if that was the last match I ever watched and I died tomorrow, I could die a very happy man.” Grimsby play in League Two, the fourth tier of English football and three divisions lower than Manchester United – who have spent £200m on players this summer. Grimsby stunned the Premier League team by going two goals up in the first half, only to see United claw their way back into the game towards the end of the second half. Dan Halligan, 19, a season ticket holder at Grimsby Town who went to Wednesday night’s game with friends, said he couldn’t believe the result and had just wanted to see his team play good football. “My brother texted me before the game saying, ‘should we go out if we win tonight?’”, Halligan said. “I texted him back saying, ‘Mate, let’s go out if we win a corner’. All I wanted to see was a goal.” Putting on a brave face as he stood behind the bar at Docks Beers, a Grimsby pub that fans attend before games, despite being out until the early hours of Thursday morning, Halligan said he had no regrets. “My hands are still sore from clapping, and I can’t talk from shouting,” he said. “I had work this morning as well, but what can you do? The whole town was out after, so I had to as well.” Not even 24 hours after the victory, the club shop has reported a huge increase in sales, with staff this morning scrambling to go through orders. Kit supplies are running low, with the top worn by the goalkeeper Christy Pym – who admitted after the game that he was “half-fuming” with the result, being a United fan – sold out. The result is so enormous that Mariner mania seems to have gone beyond north-east Lincolnshire. The club shop says items such as mugs and T-shirts designed to commemorate United’s visit to Grimsby are being shipped around the world, including to buyers in Europe, the US and Asia. Roy Wilson, 43, has lived in the area his whole life, but found himself in a similar position to Pym. “I’m a Town fan, obviously, but for one reason or another I do follow Man United as well,” he said. “I felt a bit strange going in but once the game started I was behind Grimsby. Seeing the faces around town today, it’s unbelievable. It just feels really, really special.” Grimsby currently find themselves in the promotion positions in League Two, albeit after only five games. According to Wilson, though, the club should be looking towards a big season. “We’re unbeaten so far this season and we’re playing well; before this game we were hoping to aim for top seven and promotion,” he said. “Now though, we should be winning the league. Why not? We beat United.”

24) Ruben Amorim says ‘something has to change’ at United. What should that be? — The Guardian (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/28/ruben-amorim-says-something-has-to-change-at-united-what-should-that-be
   Text:
     Ruben Amorim apologised to fans after Manchester United’s stunning defeat on penalties to fourth-tier Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and was clear that a line needed to be drawn. “I think this is a little bit the limit,” he said. “Something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.” There are plenty of pointers. Amorim’s stubbornness Being cast-iron sure of your football vision is as vital for a head coach as being confident enough that the vision can be tweaked if results nosedive. Clearly Amorim has an undying faith in his 3-4-3 formation – but seemingly lacks the latter as he did not have the courage to watch the penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby, instead sitting hunched and feeble-looking in the dugout. Adjusting the stance regarding his football vision would be prudent. Wednesday’s Carabao Cup capitulation against Grimsby was the latest evidence of this. It all casts the Portuguese as Manchester United’s Russell Martin: a hubristic No 1 who believes that having an unshakeable blueprint shows he is a man of principle. The logic is easy to follow – and misguided. While players need to be sure that their manager believes in the plan for them to buy into it wholesale. The caveat, though, is this: if they follow it 100% and it still blows up so badly that a paltry 27 points from 29 Premier League games are accrued on top of being dumped out of the League Cup by League Two opposition you have to change. So far the man from Lisbon is not for turning. Address the game model United’s director of football, Jason Wilcox, is conscious that Amorim can be stubborn and while part of Wilcox’s role is to back the head coach, the time is ripe to discuss his manager’s beleaguered 3-4-3 and the chanceless play it produces. Erik ten Hag came under pressure from Dan Ashworth, Wilcox’s predecessor, to adjust his game model. When results did not turn around, the Dutchman was sacked. Wilcox has the power to instruct Amorim to field a different shape so why might he not? Wilcox, plus Omar Berrada, the chief executive, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the head of football, all hired the Portuguese on his 3-4-3 ticket, which makes it tricky for Amorim to be curtly informed there is a loss of faith in the system and the 40-year-old himself. Make Mainoo a starter In a terrible team performance at Blundell Park there were glimpses of what Kobbie Mainoo offers, especially in the first half. He padded about midfield, laying off balls, moving to make himself available, and was able to escape incoming traffic by turning in tight areas: the kind of No 8 skillset Amorim’s United miss. Yet the coach’s current assessment is that a player who scored the 2024 FA Cup final-winning goal against Manchester City and was England’s European Championship breakout star that summer – starting the final – is not good enough for the starting XI. This has been Mainoo’s status since last Christmas, yet United’s results have not improved in his absence. While the head coach’s relations with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have broken down, he has no problem with Mainoo, so why not move Bruno Fernandes back to his regular No 10 slot and give Mainoo a chance as the fulcrum. Goalkeeper farrago Altay Bayindir’s error allowed Arsenal’s winner at Old Trafford in the 1-0 opening day loss and André Onana was culpable for both Grimsby goals. Clearly a new No 1 is needed. Quick. Amorim expects to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp imminently but at 23 and with no senior Belgium caps he surely cannot be an instant solution to United’s goalkeeping problems. Instead, Bayindir may depart should Lammens arrive. If that happens a head coach who does not fancy Onana at all – he was a substitute at Fulham despite being fully fit – will have to pick the error-prone Cameroonian. MUTV grilling sums up United’s mess All club TV channels are Pravda-like, acting as a PR for the head coach and players. But cut to the aftermath of Blundell Park and MUTV tore up the policy up, as Diogo Dalot was given the fourth-estate treatment. The in-house station pointedly asked Dalot whether United should have the talent to beat a fourth-tier side. Dalot’s answer: “Exactly. Not just the quality, but obviously the minimum standards that you ask in every game, the approach to the game. “The best way for us to have respected Grimsby today was to come here and play 100%. I think that’s what we need to improve for the future. I don’t want to go through the same sentence time and again. We just have to show [that] and we just lost one opportunity today to show that we deserve to be here.”

     Ruben Amorim’s tactics and man-management are being questioned by some in the Manchester United dressing room and there is a feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up. Amorim is under severe pressure after the Carabao Cup penalty shootout elimination by Grimsby, the first time United have lost to a fourth-tier team in the competition. The reverse means the side are without a victory this season, having also lost to Arsenal and drawn with Fulham in the league, putting pressure on them before their home game with Burnley on Saturday. United are understood to have no plans to sack Amorim but there is a sense at the club that if results do not turn his stubbornness may prompt him to walk away – possibly as early as next week during the international break – rather than change his methods. After last season’s record low Premier League finish of 15th, the poor run is sparking questions of Amorim from within the squad, the Guardian understands. The head coach’s insistence on a 3-4-3 formation is causing particular scrutiny after earning 27 points in 29 league matches. There is also bemusement regarding his man-management approach, which is viewed by many players as well-meaning but sometimes counter-productive. After the Grimsby loss Amorim said “something has to change” but he is viewed at United as being wedded to his formation, so there is no expectation that was a reference to altering the shape he also used consistently – and successfully – at Sporting in his previous job. Jason Wilcox, the director of football, is thought to be aware of the problems regarding Amorim’s tactics and handling of his players and may move to address these. Amorim also said after the Grimsby match: “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.” United’s match with Burnley is their last before the international break. The message from within Old Trafford on Thursday was that it remained business as usual. United resume after the break with the derby at Manchester City on 14 September. One player who will not feature again for United is Alejandro Garnacho. The winger – one of the players Amorim was keen to move on – appears likely to move to Chelsea. The two clubs have finally agreed a £40m deal with a 10% sell-on fee.

26) Manchester United in a funk after coastal sojourn to Grimsby turns Super Bad | Football Daily — The Guardian (2025-08-28)

     HIT IT AND QUIT IT? Fifty-five years have passed since James Brown, singer, songwriter and minister of new super-heavy funk, released a song about people who “like a dull knife [that] just ain’t cutting”, were “talking loud and saying nothing”. Manchester United would probably have preferred to prompt thoughts of Brown’s I Feel Good but they are where they are – and if they ever do shake their money-makers they could probably then benefit from dropping a few of them. Sometimes we don’t get to choose which 70s deep funk classic we unwittingly call to mind, and Ruben Amorim left no doubt when after Wednesday night’s ineffably miserable defeat by Grimsby he opined about feeling “my players spoke really loud today … At half-time I told them that they were speaking really loud to me. I understand what you are doing, what I am seeing.” Like a dull knife, they just weren’t cutting. In this way United’s players contrasted pleasingly with Grimsby’s fans, who while also talking loud were definitely saying something, specifically about someone getting sacked in the morning. If only the Portuguese could work out how to inspire his charges to get up (get on up). At a push he might be able to take ’em to the bridge, but they would almost certainly then want to jump off it. And now many are doubting whether Amorim will even be able to stay on the scene – like, for example, a lovin’ machine. United’s Super Bad display turned the evening into a classic coastal Milk Cup tie, complete with wildly overperforming minnows (perhaps better described as haddocks on this occasion), wildly overpaid international megastars resembling fish out of water, and a joyful, disbelieving pitch invasion. “I’ve been fortunate enough to go to the FA Cup, European Championship and Champions League finals, but the atmosphere here absolutely trumps them,” said Polly Bancroft, Grimsby’s CEO. It was a game in which United managed to humiliatingly lose, somehow recover, almost win and then humiliatingly lose again. “The way we started the game, we were not even here,” mumbled Amorim, who spent key periods of the match ignoring the action completely in favour of dementedly shuffling tokens around a laminated pitch map, and then the decisive shootout ignoring both the action and his toys while fully focusing on his footwear. It took 26 penalties to split the teams, in the end. This was partly because one goalkeeper, while making genuine attempts to reach the spot-kicks, appeared happy when he succeeded simply to help them on their way into the net, while the other’s technique involved flinging himself to the ground several seconds before most of them were actually taken. “I’m a Man United fan, so I’m half-fuming,” Grimsby keeper Christy Pym explained at the end – and these days they’re the ones who are most likely to be in a funk. QUOTE OF THE DAY Physically, because they’re small, they look like wee boys. They’re clearly not wee boys, and they won’t thank me for saying that, they’ll hate me saying it, but they look like wee boys. There’s no men, you need men.

They just need to have heart, head and a bit of organisation and desire” – Not-tall Ally McCoist on a theory as to how Club Brugge, currently fourth in the Belgian Pro League with six goals from four games, found a way past Russell Martin’s rattled Rangers 6-0 (9-1 agg) in Bigger Cup playoffs.

     Some nights you know, even as they’re happening, will stay with you for ever. Wednesday night at Blundell Park was one of them. A full house, the world’s media watching, and Grimsby Town delivering the sort of performance that will be told and retold in pubs, workplaces and playgrounds for decades. The pitch looked perfect under the lights. The performance was even better. When Manchester United’s manager, Ruben Amorim, admitted afterwards that “the best team won”, it felt like a moment of truth. For once, the cameras weren’t pointing at the Premier League’s aristocrats but at a small port town on the Humber. For once, the headlines belonged to us. I caught the train into town, something I rarely do now. I needed to be early for media duties. My wife drove later with the kids and a few friends. I don’t think I’ve been more popular than I was this week, with United in town. From the first whistle there was belief. When Charles Vernam opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, it felt like the roof came off. Tyrell Warren, once a United player, made it 2–0 after André Onana’s error. United looked stunned. Of course they came back. Bryan Mbeumo pulled one back with 15 minutes to play. Harry Maguire headed an equaliser in the 89th minute. For a moment it felt inevitable, like the story would end the way it usually does. But we held on and deservedly took one of the biggest clubs in the world to penalties. And those penalties went on and on. Ten each, then 11. Finally, Mbeumo hit the bar. Twelve-eleven to Grimsby. Pandemonium. United beaten by a club from League Two. A pitch invasion. The collective joy that only football can deliver. The romance of the cup is a cliche, but nights like this prove why it matters. David and Goliath. The underdog upsetting the natural order. A squad whose wage bill could be covered by one opposition player’s pay packet. And yet heart, organisation and bravery found a way. It’s easy to be cynical about modern football. The billions in the Premier League. The sense that money dictates everything. But this was a reminder of why we keep showing up. It was for the fans who trudge home in the rain after another defeat but come back the next week. For the kids who kick a ball on a patch of grass between housing estates. For everyone who believes football is still about belonging, not balance sheets. And for one glorious night, every seat was full, everyone dared to hope the impossible could happen. It did, and the world had to pay attention. That’s the real victory. Not just the penalties, or the headlines, or the memes about Amorim being “sacked in the morning”. It’s knowing we reminded ourselves of who we are. That we showed, even against impossible odds, that belief can change the script. So yes, Manchester United will recover. Their season will roll on. But here, in Great Grimsby, it’s a night we’ll never forget. To paraphrase a famous Norwegian commentator: Mick Hucknall. James Nesbitt. Rachel Riley. Usain Bolt. Stormzy. Rory McIlroy. Some blokes from Guildford. Your boys took one hell of a beating. Jason Stockwood is the co-owner of Grimsby Town

     Further and deeper into the jungle. Taunted by the quivering vines, mocked by the rubber trees, bitten and bruised by the asphyxiating vileness of nature. Ropes groaning, extras muttering, mud and rock resisting. Rasmus Højlund to Napoli, maybe tomorrow, maybe not. Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, maybe this week, maybe next. Grimsby in the evening. Grim faces in the morning. Kobbie Mainoo wants out. Carlos Baleba wants in but is not going to go on strike or down tools; plenty of time for that once he actually gets to Old Trafford. There will be suffering and there will be ridicule, and there is no shortage of parasites to feed on your corpse. A man on the radio thinks you’re a disgrace. An influencer in a padded chair is shouting “athleticism in midfield” into a webcam. Both are earning handy six figures a year for doing so. The jungle plays tricks on your senses. It’s full of lies and illusions, the stench of disease, the ghosts of dead men, Nicky Butt’s latest take for BetMGM, Bruno Fernandes in a reconfigured midfield double‑pivot. Can you still tell the difference between the reality and the hallucination, between everyday life and the dream? Why haul a steamship across the jungle? Why bring the opera to Iquitos? But of course if you have to ask these questions, you shall never know the answers. Werner Herzog famously dragged a real 320-tonne steamship over the Andes while making his monumental, disaster‑strewn 1982 film Fitzcarraldo. Reflecting on the deeply troubled production, during which several crew members were injured and the shoot was marred by delays and screaming rows, Herzog dubbed himself the “Conquistador of the Useless”, a man driven by allegorical obsession and against his better judgment to see his pointless and morbidly outlandish vision into flesh. Which feels, amid the collateral damage and human wreckage, like a pretty on-the-nose description of Ruben Amorim right now. No special effects, no scale models, no shortcuts; just a fever of warped dreams and misshapen feelings projected at operatic pitch. Amorim will outperform you. He will outrubber you. He will outnumber you all over the pitch. He wants his opera house in the jungle and will ultimately get his opera house in the jungle. But first, he’s got to shift Antony and Jadon Sancho and squeeze Amad Diallo into a slightly awkward right wing-back role. Of course the tickling feather of ridicule has now come for Amorim himself. He’s a mad ideologue, an expensive folly, stubborn and inflexible, wedded to his doomed hulk of a 3-4-3 system, the last man on earth unable to clock that it isn’t working. He keeps saying and doing stupid things. He plays with a little magnetic tactics board. He crouches on the touchline and wears trainers, which is not inherently ludicrous, but we can work with it for now. This has basically become one long endless bit, the gag that keeps giving, an entire arm of the football content industry deeply embedded in the idea of Manchester United being bad at football forever. Against which it makes little difference to point out that United have quietly stopped doing all the things for which they were lampooned in the past: not having a defined identity, not having a footballing structure, throwing huge sums at ageing players on huge contracts. Whatever the problems were, they must now be the opposite: too much identity, too much structure, not enough proven quality. Nor does it help to explain that Amorim’s 3-4-3 is not some stone tablet but merely the framework into which his tactical flexibility is built: allowing for a low block or an aggressive high press, short possession football or long diagonals, stuffing the centre or loading the flanks. Or that 10 months and two windows is really very little time to undo expensive mistakes made years before he arrived. Or that Amorim’s United have actually looked sporadically dangerous in their two league games this season. The fine details, after all, are largely irrelevant. What matters is the cloak of thorns, the constant needling, those sweet rageful feelings. The 1-1 draw with Fulham – a very good performance marred by a missed penalty and ultimately hobbled by neuroses and self-doubt – was a kind of case study in seeing what you wanted to see. Two games in and already the takes are being thrown out of the pram. Ditch Amorim now. Ditch the 3-4-3. And then what? Another rebuild? Another period of crude adaptation, another coach forced like Erik ten Hag to compromise and lose a piece of himself in the process? Another bouquet of fresh-cut dreams? Well, yes. This is what the United industrial complex has always demanded: more turmoil, more upheaval, more bloated failure and waste matter for the detritivores of the MUFC cinematic universe to consume. United can never simply be allowed to breathe, to brood, to be OK at football for a bit. Too much satire in this body politic; too much traffic to drive. We went into football media to tell the untold stories, find the hidden angles, and ended up surrendering to the numbers and leaning into United content in perpetuity. It’s not just the Glazer family that has been bleeding the club dry all these years. The institutional decay is basically terminal at this point; the long-term finances abject, the ownership malignant, the happiness of today mortgaged against the returns of tomorrow and the cultural lucre of yesterday. The ridicule is endemic. The roof is quite literally falling in. The fanbase, by small degrees, has been emotionally disengaging for the past decade. What remains? Who in their right mind can still believe in this? In which light, amid which maelstrom, Amorim’s flawed and final stand begins to take on a faintly devotional quality. Perhaps he may even be the last real thing at United, the only person still taking this project at face value, the only one treating this football club like a football club rather than an asset, a cash machine, an advertising space, a content source, a punchline, a theatre of the absurd. The jungle devours. The vines reclaim. The river always wins. The terrain is unfathomably hostile and every bright new thing must ultimately be strangled. Even the idea of imposing discipline and order on this rampant chaos feels like arch futility, a kind of category madness. Yet perhaps the futility is the point, a silken sporting vision to set against United’s hard corporate edges, a blanket of hallucinations that feels more real than the real. This is his mountain, his jungle, his steamship. And no opera house ever built itself.

29) Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy picks Olha Stefanishyna as ambassador to US — The Guardian (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Olha Stefanishyna, a former top cabinet minister, as Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, ending months of speculation. She takes over as ambassador from Oksana Markarova, who held the position for six years, including more than three years of full-scale war with Russia, and became a target for partisan criticism from Republicans. It was announced in July that Markarova would be replaced. Stefanishyna served in Zelenskyy’s administration as a deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, playing a major role in the country’s integration into western institutions, and as minister of justice. The Ukrainian capital came under a mass night-time Russian attack, Kyiv’s military administration said early on Thursday, with at least eight dead and dozens injured, plus damage to buildings in 20 locations. A kindergarten caught fire, the administration said on Telegram, while mayor Vitali Klitschko said a five-storey building had collapsed. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city’s military administration, said Moscow had fired ballistic and cruise missiles as well as Iranian-designed Shahed drones from different directions to “systematically” target residential buildings. Zelenskyy announced his officials will meet US counterparts in New York on Friday as the Ukrainian president continues to push for a one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin despite Kremlin refusals. “Friday, meetings will take place in New York, in the United States, with President Trump’s team” after “meetings in Switzerland” on Thursday, Zelenskyy said. The real estate developer Steve Witkoff, officially an envoy of Donald Trump, earlier told American media about the meeting. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on Wednesday that he was in Riyadh along with security council chief Rustem Umerov ahead of the US talks. Yermak said the talks in Riyadh focused on paths to peace in Ukraine and Saudi Arabia’s participation in this process. Yermak said they met the Saudi defence minister and national security adviser. Zelenskyy said the delegation would also hold talks on Thursday in Switzerland before proceeding to New York. Russians are suddenly struggling to fill their fuel tanks after weeks of Ukrainian drone strikes crippled refining capacity across the country, Pjotr Sauer reports. Petrol stations have run dry while prices have surged to record highs and motorists queue for hours. Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, has been among the hardest hit. The peninsula, which usually hosts a flood of Russian holidaymakers in the summer, has had its airports shut because of the drone threat, forcing visitors on to roads and piling further pressure on already scarce supplies. “More than 100,000 households” in Ukraine had blackouts on Wednesday after Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, Zelenskyy said. “Unfortunately, energy facilities were damaged. The attack caused power outages in the Poltava, Sumy and Chernihiv regions … All emergency services are working on the ground to restore power as quickly as possible.” Friedrich Merz said “Russia is and will remain, for the long term, the greatest threat to freedom, peace and stability in Europe” as Germany’s chancellor announced a strengthening of its armed forces. The German cabinet has signed off on a draft bill to build up the ranks of military volunteers that leaves the door open to a resumption of conscription, which Germany had until 2011. German weapons maker Rheinmetall opened Europe’s largest munitions plant on Wednesday, a move hailed as boosting western defences by the Nato chief, Mark Rutte. The factory in Unterluess in northern Germany will be able to produce 350,000 artillery shells a year by 2027. Ukraine is looking at how to share battlefield data with allies, the country’s deputy prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Wednesday, calling the information one of Kyiv’s “cards” to strengthen its position as it negotiates support from friendly countries. “The data we have is priceless for any country,” said Fedorov, who heads Ukraine’s digitalisation ministry, adding that Ukraine was “very careful” about sharing it. Large datasets are crucial for training artificial intelligence (AI) models to recognise patterns and make predictions. Nato said all its members were set this year to hit the alliance’s long-held defence spending target of 2% of GDP. The allies agreed at a June summit in The Hague to set that bar higher, targeting 5% five of GDP comprising 3.5% on core defence spending and 1.5% on a looser range of areas such as infrastructure and cybersecurity.

30) Are European powers pushing Iran into a corner with UN sanctions threat? — Al Jazeera (2025-08-28)

     France, the United Kingdom and Germany are demanding Iran make tough concessions to avoid coming under more sanctions.
     By Mat Nashed
     Three European powers have triggered a process that would reimpose punishing United Nations sanctions on Iran for ostensibly not engaging with the international community to reach a deal on its nuclear programme.
     Known as the E3, France, Germany and the United Kingdom told Iran on Thursday that the ‘snapback’ mechanism had been triggered, and that Iran now had 30 days to negotiate a nuclear agreement.
     European officials have sought to emphasise that triggering the snapback mechanism does not mean an end to the road for negotiations, but an Iranian official told the Reuters news agency that the move was “an action against diplomacy, not a chance for it”.
     As the deadline looms, observers and analysts fear that reimposing UN sanctions will significantly escalate regional tensions and embolden Israel and the United States to attack Iran again.
     While the stakes are high, the demands by the E3 –  three of the six remaining signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal – aren’t so easy to meet, experts told Al Jazeera.
     They want Iran to resume negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme and allow international inspectors back in to monitor sites and stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
     The US quit the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed its own sanctions on Iran.
     In April and May this year, it entered nuclear talks with Iran, demanding that Iran give up its centrifuges – needed to highly enrich uranium – and “downblend” its current nuclear programme.
     Downblending is a process where highly enriched uranium is diluted with low-enriched uranium.
     But in June, the US changed its position and demanded that Iran give up its entire nuclear programme, a suggestion Iran rejected outright.
     The US suspended talks, and Israel attacked Iran in June, in an apparent attempt to dismember the ruling government.  The “12-day war” saw the US join in to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.
     Since then, the US has maintained that Iran must give up its nuclear programme as a precondition for new talks.
     Iran has long stated that it has no interest in pursuing a nuclear bomb and that its programme is for civilian purposes.
     Moreover, as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is entitled to enrich uranium for civilian sectors such as energy, cancer research, and other scientific research.
     Trita Parsi, Iran expert and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told Al Jazeera the E3’s demands risk accelerating another round of regional conflict.
     “If you restart talks at a moment when you know that talks will fail, then you ensure that military attacks will happen sooner rather than later,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.
     The JCPOA was signed between Iran and the members of the UN Security Council (UNSC), plus Germany and the European Union.
     The deal stipulated that Iran must not enrich uranium above 3.67 percent, far below weaponisation.
     In return, the parties agreed to lift debilitating UN sanctions, yet any one of the signatories could reimpose sanctions unilaterally if they found Iran was not complying with the JCPOA.
     When US President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the JCPOA in 2018, Iran accused the US of violating the deal and the Europeans of “indirectly” violating it by not providing options for Iran to avoid US sanctions.
     Iran also notified the Europeans and the US that it would increase enrichment levels beyond JCPOA limits.
     Some experts believe Iran was increasing enrichment to gain leverage with Western states for a future deal, as Al Jazeera previously reported.
     And after the 12-day war, Iran denied access to the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is tasked with monitoring Iran’s nuclear sites under the NPT and the JCPOA.
     Before triggering the snapback mechanism, the E3 had required Iran to resume talks with the US, and grant access to IAEA inspectors.
     Some within Iran’s leadership believe the IAEA leaked sensitive information to the US.
     “One position coming out of Tehran is that their cooperation with the IAEA over the years prepared the ground for the [US] attacks…because the US and Israel had very clear mapping and info of the programme,” Negar Mortazavi, an expert on Iran with the Center for International Policy (CIP), said.
     “There is now a big view in Iran’s domestic political space that maybe we should stop cooperating with the IAEA,” she added.
     Iran is reportedly hiding some 400kg (880lb) of 60 percent enriched uranium, a level just below weapons-grade.
     Iran views the 60 percent stockpile as its last bargaining chip vis-a-vis Washington, according to Hamidreza Azizi, an expert on Iran and visiting fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWB).
     He added that Iran is, therefore, reluctant to disclose the whereabouts of that uranium out of fear of giving up its last source of leverage in future negotiations.
     “[The E3] wants complete transparency that removes the ambiguity around Iran’s most sensitive nuclear activities,” Azizi told Al Jazeera.
     Iran has reached out to the US to resume talks since June, according to CIP’s Mortazavi.
     She added that, on the one hand, Iran refuses to project weakness after the war for fear of signalling that it will make concessions if attacked by the US and Israel, while, on the other hand, the US refuses to engage until Iran agrees to “zero enrichment”.
     The US is also struggling to save face after Trump declared that Iran’s nuclear programme had been completely destroyed in June, an assessment quickly contradicted by US intelligence.
     Yet any resumption of talks would be a clear admission that Iran’s nuclear programme is still very much functional, said Parsi.
     Azizi, from SWB, believes that the E3 and Iran should consider reaching a limited and more flexible arrangement to avoid sanctions.
     This could entail resuming limited and reversible cooperation with the IAEA and establishing a roadmap for future talks with the US.
     However, he’s not optimistic that the E3 will extend such an offer because it would like to locate the stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium, which, in their view, is a serious nuclear proliferation threat.
     Iran, for its part, seems ready to accept a deal that grants partial access to the IAEA. Inspectors from the agency reportedly arrived in Tehran on August 27, although the Iranian government said no deal had been reached with the IAEA as of yet.
     If Iran doesn’t meet the E3’s demands, it will come under a conventional arms embargo, face restrictions on its ballistic missile development, and its top officials will have their assets frozen and travel bans issued for them.
     Most notably, Iran will be ordered by the UNSC to stop uranium enrichment, as per the JCPOA. This could give Israel and the US the legitimacy of international law to try and “enforce” this order by attacking Iran again, argues Parsi.
     “When you have a demand by the UN Security Council [saying] Iran should stop uranium enrichment, it means the US/Israel demand will suddenly have the force of international law behind it,” he told Al Jazeera.
     Azizi believes the combination of sanctions, Iran’s hidden stockpiles of enriched uranium and lack of IAEA inspections could lead to renewed conflict.
     “Israel has already demonstrated its willingness to use force again … If Iran were to resume enrichment at scale or show signs of moving toward weaponisation under the cover of opacity, the risk of another Israeli attack would rise sharply,” he told Al Jazeera.
     What’s more, Iran would be prohibited under UN resolutions from importing weapons from Russia or China, which, in theory, would make the government and its people more vulnerable to external threats.
     China and Russia could ignore the sanctions, arguing they were an abusive attempt to force Iran to give up its nuclear programme.
     UN resolutions are often ignored by the US, its allies, and other world powers to protect their interests.
     Parsi argues that the E3’s threat of restoring UN sanctions is driven more by wanting to curry favour with the Trump administration than by any real concern for de-escalating tensions in the Middle East.
     “Europeans want to get themselves on the same page with the US,” he told Al Jazeera.
     “At the end of the day, what’s far more important to the Europeans is that they maintain good relations with the US, not work [to deescalate the situation] with Iran.”

31) Amorim insists ‘something has to change’ after Manchester United stunned by Grimsby — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     A shellshocked Ruben Amorim apologised to fans and questioned his players’ desire, saying they “spoke really loud about what they want” after Grimsby’s penalty shootout win dumped Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup. United trailed 2-0 at the break following goals from Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren. The panicked visitors forced penalties via Bryan Mbeumo’s 75th-minute strike and Harry Maguire’s header 60 seconds from the end. But when Mbeumo missed his second kick and 26th of the tie‑breaker United had lost against fourth-tier opposition for the first time in the competition, 12‑11 on penalties. Amorim was clear the defeat has to be the nadir. “I think this is a little bit the limit,” he said. “Something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think. “Everything [was wrong]. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened – it’s a problem in our club. We should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans. I felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.” Amorim was asked to expand on the last comment. “I think it’s easy for you [to know],” the head coach said. “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.” Amorim was asked if he could believe what had been witnessed. “No, but I’m the manager,” the Portuguese said. “It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I’m really sorry for our fans. Let’s focus on the next game.” Last season United finished in a record Premier League low 15th. Amorim admitted that his side has not improved. “That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today. I would like to say very smart things and very important things but I have nothing to say. “This is the biggest problem also – to see the same mistakes. I’m really sorry for our fans. It’s too much sometimes. You cannot change so much – you cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. “At half-time, I said: ‘We have 45 minutes to try to win the game.’ In the first half, I told them that they were speaking really loud to me – I understand what you are doing, what I am seeing. Let’s try to change that in the last 45 minutes.”

32) US Open tennis 2025: Norrie sets up Djokovic date, Draper withdraws after Raducanu win – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

     Righto, that’s us done for today. Join me again tomorrow at 4.30pm BST, for more ridiculous behaviour, but until then, peace out. Another nails serve and Norrie seals the win, at the end of a pulsating, wild and banging match. Next for him: Djokovic. Will watch! He spanks a brutal service-winner down the T and at 6-4 and on the cusp of four hours, has two match points… Comesana sends a slice into the net for 5-2, but ups the pressure with another confident volley for 5-4. Can Norrie hold it down to serve out? Or not! Norrie shanks a forehand coming in, again with plenty at which to aim, and at 4-2 there’s life in this yet, the match that won’t die. Another error from Comesana hands over another mini-break and this time Norrie endorses it, wrong-footing him with a backhand that forces a futile dive; 3-1, then a netted forehand for 4-1 and surely, surely this is curtains? On a buzz, Norrie takes an immediate mini-break when Comesana nets, but the Argetinian has found a groove now, looking to come to net whenever possible; he sticks awat another emphatic volley for 1-1. Meantime, Valentova breaks Rybakina for the second time in the match to lead 4-2 in set two, but can she hold on to it this time? More forehands from Norrie, then Comesana leathes a backhand, Norrie sets off thinking he’s lost point and game … but it’s wide, just, and from there, he serves out to earn a third breaker of the match having saved three set points. This is such a fun match …and the second when he nets. Deuce, then a magical backhand and, just as Norrie’s fine recovery looks to have switched momentum in the rally, he sticks away yet another deft volley for advantage! Comesana is going for it! He makes 0-15 then sticks in the next rally as Norrie unleashes forehands before coming in off a decent approach and forcing the error! At 0-30, though, he overhits … but at 15-30 he curls a lovely pass that catches his man at the net, raising two set points in the process! The first disappears when he drops long… Norrie forces Comesana to deuce as I go around the courts to see Rybakina leads Valentova 6-3 2-2; Tiafoe leads Damm 2-1 3-3; Mensik leads Blanchet 2-1 3-4 on serve; Townsend leads Ostapenko 7-5; ad Darderi leads Spizziri 6-0 1-2. And as I type, Comesana seals his hold with a net-cord, meaning Norrie will now serve for a breaker at 2-1 5-6. A third backhand error in a row, this time into the net, and Comesana has levelled the set at 5-5! We said this was an odd match and it is, both players struggling to force home their advantages. And have a look! Norrie sends a backhand long, Comesana noises up the crowd, and he’s a pint away from retrieving a second break! More mahoosive forehands from Norrie to win a 25-stroke rally for 15-0., and it’s soon 30-15. Then, when Comesana loops a volley … with half the court at which to aim … he sends a backhand wide! It should be match point, instead it’s 30-all and pressure. Comesana holds, forcing Norrie to serve for it. The way this match has gone, you can’t be sure he’ll manage it. The wind’s kicking up now and Norrie outlasts Comesana from the back to make 30-15, then unleashes two big forehands which allow the putaway at the net. Then another, hooked flat, seals the hold, and at 5-3 he’s a game away from round three. Comesana holds, putting Norrie under a bit of pressure before he serves at 2-1 4-3. This has been a strange match really, neither man quite able to take advantage of their opportunities while it goes as it was always likely to. Norrie’s not finding it easy to force home his advantage, down 30-40, then Comesana unloads a barrage of backhands to snatch back a break for 2-4 in the fourth; on 17, Rybakina has taken over, winning four games on the spin and serving out a 6-3 first set. Back on Grandstand, Martin Damm, a 21-year-old American, has taken the third set against Francis Tiafoe 10-8 in a tiebreak while, on 17, Valentova nets to find herself down 5-3 having led 3-2. Throughout this match, there’s been a sense that Norrie will do whatever ends up being necessary to win, and he breaks a second time in set four to lead 4-1. He’s two games away and, though he’s lost focus when winning, has played pretty well against a tricky opponent. Rybakina finds herself down 40-15 as Valentova looks to endorse her break, but from there she finds a way a to strike back immediately and it’s now 3-3 in the first. Meantime, Norrie leads Comesana 3-1 in the fourth and is three holds away from round three. Grimsby Town have beaten Manchester United 12-11 on penalties! Great work from Valentova, who breaks to 15 for 3-2 in the first; on 5, Norrie whips a forehand cross for 0-40 and yet more break points – he’s had 18 so far. Comesana saves the first but then nets a backhand to trail 1-2 1-2. On 17, Rybakina and Valentova are level at 2-2. I’ve not seen the latter until today, but I’ve heard she’s got something – she’s 18 and a French Open junior champ in both singles and doubles, as well as a beaten finalist in this competition. One to watch, whatever happens today. Norrie forces Comesana through deuce for his hold at the start of set four, but he sees it through, and on 10, Davidovich Fokina has broken Rinderknech for 3-1 in the fifth. At Blundell Park, Grimsby and Man United are taking penalty kicks… Next for her Navarro, which should be a lot of fun. A terrific comeback earns a match against Rinderknech or Davidovich Fokina. Brilliant from Comesana! A terrible memory is a brilliant asset for a sportsperson and he manages to forget all that’s gone before to change up his attitude: rather than play safe as he did when seeking to serve out, he attacks, wins the breaker 7-0, and earns him and us a fourth set. Norrie will also be feeling unpleasant. All that work and he’s down 0-5 in no time … then, as I type, he plays a really good point only to send his volley long. Again, Norrie raises break point, my SkyGo crashes, and returns to see he converts; Comesana will be feeling very poorly at his inability to close out, but he immediately seizes the mini-break then holds for 3-0. What a business he’s making of this set. Elsewhere, Rinderknech has just taken set four to force a decider against Davidovich Fokina, while Rybakina and Valentova are nocking up, the winner to face the surging Raducanu. Going around the courts, Tiafoe now leads Damm 6-4 7-5 2-2; Mensik and Blanchet are level at 1-1 1-1, both sets having gone to tiebreaks; Bonzi is serving for the match having come back from 2-0 down against Giron; and as I type, Comesana breaks Norrie again! He’ll now serve for the third set a second time! Norrie keeps forcing break-back points and eventually finds what he needs, a terrific backhand doing the trick, and we’re back on serve at 5-5 in set three. He worked really hard for that and it felt, if not inevitable, not unlikely. It was a struggle and took almost three-and-a-half hours – Harris’ struggles with injuries are partly responsible for that – but Fritz prevails. Next for him: Kym. Back with Norrie, he leads 2-0 as we know, but Comesana is serving for the third set; as I type, Norrie burns a break point, hitting long. When this happens, it’s never clear whether the winning underdog has had the day of their life – consider Peter Doohan beating Becker and Dustin Brown beating Nadal – or a star announcing themselves – consider Roger Federer beating Sampras or Nick Kyrgios beating Nadal. We shall see, but that was, based on what I saw and what’s being said of what I didn’t see, a terrific performance. Collignon thinks he “played a good match” – I’ll say! He was so nervous at the beginning, playing a great champion, he says in rich baritone, but settled, fought for every ball, and thanks the crowd then everyone in Belgium. Finally, he anoints this the best day of his life, and how proud must he be? How proud must his parents be? This is his main draw debut, and he’s absolutely taken it off the set. Wow! The world no 107 sorts out the no 12 seed, and that was brilliant from Collignon. he might easily have folded when down two sets to one, but he kept attacking and, however tired he was, kept running. Next for him: Lehecka. Ruud saves the first, and Collignon serves into the net; how on earth is he feeling as he navigates the biggest moment of his life, every bit of energy expended and fun refused leading up to this? Er, he sends down a double … but quickly makes advantage. We go again, again he serves into the net, and this is so, so tense… Ruud has to make Collignon play, but two more balls overhit means it’s soon 30-15, then a blocked return falls long! Double match point to the 23-year-old Belgian! Now then. At 5-5 and -all on the Ruud serve, Collignon lets go a forehand and comes in, daring Ruud to pass him, and he can’t the ball flying long. Pressure! And have a look! Though Ruud makes 30-all, Collignon then nails a backhand winner down the line to raise break point, and when the no 12 seed goes long and wide, the world no 107 will serve for the match! Incredible! Ruud looks pretty stressed at change of ends; rightly so, he’s in trouble at 5-5. Meantime, back on Armstrong, Fritz, who struggled early on, is serving for the match against Harris at 5-2 in the fourth. It takes him a while, but Comesana consolidates for 3-1 in the third. It feels like his lead is built on shifting sands – I’d not be surprised if Norrie finds a way back into the set – but for now, he’s doing well, looking to hit more balls to his opponent’s backhand. Ruud is hitting a better length than Collignon now and also looking the fresher of the two, but Collignon is playing with such heart and he fights through a hold for 4-4 in the fifth. This looks a lot like it’s going to a match tiebreak, to be settled by the odd point. Collignon holds for 3-3 in the fifth, giving Ruud all he can handle, while Comesana breaks Norrie for 2-1 in the third. It’s a long way back from here, but he’s started the journey. Mensik has taken the first set amd now leads Blanchet 7-6 2-3l Davidovich Fokina leads Rinderknech 1-1 5-2; and Krejcikova leads Uchijima 3-2 with a break. Have a look! Collignon might’ve faded after being broken, but he sticks to his game plan of all-out attack and seizes back what Ruud took from him, now trailing 1-2 in the fifth; we’re back on serve. Tiafoe does indeed serve out against Damm, leading 6-4, while Ruud breaks immediately to lead Collignon 2-0 in the fifth. Comesana can’t sustain his threat, broken by Norrie who now leads 7-6 6-3. For a while, this was close, but not anymore – likewise on Armstrong, where Fritz, up 2-1, has broken Harris to lead 1-0 in the fourth. Next for her: Victoria Azarenka. Comesana, cheered on by a lad in a Boca top next to a lad in a River top, does indeed retrieve a break, so will now seek to apply further pressure on Norrie by holding at 6-7 3-5. Meantime, on Grandstand, Tiafoe will soon serve for the set, leading Damm 5-4 in the first. At 30-all, Norrie nets a backhand, and Comesana has a chance to retrieve one of the two breaks he’s conceded. But a big forehand incites the error and we move to deuce while, on 17, decent hitting from Collignon secures the set again Ruud, the no 12 seed! They’ll now play a decider, which should be a lot of fun (for us). Oh, and on Ashe, Pegula is serving for the match having broken Blinkova again while, on Armstrong, Fritz secures set three 6-2, so leads Harris 2-1. I’ve switched off Fritz v Harris, which feels over, to see how Collingnon v Ruud develops… On 10, Davidovich Fokina has levelled his match with Rinderknech at a set apiece; Blinkova has broken Pegula back to trail 1-6 3-4; Norrie will shortly for a two-set lead against Comesana; and Collignon is serving to force a decider against Ruud. Next for him: Harris or Fritz. Harris calls out the trainer, who works his knee and hamstring. But elsewhere, it’s all going on – Grimsby lead Manchester United 2-0! Scott Murray has the latest: Norrie is all over Comesana now, breaking to win his fourth game in a row. He leads 7-6 4-1, while Fritz breaks Harris a second time in set three to lead 4-6 7-6 4-1. Oh, and on Ashe, Pegula leads Blinkova 6-1 3-1. She looked really good in the mixed doubles last week, but looking ahead, can she beat a player ranked above her in a major? My sense is not. It’s getting interesting on Stadium 17 too, Collignon trailing Ruud 2-1 but up 3-2 with a break in the fourth. Otherwise, Blanchet leads Mensik 5-4, Fritz is up a break on the ailing Harris at 1-1 2-1, and Tiafoe and Damm have just got going on Grandstand. On 12, Nakashima and Kym are playing a match breaker, four hours and 14 minutes in. Kym leads 7-5 in a race to 10… Now Norrie makes 0-40 on the Comesana serve, the first break point frittered via poor return. He then overhits a forehand and we wind up at deuce, but a miraculous forehand down the line earns advantage, and another barrage elicits the error. This is excellent stuff, Norrie now up 7-6 2-1 with a break. Up 7-6 0-1 40-0, Norrie doubles, and from there, Comesana makes deuce. A fine backhand then secures advantage, the crowd getting behind him, but a wild return sees the opportunity evaporate. From there, Norrie closes out the hold. Again, Fritz makes 0-30 on the Harris serve; again, Harris fights back well, making deuce and burning advantage ... before conceding the break. Fritz leads 1-0 1-0 and might just be asserting himself. Meantime, Pegula closes out a 6-1 set against Blinkova/ However, Comesana then errs and, at 6-5, Norrie now has a service-point to win the set … unleashing a trademark, mahoosive top-spinning forehand on to the baseline for a 7-6(5) set. Elsewhere, Fritz plays a decent breaker to level his match with Harris 4-6 7-6(3); Pegula leads Blinkova 5-1; ruud now leads Collignon 4- 6-3 6-3; Rinderknech leads Davidovich Faokina 6-4 1-1; and GHiron leads Bonzi 6-2 6-4 3-3. I’m afraid to tell you I cannot accept Norrie’s white and white, sock-and-trainer combo. He leads 5-4 in the breaker, on serve; Fritz leads Harris 4-2. Down 5-6 and on deuce, Harris overhits to end a long rally, handing over set point; it disappears with a big serve, then a fine volley makes advantage, Fritz extremely unhappy with the situation. From there, we move to a breaker – as we do on 5, where Comesana holds emphatically against Norrie. It’s a while since we reported from Court 12, where Nakashima has just been broken back by Kym for 3-3 in the fifth. On 5, a powerful hold for 6-5 guarantees Norrie a first-set beaker, but Comesana has some decent support from a few young Argentinians in the crowd. Back on Court 5, Comesana holds for 5-5; his match with Norrie has the feel of an epic and, on Ashe, Pegula and Blinkoca are away, level at 1-1 in set one. That’s a fantastic win and earns Machac a meeting with Mensik or Blanchet next. Ruud has taken over on the party court – I don’t imagine he’s happy to be there – up 1-1 3-1. Otherwise, Fritz again makes 0-30 on the Harris serve, and Harris again holds; he leads 6-4 5-5 and is showing proper grit and skill. Davidovich Fokina, of course, couldn’t quite close out his first tournament win in DC, losing to De Minaur after burning three match points. He found it hard to take, as you might. While that was going on, Norrie saved break point before holding for 4-3; Machac has broken Fonseca for 2-0 4-2, administering a good, honest, old fashioned sonning-off; and Rinderknech leads Davidovch Fokina 4-3. Back on Armstrong. Harris is struggling, down 0-40 on serve though leading 6-3 3-4. He does really well, though, to save all three break points, making a total of six for the match so far, then an inside-out forehand winner catches the outermost splash of paint. He can’t secure the hold at the first attempt but he sorts it thereafter, levelling set two at 4-4. Fritz, the no 4 seed, just can’t get on top of him. Norrie earns three break-back points, then shanks a forehand into the net and overhits another, before Comesana steps in to pound out for deuce. No matter: two terrific points, dominated by that swinging lefty forehand, ease Norrie through deuce, and he levels the first set at 3-3. Ruud has been serving for the second set against Collignon for about four hours now. But as I type, he finally sees it out, having gone from 5-0 to 5-3. While we’re being shown the end of Djokovic, Comesana breaks Norrie for 3-3, then Harris returns; let’s hope he’s in good shape to compete. Next on Ashe: Jessica Pegula (4) v Anna Blinkova. Next for him: Norrie or Comesana, and either match will give us a better steer on where he’s at. Ach, Harris seems to have a back issue that somehow penetrates into the back of his head and also his arm. I don’t remember this, but last year a back problem bothered him in the foot, and he calls the trainer then disappears for treatment. Let’s hope he’s OK; he leads Fritz 6-4 2-3. Djokovic has broken again and now leads Svajda 6-7 6-3 6-3 5-1; he’s almost there. Likewise Machac, who leads Fonseca 7-6 6-2, while Ruud, down a set to Collignon, leads 5-2 in the second, and on Armstrong we’re still on serve in set two, Harris up 6-4 2-3 on Fritz. Comesana, we’re reminded, only won four matches at the top level last season: two at Wimbledon and two at Flushing Meadow. The look of him suggests he fancies himself. Aha, Sky indeed move from Djokovic, now up 2-1 4-1, to Nozza. I always enjoy watching him because there’s no one like him: lefty, huge, loopy top-spin, but also plenty of power. If he plays well, he should account for Comesana. Norrie and Comesana will soon be under way; I’ll switch to them from Harris v Fritz if sky don’t stick them on the main channel instead of Djokovic. Either way, though, that match’ll soon be off our screens because the Goat now leads 2-1 3-0. Svajda has given a good account of himself, but he’s run out of fitness and form. It takes a strong mind to withdraw from the final major of the year. At 23, though, Drapoer has many left, and everything I know about him tells me he’s nurtured a strong sense of perspective. Back to Draper, his statement puts me in mind of this, from Roy Keane’s second book: Ruud had his own traits; he could be moody at times – unlike me. But he was a good guy. He missed a Cup semi-final because of an injury – I think it was the one against Arsenal, at Villa Park, in 2004. He came down the morning of the game and said, ‘I can’t play, my knee’s sore.’And I went, ‘What’s up with you?’ I had a sore hamstring myself. He said, ‘Oh, I’ve been feeling my knee during the night.’ And I was, like, ‘It’s the Cup semi-final, for fuck’s sake.’ He said, ‘Well, I’ve only got one body, I need to look after it.’ I was thinking he was the fool, but I think now that I probably was. I played, and my hamstring was fuckin’ killing me. I think I actually had a torn hamstring. Ruud ended up playing in Spain till he was thirty-nine, and he still looks twenty-one. And I thought he was the idiot. On Sky, they’re mourning Draper, so we don’t see Djokovic serving out to clinch a 6-3 set; he now leads Svajda 2-1 and it’s a long way back from here. And on Armstrong, Harris does the same holding to lead Fritz 6-4. Next on Court 5: Cameron Norrie v Francisco Comesana. Next for him: Collignon or Ruud. Fritz holds for 5-4, so Harris will now serve for set one. Go on Cuz! Meantime, Machac is pressing on, breaking Fonseca immediately in set two to lead 7-6 2-0, and Collignon holds to lead Ruud 6-4. Ah man, sport is brutal. Draper got to the last four last year and will have fancied himself here. He’ll be back. Righto, I’ve moved from Machac v Fonseca to Harris v Fritz because the underdog has broken for 4-3 in the first; as we said, the Saffer can play. Meantime, Collignon is serving for the first set against Ruud at 6-4, so that’s also one that we need to pay attention to while, on Ashe, it’s back to fearing Svajda has gone. The pace might be telling, and Djokovic breaks again for 4-3 in the third. Now then! Just as it looks like Djokovic is assuming control, he hands over a break with a double and now Svajda leads 1-1 3-1. Of course, it may well be that he turns it around but, as he noted pre-match, continuing to play deprives him of family time and, though he’s keen to see how long he can go on at the top level, surely he’ll call it at some point soon. He’s used to winning pots, he no longer can, and however much he loves tennis, which is more than any of us love anything, it’s fair to posit he loves his wife and kids more. Anyroad, while I’m writing his professional resignation speech, he breaks back immediately, and at the same time, Machac outlasts Fonseca to take their first set 7-6(4). So far, he’s doing a decent job of attacking the backhand to take the forehand out of the equation. I nip for a post-set comfort break and return to hear discussion about a potential injury for Svajda, who isn’t moving well anymore. There’s discussion about whether he’s hurt or just struggling with the magnitude of the moment, but after holding for 1-1 1-1, eh calls for the trainer. Meantime, Fonseca and Machac begin a first-set tiebreak, the Brazilian unleashing the forehands his opponent is trying to deny him to take a 1-0 lead that quickly becomes a 1-2 deficit. Djokovic serves out to love, levelling his match with Svajda at one set all. For a while, he looked in jeopardy, but he stopped making unforced errors and it’d now be a surprise if he found a way to lose. Svajda fights hard to hold for 7-6 3-5, forcing Djokovic to serve for set two. Meantime, on Armstrong, Fritz and Harris are under way and 1-1 in the first, but I’m going to stick with Fonseca 5-4 Machac, at least for a bit, and not just because the Brazilian fans are warming up. Otherwise, Lehecka now leads Etcheverry 2-1 2-0 and Collingnon is up 3-1 on Ruud, so that’s another match to keep an eye on on which to keep an eye. At 15-all, Svajda hits a fine forehand winner with top, but from there, Djokovic, beginning to enjoy himself, serves out his consolidation. He leads 5-2 in the second, a game away from levelling the match. However when Djokovic turns it up, Svajda can’t go with him, ceding a break for 7-6 2-4. Is that a turning point? Elsewhere, Fonseca leads Machac 4-3l Ruud leads Collignon 1-0; and Lehecka has just taken the third set 6-2 to lead Etcheverry 2-1. Djokovic makes 0-15 with a lob, but again, Svajda handles the pressure, holding from there to lead 7-6 2-2. After losing the first set, Lehecka has taken over against Etcheverry, leading 3-6 6-0 4-2; Fonseca and Machac are level at 2-2 in the first; and Kym has taken the second set off Makashima 7-2 in the breaker, so they’re now a set apiece. I was really impressed with how composed Svajda was in the breaker, even when serving out. Things might change if it looks on the cards, but he’s playing like someone who believes he can win. Djokovic leads 2-1 in the second, on serve. I can accept the top. The hat and short shorts, less so. On Grandstand, Fonseca has held for 1-0 against Machac, the no 21 seed. I’m going to watch this one on my second screen, at least until Fritz v Harris but maybe even thereafter because the 19-year-old Brazilian is a superstar in the making. And there it is! Svajda ups the pace on the backhand, nailing one down the line; it’s not in the corner or even close, but he hits it so hard and flat that it doesn’t matter! He takes the first set 7-6(5) and once upon a time we’d have know how the match would end; now, though, you sense that the youngster has a chance. Now then! At 5-4, Svajda finds a booming forehand winner that gives him two set points. Djokovic saves the first, but here comes a second, on serve… Next up for her: Pegula or Blinkova. Djokovic goes long on the backhand, his 13th unforced error – versus seven for his opponent – ceding the mini-break. Djokovic, though, seizes it right back and we wind up at 3-3. Elsewhere, Fritz and Harris won’t be out for another 23 minutes; Azarenka is serving for the match against Pavlyuchenkova at 6-3 5-3; Etcheverry leads lehecka 6-3 0-6 1-0l and Nakashima leads Kym 6-5 4-5. Svajda lacks a bit of power but he’s seriously quick about the court – not unlike Learner Tien, I guess – and at 0-15, he’s not far away with a forehand down the line that would’ve upped the ante. In the event, though, Djokovic holds to 15, so here comes the breaker. He might be old and contemplating the end, but Djokovic finds first serves when he needs them, holding for 5-5. I think, for perhaps the first time, he doesn’t believe he can win this trophy – with good reason. If Sinner can whack him on grass, it seems inconceivable he can reverse the result on hard, and to take the title that’s almost definitely something he’ll have to do. Svajda holds, so at 5-6, has guaranteed himself a first-set breaker – at least. Next for her: Uchijima or Krejcikova. Aha, the main Sky channel has now joined Djokovic 4-5 0-30, so I’ll stick with that and move to Harris v Fritz on my phone. Can Svajda find the two points he needs for a set advantage? Looking around the courts, Navarro is nearly there, leading McNally 6-2 5-1. As per the below, I’m not able to watch it, but I expected a little better from the latter – though if Navarro is playing close to her best, there won’t be loads she can do about it Otherwise, Azarenka leads Pavlyuchenkova 6-3 4-1; Lehecka, trailing Etcheverry 3-6, leads 5-0 in the second; and Nakashima is up -4 3-3 on Kym. Harris had to qualify, but he can play – he reached the last eight of this competition in 2021. I expect Fritz to win, but it might not be as simple a victory as some are expecting. Next on Armstrong: Lloyd Harris v Taylor Fritz (4) “Emma, you are one of the kindest souls on the planet but that was merciless,” begins the interview. You’d take it! Raducanu is delighted with her performance and explains that putting in good practice-days every day is helping her build. She’s putting faith in her process so hasn’t had time to pursue her interest in art – she’s walking around Central Park, but otherwise is focused on tennis. A fantastic performance from Raducanu, who meets Rybakina or Valentova next. Djokovic is near the end, but break point down at 2-3 he still delivers a service winner. Meantime… Well in Janie Tjen. She holds to avoid the bagel so, at 6-2 5-1,Raducanu will now serve for round three. Raducanu is serving like an absolute demon, another quick hold giving her 6-2 5-0. She’s nearly there. Goodness me, look how good this is! My kippa is off in admiration. So farm Svajda is doing nicely, 2-2 against Djokovic, and with Raducanu blazing a return past Tjen for 4-0, I’m going to pay that match more attention – though first i’m checking the draw, so well is she playing. And next up, it’s Rybakina or Valentova – tasty. Navarro did indeed take the first set off McNally 6-2; Azarenka has broken Pavlyuchenkova back for 3-3; Etcheverry took the first set against Lehecka 6-3 but trails by a break at 1-0 in the second; and Nakashima is trying to serve out the first set at 5-4 against Kym. I’ve never seen Svajda play before, so I’m interested to see what be brings. To get to this stage he won four quallies then his first-round match, which tells us he’s in form. He holds for 1-0 while, on Armstrong, Raducanua leads 6-2 1-0 and is on her third break point of Tjen’s first service-game. Whether she takes it or not, this contest is only going one way, and a double hands over the break. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Raducanu as dominant, even when winning the tournament. We’re away on Ashe and that’s the other match I’m watching. I’ve no idea why, but you can only access the choice of matches via the app on your phone, which is a right state of affairs: a beauty of this stage of proceedings is having more screens than eyes, discovering surprise belters and generally being absorbed by the sheer scale of it all. Anyroad up, Navarro is serving for set one at 5-2 against dubs specialist McNally; Pavlyuchenkova leads Azarenka 3-1; Etcheverry leads Lehecka 5-3 and has three set points at 0-40; and Nakashima leads Kym 4-3 with a break. On Ashe, Djokovic and Svajda are knocking up. Back on Armstrong, Raducan has two set points at 5-2 15-40, and she’s feeling herself, a hooked forehand winner sealing what we’re told is a seriously impressive set. There’s been a sense these last few months that she’s returning to her best form, and by the looks of things she’s almost there. Word to the wise: if ever you’ve a blocked sink or bath, do not buss bare coin calling out a plumber. Instead, head to your local plumbing supplies store, and buy some One Shot for £12. Or, in other words, though I wasn’t due on till 4.30pm BST, I had planned to watch the start of play, but instead was sent out to purchase the abovementioned, so I can advise you that Raducanu leads 4-2, but no more. Yes yes y’all and welcome to the US Open 2025 – day four! And, as you might expect, there’s an absolutely indecent quantity of lovely tennis just waiting to envelop us in its loving arms. On Armstrong, we begin with Emma Raducanu, the 2021 champion – words almost as befuddling to type now as then – who meets Janice Tjen. Meantime, Emma Navarro meets Caty McNally – I’m looking forward to that one – as I am Arthur Rinderknech v Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Half an hour later, we’re away on Ashe, where Novak Djokovic faces Zachary Svajda, the young American before, over the course of the day, we’ll enjoy my match of the day, João Fonseca v Tomas Machac, plus my reserve match of the day, Lloyd Harris v Taylor Fritz. Nor is that all; indeed, all that is far from all. We’ve got Jessica Pegula v Anna Blinkova, Jan-Leonard Struff v Holger Rune, Cameron Norrie v Francisco Comesana, Jelena Ostapenko v Taylor Townsend, Elise Mertens v Lulu Sun and Victoria Azarenka v Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, with Francis Tiafoe, Mirra Andreeva, Casper Ruud, Elena Rybakina, Barbora Krejcikova and Belinda Bencic also featuring. Phew! In the inimitable words of the worst sporting chant of all time, let’s go!

     Taylor Fritz overcame a jittery start, Jessica Pegula extended her run of consistency and Emma Navarro continued to build on last year’s breakout season as all three Americans advanced to the third round of the US Open with convincing victories on Wednesday. On a breezy afternoon at Flushing Meadows, Fritz recovered from a sluggish opening set to defeat South Africa’s Lloyd Harris 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2, 6-4. The fourth seed, runner-up here last year, was forced to navigate a tricky test against the big-serving Harris, who has been rebuilding his career after injuries saw his ranking plummet outside the world’s top 300. Fritz dropped serve early and ceded the first set as Harris’s forehand found its range. But the American steadied behind his own delivery, pounding 17 aces in all, and dominated the second-set tiebreak to level the match. From there he played with the authority expected of a top-five seed, breaking twice in the third set and riding the crowd’s energy in Louis Armstrong Stadium to finish off the win in just under three hours. “It’s always difficult when a guy like Lloyd comes out swinging freely,” Fritz said. “He was serving great and putting a lot of pressure on me early. I just had to hang tough, get through the breaker, and then I felt like I found my rhythm.” If Fritz was made to sweat, Pegula’s passage was more straightforward. The world No 4, who reached her first grand slam final here a year ago, eased past Russia’s Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-3 on the Grandstand court. Showing the patience and precision that have become her calling card, Pegula broke serve six times and struck 30 winners to close out the match in a scant 64 minutes. The 31-year-old is now the first American woman since Madison Keys to reach the third round in New York for six years running, underlining her reliability at the majors. She will next face two-time major champion Victoria Azarenka, who advanced with a win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. “I knew if Anna got into a groove she could be really dangerous,” Pegula said afterwards. “I just wanted to take control right away, not let her dictate. I’m pleased with how I kept my foot on the gas.” Pegula, who has already collected tour-high 20 wins on US soil this season, admitted that the challenge of solving problems on court is what keeps her motivated deep into her career. “You’ve got to be fearless to play this sport, because one of you is going to lose out there in front of everyone. But when you work your way through and win, that feeling is pretty unmatched.” The surge of homegrown players was further bolstered by Navarro, the 23-year-old who backed up her semi-final run here last year with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Caty McNally. Navarro, who strugged in Sunday’s first-round win over Wang Yafan, was ruthless in exploiting McNally’s inconsistency, converting seven of eight break points and sealing the victory in just over an hour. “It was definitely quicker than I expected, but not easy,” Navarro said. “I feel like there’s something special about being here: the energy, the crowd, it really pushes me.” Navarro’s next assignment is a daunting one: two-time major champion Barbora Krejcikova, a player she beat earlier this summer at Wimbledon. Should she advance again, a potential fourth-round clash with 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva looms, while a quarter-final date with close friend Pegula remains a possibility. The victories for Fritz, Pegula and Navarro ensured a buoyant day for American tennis, offsetting the disappointment No 30 seed Brandon Nakashima’s 4-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (10) defeat to Switzerland’s Jerome Kym on Court 12. For now, the focus remained on the trio of US contenders who underlined their title credentials. “It’s a long road,” Fritz said, “but days like this, with the support and the atmosphere, it really feels like home.”

34) Grimsby beat Manchester United, Club Brugge thrash Rangers, and more: Champions League and Carabao Cup – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     Here’s Jamie Jackson’s report from Blundell Park. Bye! Again! And that’s all from me. Stay tuned for news of the draw, which is expected to happen … um … sometime vaguely soonish? Bye! David Artell has a chat with ITV. He is only vaguely coherent at times, perfectly understandably. But he’s quite kind to Ruben Amorim. I said to them before the shootout started, it’s a technical thing, it’s a psychological thing. Their techniques are fine. You’re going to feel nervous walking up, butterflies, all the rest of it, don’t worry about that. This is the accumulation of 15 months, 18 months, all in one night. Look, they’re an unbelievable team. They’ve got an unbelievable manager, and they’re on the right track. You can see that. But we’ve got an unbelievable group of players as well. Grimsby’s Kieran Green has a chat: We went 2-0 up and everyone was probably a bit surprised to be in that situation. I know they’ve come back but we’d have took 2-2 going into the death. Them getting the equaliser at the end, we’re the team winning at that point because we’d have took that. Before the shootout the gaffer said, ‘Lads, all the pressure is on them.’ And it was, really. John Brewin, meanwhile, saw Rangers get a royal whupping in Bruges: Sunday’s Old Firm derby will see two Europa League teams meet. If Celtic have deep regrets over misfires in Kazakhstan, Rangers suffered a night of near-historic shame in Belgium, utterly incapable of recovering from the first leg performance. By contrast to this horror show, that night of blunder was a creditable showing. Russell Martin’s team made it so simple for an admittedly high-class Brugge side. Much more here: A couple of match reports for you. First, Andy Hunter was at the Hill Dickinson Stadium to watch Everton edge out Mansfield: The first game under the lights at Hill Dickinson Stadium was illuminated by Carlos Alcaraz’s fine finish and the promise of Harrison Armstrong. Everton’s cutting edge may remain a concern for David Moyes in the long term but a potentially awkward tie was eventually navigated in straightforward fashion. Alcaraz broke the deadlock against Nigel Clough’s resolute League One side with an excellent strike from 20 yards. Armstrong, who spent last season on loan at Derby, was the provider and also created Everton’s late second for Beto as Moyes’ team made it two wins from two at their new home. Much more here: I went to Sporting Lisbon last season, not long before Amorim left. Speaking to people there, learning about his impact on that team, he seemed like precisely the kind of character United needed as they seek to return to some kind of sporting relevance. Perhaps not. Twenty-five penalties! What an epic! And what humiliation for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim! Bryan Mbeumo sends his second penalty of the shootout into the crossbar, and it’s bedlam at Blundell Park! There are some people on the pitch! They think it’s all over! Which, to be fair, it is. Darragh Burns sneaks this past Onana, who gets both hands on it but only helps it into the corner! Bruno Fernandes isn’t going to be the one to mess up, that’s for sure. Kabia sidefoots into the right half of goal, which Onana helpfully vacates. Pym goes early again, making Onana’s task easy. So back to the beginning. This is just madness. Pym converts coolly! Sesko’s penalty is as cool as can be, sidefooted to the right of goal. Now for the keepers! Tyrell Warren with the 17th successful penalty of the night. We keep going. Pym decides that De Ligt is going down the middle, and doesn’t move an inch as the ball flies about a yard to his left. Evan Khouri puts enough power on his penalty to get it past Onana, who gets a hand to it. Harry Maguire’s penalty is having absolutely no nonsense. Thumped in, no messing. Seven apiece. Jayden Sweeney takes a fine penalty, Onana goes the wrong way again, and now Harry Maguire must score. Kobbie Mainoo’s penalty is probably the best yet, finding the top right corner of the net. Onwards! Geza David Turi goes low to his left, and Grimsby have a slender advantage once more. That, to be fair, is an extremely good penalty. Pym has absolutely no chance, particularly given that he was over on the completely opposite side of goal. Cameron McJannet squirts his shot just beyond Onana’s dive, and now Joshua Zirkzee has to score! Pym stands up this time, and Cunha waits for him to commit himself, sees that he hasn’t, has to kick the ball anyway and doesn’t do it very well! Henry Brown powers his shot low and just out of Onana’s grasp (diving to his right this time). Now can Cunha win it? Diogo Dalot’s run-up is a little concerning, but again Pym commits himself extremely early and you can’t really do that and hope to save anything. An excellent, calm penalty from Reece Staunton. Onana seems to like diving to his left a lot more than he likes diving to his right. And Mason Mount strokes home to give the Premier League side the advantage! Clarke Oduor misses! It’s an excellent save from Onana, who touches the ball onto the bar! Bryan Mbeumo takes a slow run-up and by the time he gets to the end of it Pym has already committed himself. The rest is a formality. Darragh Burns’ penalty is Fernandesesque, slotted low to his left while Onana goes the wrong way. Bruno Fernandes sends Christy Pym the wrong way before stroking into the bottom left corner. It’s not a great penalty, and Onana goes the right way, but he gives it enough welly that it flies in off the keeper’s hand. Grimsby will take the first penalty. Jaze Kabia has the ball in his hands. Also in the Champions League tonight: Copenhagen have beaten Basel 2-0, and 3-1 on aggregate, while a little earlier Qarabag beat Ferencvaros 5-4 on aggregate. Benfica lead Fenerbahce 1-0 in the final match, in the 94th minute, with the Turkish side down to 10 men. Penalties incoming! Could Andre Onana, at fault for both Grimsby goals, somehow end the evening a hero? He’ll certainly have the chance. Manchester United somehow fail to score a winner! The ball drops at the combined feet of Sesko and De Ligt, four yards out, and is then spooned over the bar! The final whistle has blown in Belgium, and Rangers are indeed eliminated from the Champions League. Mick McCann has news of the DFB Pokal: “Just to let anyone know who’s interested FC Bayern have just beaten third division Wiesbaden 3-2 in the first round of the DFB Pokal with the spawniest Harry Kane header in the last minute of injury time after having taken the lead with the softest of penalties in the first half. Just saying".” This one is also sent to the far post, De Ligt this time the target, but it goes over his head and out of play. There will be five minutes of stoppage time at Blundell Park. United are pushing for a winner. Nearly two of those minutes have been played, and they’ve got another corner. Everton have also scored an 89th-minute goal, and that should earn them ball No29 in the Carabao Cup draw. Jacob Harry Maguire has rescued Manchester United again! Mount takes that corner for a third time, and Maguire runs in from beyond the far post to head it in! United win a corner and Mount sends it into the penalty area only for the referee to stop play with the ball in the air to deal with some shenanigans. Then Mount does it again, and so does the referee. Copenhagen have scored a second against Basel, a Youssoufa Moukoko penalty, and they lead 3-1 on aggregate, 2-0 on the night, with one minute plus stoppage time to play. That’ll do, surely? Absolute chaos! United send a corner beyond the far post, Maguire heads it back into the mixer, and then it bounces around for a few seconds looking for all the world like it’s about to be poked into the net, but Grimsby manage to clear! Nearly a nightmare moment for Grimsby! McJannet has the ball under control, but then it sticks in a puddle, he falls over, and Sesko seizes it. But McJannet recovers and takes it back again with a mildly terrifying but emphatically clean sliding tackle. Joshua Zirkzee is on, and Amad Diallo has gone off. There are eight minutes plus stoppage time to be played. If Grimsby don’t win this, that Cameron Gardner offside decision will merit further discussion. It couldn’t have been more marginal, and would have all but ended the contest. I think we can fairly safely say that Brighton will have ball No32 in tonight’s Carabao Cup third-round draw. But who will have No31? The numbers in full: 1 Arsenal 2 Aston Villa 3 Barnsley 4 Bradford City 5 Brentford 6 Burnley 7 Cambridge United 8 Cardiff City 9 Chelsea 10 Crystal Palace 11 Doncaster Rovers 12 Huddersfield Town 13 Lincoln City 14 Liverpool 15 Manchester City 16 Millwall 17 Newcastle United 18 Nottingham Forest 19 Port Vale 20 Reading 21 Sheffield Wednesday 22 Southampton 23 Swansea City 24 Tottenham Hotspur 25 Wigan Athletic 26 Wolverhampton Wanderers 27 Wrexham 28 Wycombe Wanderers 29 Everton or Mansfield Town 30 Fulham (surely) 31 Grimsby Town or Manchester United 32 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (certainly) United are back in the game! Mbeumo runs at the defence, cutting in from the right, and once he reaches the vicinity of the area he curls a low shot inside the far post. A lifeline! Four minutes to play at the Kassam Stadium and Tom Watson has scored a sixth for Brighton. Grimsby have the ball in the net again, but the flag is up and it won’t count! Gardner was played through and finished excellently, and that looked close. I have been to Grimsby only once, and that was when I was still at school. They had a good team at the time – Clive Mendonca up front, as I recall. I have only the haziest memory of the match. I think Keith Dublin may have been guilty of a defensive howler. Mbeumo sets up De Ligt for a shot, a combination which would be much more effective the other way around. The Dutchman hammers the ball over the bar. Mason Mount comes on for United, ending Ayden Heaven’s personal, um, difficulties. There’s a lot of standing water on the pitch at Blundell Park, but they play on. Fernandes has an excellent shot from 25 yards, which is well saved. Ruben Amorim is currently moving little player-representing tokens around a laminated pitch map, which seems like a completely absurd thing for him to be doing. It has now stopped raining in Grimsby. There was no more rain left. Based on the first 13 minutes of the second half Grimsby seem more likely to extend their lead than United are to reduce it. It would be quite something if Rangers manage to escape the evening with only its second most embarrassing result. Talking of which: “Currently in Bucharest to watch Aberdeen tomorrow night and hopefully they don’t screw up like the entitled two did yesterday and currently,” writes Richard Gibbs. “Would like to see Brugge take their foot off the gas, Sevco get a couple of late goals and Martin stays for another month. Delete that they’ve just scored again.” It’s currently 6-0 there, and 9-1 on aggregate, Christos Tzolis with their first goal of the second half. Another goal for Brighton, 4-0 up at Oxford now with Stefanos Tzimas slotting in the latest. It is absolutely pouring at Grimsby now, the kind of rain that is so thick and heavy that on television it looks like fog. Grimsby continue to bother United, and have just won themselves a corner. Grimsby lead 7-0 on corner kicks! Carlos Alcaraz has broken the deadlock at the Hill Dickinson Stadium and very nicely taken it was too, sidefooted in from the edge of the area. What a chance for Grimsby! So much space on the left for Green, who pulls back to Burns, who should really have scored but his shot deflects wide. A big goal in Copenhagen, where Andreas Cornelius has given the home side the lead against Basel: it’s 1-0 there, and 2-1 on aggregate. Elsewhere Benfica lead Fenerbahce 1-0 both on the night and on aggregate. The only Champions League game that isn’t on a knife-edge is the Rangers one, which couldn’t possibly be less knife-edgy. Brighton have scored again, Diego Gomez with the latest in the 60th minute to put them 3-0 up at Oxford. Manchester United’s half-time changes: Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt are coming on. Fredricson, Dorgu and Ugarte have gone off. Various Manchester United substitutes are warming up at half-time, and some kind of change-up is surely inevitable. Can Grimsby cling on to this? Can Andre Onana cling on to anything? Half-time mailbag! “If Man Utd lose tonight it will be easy to write the competition off but look at the level of the side playing tonight,” writes Kevin Wilson. “That is still a team filled with internationals. Amorim hasn’t turned it around, the results aren’t improving and if they’re not beating Grimsby, what makes you think he will? This just hasn’t worked.” “I had to download my sports channel’s app, so that I could rewind back to the replays and understand what happened for that second Grimsby goal,” writes Kári Tulinius. “I’m still not sure how Onana made such a horlicks out of this, or what the defenders were doing, seasoned pros one and all. How much money will Manchester United throw at Donnarumma, and how will they manage to ruin the best goalkeeper in the world?” “Grimsby have missed the memo!” moans Hamish Williams. “Manchester United will have to make a managerial change if this keeps up, and that would ruin it for everyone. Not even Big Sir Jim can ignore this. You’re supposed to beat them, not embarrass them!” The halftimely whistle blows, and Ruben Amorim has 15 minutes to do some kind of vaguely competent managing and turn this thing around. GOAL! Club Brugge 5-0 Rangers (Brugge lead 8-1 on aggregate)! An excellent cross this one, and a bullet header from Aleksandar Stankovic. Not even half-time, and Rangers are being thrashed. Another for Joaquin Seys, who steals in at the back post to volley a right-wing cross into the roof of the net. I think this will be the last Brugge goal to get a big shouty headline, there might just be too many of them. Grimsby currently lead Manchester United 8-7 on touches inside the opposition penalty area. Their lead is not down to luck. United enjoy a spell of possession, but create nothing with it. Joaquin Seys has the easiest of finishes to put Club Brugge in full, complete and overwhelming control of their tie against Rangers, and he converts calmly. If you happen to live in the UK, you may enjoy Grimsby’s two goals here. You may also not enjoy them, depending on your allegiances: A corner from the right, and Hans Vanaken heads it in. This couldn’t be any more done or any more dusted. This is not a drill. Grimsby take a corner on the left, play it short, swing it in, and Onana completely messes up his attempt to deal with it. He rushes out, makes no contact on the ball, and it drops to the feet of two Grimsby players, of whom Tyrell Warren completes the formalities. Grimsby have the ball in the net again! But the referee spots a handball – the ball bounced up into Gardner’s arm – and it won’t count! Meanwhile in Belgium, Brugge’s Christos Tzolis sends a 25-yarder swerving into the meat of the crossbar, off which it rebounds to safety. Manchester United are losing to Grimsby Town! It’s a fine move, ending with Burns lifting a pass from right to left where Charles Vernam was running untracked into the area, and he took a touch before lashing in at the near post! As if Celtic being knocked out yesterday and Rangers heading the same way tonight wasn’t enough bad Champions League news for one city, Glasgow City have been knocked out of the Women’s competition. Here’s PA Media: Glasgow City’s hopes of reaching the Women’s Champions League were ended as Austria Wien recorded a 2-0 second qualifying round victory. There was little between the two sides in the first half as Glasgow competed well at the Franz Horr Stadium in Vienna. Katharina Schiechtl fired the Austrians ahead four minutes after the interval with a direct free-kick. Glasgow stayed in the game and Sofia Maatta went close to an equaliser 12 minutes from time. The tie was put beyond Glasgow in the third minute of stoppage time after Almedina Sisic set up fellow substitute Maria Olsen. Emily Whelan almost claimed a consolation for the Scottish visitors when her effort bounced off the woodwork with almost the last kick of the match. Fifteen minutes played at Blundell Park and there has so far been one shot on target, Grimsby leading Manchester United 1-0 on those. No actual goals, though. A long ball and a suicidally high defensive line combine to undo Rangers. Tzolis looks set to run clear, until Max Aarons pulls him back and brings him down. And that is the very definition of a professional foul. Raul Jimenez for Fulham and Brajan Gruda for Brighton, both of whom now revel in 2-0 leads. And that is surely curtains for Rangers! It’s a splendid cross from the left, and Nicolo Tresoldi stoops at the near post to power in the header! Rangers will have to learn how to deal a bit better with the pace of Carlos Forbs on the right of the Brugge attack, because scything him down in full flight is not a long-term solution. They give away a free-kick, which is curled out of play. There have already been a couple of Carabao Cup goals, both in 7.45pm kick-offs: Olivier Boscagli has given Brighton the lead at Oxford, while a George Tanner own goal has handed Fulham the advantage at home to Bristol City. BONG! The time is 8pm, and the football has begun (those games that hadn’t already begun)! A few minutes before kick-off o’clock, and teams are emerging from tunnels! Fireworks explode over the Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium after Clement Turpin blows the final whistle – Qarabag lost 3-2 to Ferencvaros, but won 5-4 on aggregate to claim their place in the leaguey bit! The starting lineups for tonight’s four Carabao Cup games are here: Everton v Mansfield Everton: Travers, Coleman, Tarkowski, Keane, Mykolenko, Garner, Armstrong, McNeil, Alcaraz, Grealish, Barry.

Referee: Oliver Langford. Alex Toth has just scored an absolute screamer to put Ferencvaros 3-2 up at Qarabag, and they need one more goal in the last 10 minutes or so to take the game into extra time. Qarabag and Ferencvaros are currently drawing 2-2 in the early kick-off, with Qarabag therefore nursing a 5-3 aggregate advantage. The lineups for the late Champions League games, meanwhile, are here: Benfica v Fenerbahce Benfica: Trubin, Dedic, Antonio Silva, Otamendi, Dahl, Rios, Barrenechea, Aursnes, Barreiro, Akturkoglu, Pavlidis.

Subs: Salvi, Pfeiffer, Koindredi, Bacanin, Ajeti, Ruegg, Kacuri, Cisse, Ze, Rexhaj, Akahomen, Kaio Eduardo. Referee: Istvan Kovacs (Romania). Not quite so many matches tonight as there were yesterday, but it’s about quality not quantity and after Celtic stunk out Tuesday evening there’s definite room for improvement there. We’ve got just four Champions League fixtures to keep an eye out for, one of which started a while ago, and precisely the same number of Carabao Cup games.

     Manchester United – bloody hell. After a quasi-farcical display that somehow pulled them back to 2-2 and penalties, Ruben Amorim’s rabble lost a fevered shootout 12-11. When Bryan Mbeumo’s kick smacked Christy Pym’s bar Grimsby entered the nirvana of a cup shock for the ages, delirious home fans invaded, and their song of “Oh when the Town go steaming in” sweetly summed up what had been administered to United. The visitors were two down by the interval when Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren strikes had the 20‑time English champions staring at a humiliating oblivion. However, a 75th-minute Mbeumo finish handed United a lifeline before Harry Maguire’s stooping header squeezed in at the near post took the tie to the penalty lottery. Amorim’s men lost it – so the inquest begins. The head coach and his side hobble next to the visit of Burnley on Saturday. It does not need a vivid imagination to picture United losing that one too and extending their winless run to the opening four outings of an already stricken campaign. Amorim may survive a defeat at Old Trafford – he has just overseen a £200m-plus summer spend, after all – but the bottom line is this: nine months into the job the head coach continues to put out a team that lack verve, flair, solidity and anything approaching a discernible pattern of play. After the farrago of his side’s performance Amorim stood pitchside and was regaled with jubilant verses of “you’re getting sacked in the morning”: this cruel wit sharply crystallises the state United are in – and their coach is culpable. On a smooth green sward that allowed no excuse the XI Amorim sent out in search of a win showed eight changes. Of these Kobbie Mainoo, Benjamin Sesko, André Onana, Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte were the headline acts given first starts and who failed to quieten a rambunctious crowd all night. United began and ended under the pump. A Vernam corner from the left threatened to arrow over the hapless Onana before the goalkeeper scurried back and tipped over. Dave Artell drilled his unit to tap the ball about then up tempo and stampede at United. Or rush to a man in red livery to squeeze them – precisely how they took the lead. Under pressure Amad Diallo miscontrolled, tried to retrieve the ball, he and Ugarte bumped into each other, pratfalled, and Grimsby took over. A quick right-left Darragh Burns diagonal put Vernam in, and he beat Onana at his near post: the Cameroonian should have saved so here was the latest howler from a United man between the sticks. Now, the Mariners’ second. A short Vernam corner on the left was returned and the No 30 sliced in a delivery. Onana rose above a thicket of players and, farcically, missed a clearing punch, the ball dropped to Warren, who rolled home against the club he left in 2019. Cue a Grimsby support in party mode, their taunts a cutting “can we play you every week”, and “Premier League/you’re having a laugh”. They had a point. Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shellshocked guest. When Sesko managed a header you were reminded that United were allowed to attack – too. At the interval Amorim hooked Tyler Fredericson, Patrick Dorgu and Ugarte for Matthijs De Ligt, Mbuemo and Bruno Fernandes. Calling for the cavalry showed how dire United were. In bucketing rain Grimsby poured forward and a Burns effort went for a corner as, again, United’s noses were bloodied. The downpour, becoming biblical, made the surface greasy – perfect for a side on a mission to pen themselves into football immortality. United were in a catch-22 of needing to press to pull a goal back while not daring to leave space for Artell’s ruthless unit to prosper again. Example: Grimsby moved along their right, swapped passes, and lifted a high-ball in – the omnipotent Vernam leaped and bounced a header into the ground which Onana clutched. Amorim’s substitutions had failed to engineer any dominance and when Diallo was flagged offside his manager dipped his head in anguish – a regular sensation for him. Amorim, despairing, sent for a favourite player, Mason Mount, who replaced Ayden Heaven. Yet when Mbeumo struck United still seemed a universe away from levelling. But they do possess spirit, as personified by Maguire whose intervention took them to penalties and the heartbreak of defeat this way. Amorim was not spotted on the touchline witnessing the kicks – as odd as the decision to have his new £70m leader of the attack, Sesko, as taker No 10. Again, expect this to be dissected.

36) DC mayor says she ‘greatly appreciates’ Trump’s surge of federal officers but adds there is ‘break in trust’ with residents – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

     Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is being ousted from the position less than a month after being sworn in, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing multiple Trump administration officials familiar with the matter. The Washington Post did not cite a reason for the departure. Citing several anonymous CDC employees, the newspaper reported that Monarez on Friday canceled an agency-wide call that had been scheduled for Monday. The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately provide comment. Monarez, a federal government scientist, was confirmed by the Senate on 29 July and sworn in by Robert F Kennedy Jr two day later. Her departure comes after a police officer was killed in a shooting at the CDC. Donald Trump has ordered the American flag to be flown at half-staff at the White House and across federal buildings until 31 August, following the mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis which killed two children and injured 17 people. My colleagues are tracking the latest developments here. Earlier, DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, held a press conference to discuss the federal takeover of the DC police. The mayor balanced deference towards Trump with occasional bursts of defiance. Bowser said that while she “greatly appreciates” the impact of the federal law enforcement surge on district crime (pointing to the substantial decrease in carjackings compared to this time last year), there was ultimately a “break in trust” between officers and local residents. “We know having masked Ice agents in the community has not worked, and national guard from other states has not been an efficient use of those resources,” she added. Bowser said she has a “courtesy meeting” with the president today, where they did not discuss any of his plans to extend the federal takeover beyond 30 days (a move that would require congressional approval). The mayor did say that Trump’s “knowledge of DC” appeared to have “significantly increased” from the first term in office. She declined to offer any details about her “substantive” conversation with attorney general Pam Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Bowser offered glimpses of pushback against the administration when taking questions from reporters. She said was was “devastated” to hear that immigrants in DC are living in fear of being arrested by Ice agents, and claimed that if the Metropolitan police department had more officers –a recurring plea from DC government – local law enforcement wouldn’t require any federal intervention. Staying in the nation’s capital, The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said that his department is taking back control of Union Station from Amtrak –the railroad company that receives federal subsidies and has managed the daily operations of the DC transportation hub for over a year. At a launch event for a new fleet of high-speed trains today, Duffy said that the station has been “neglected for decades”. He added that reclaiming station management “will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.” Meanwhile, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said on CNN today that Donald Trump hasn’t “made a final call” on when he plans to nominate a replacement for Lisa Cook – the Federal Reserve governor he moved to fire this week. Hassett’s comment came after Trump suggested at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he had a candidate in mind. Cook has not been charged with a crime, and is expected to file a lawsuit challenging her attempted firing. Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled Wednesday that Kilmar Ábrego García cannot be deported again until at least early October. Judge Paula Xinis has set a hearing for 6 October on the administration’s plans to deport Ábrego. His lawyers also said their client wants to seek asylum in the US, for fear of torture and persecution if deported to Uganda. California Republicans are proposing a “two-state solution” for the Golden State. James Gallagher, the top Republican in the California assembly, unveiled a resolution on Wednesday that would split the state in two – their response to the Democrats’ attempt to redraw the congressional boundaries in the state, itself a response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas. The provocatively named proposal – adopting a phrase more often used in reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – is a political nonstarter. But it underscores the new messaging Republicans in the state plan to use to rally opposition to the ballot initiative in November. Gallagher argued that the redistricting push would further “silence rural voices and rig the political system against them forever” in California. “I have come to see that the only way we can obtain proper attention is by pursuing our own statehood. With this measure, we will begin the first step of that process,” he said. The Republican plan would divide California vertically, splitting the deep-blue slice of the coast from the more rural and red inland. According to Gallagher, it would create a state with a population of more than 10 million people – making it one of the 10 most populous states in the US. “Whether you are from the north state, Central valley, or the Inland Empire, life has become harder and completely unaffordable,” the Republican leader explained. “We have been overlooked for far too long, and now they are trying to rip away what little representation we have left.” The referendum, led by the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, will ask voters to approve a gerrymander aimed at securing five more Democratic House seats in California to offset the five new Republican-heavy districts created by the Texas legislature. “We will not be subject to a state that deprives us of a fair voice,” he said. “Gavin, let my people go.” Florida’s immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” will probably be empty of detainees within days, a state official has said, indicating compliance with a judge’s order last week that the facility must close. The Republican governor Ron DeSantis’s administration appealed the order by federal court judge Kathleen Williams that the tented detention camp in the Florida Everglades, which attracted criticism for its harsh conditions, must be dismantled within 60 days. But in an email reported Wednesday by the Associated Press, Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida department of emergency management, which operates the jail on behalf of the federal government, appeared to confirm it would be shuttered. “We are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” Guthrie wrote to Mario Rojzman, a Miami Beach rabbi who has been helping to arrange chaplaincy services. Representatives for Rojzman confirmed the authenticity of the memo to the news agency. Guthrie’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Miami Herald had previously reported that hundreds of detainees were moved from “Alligator Alcatraz” to other immigration facilities in the state in advance of Williams’s’ ruling. Donald Trump has ordered the American flag to be flown at half-staff at the White House and across federal buildings until 31 August, following the mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis which killed two children and injured 17 people. A reminder that my colleagues are bringing you the latest developments from Minneapolis. Grand jurors have rebuffed federal prosecutors by refusing to approve a criminal indictment against a man who allegedly threw a sandwich at a law enforcement agent in protest against Donald Trump’s deployment of armed troops on the streets of Washington DC. It is the second time in recent days that a grand jury had declined to vote to indict a person accused of assaulting a federal officer and signaled strong public objection to Trump’s decision to send national guard troops and federal agents onto the streets of the US capital, purportedly to crack down on violent crime. The case of Sean Charles Dunn, who was accused of hurling the sub-style sandwich, became a cause celebre after video of the episode went viral on social media. Dunn, 37, a former justice department paralegal, was initially charged on 13 August after being accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer who was patrolling an area of Washington’s north-west district known for its bars and restaurants with other agents. The DC mayor said officials will “answer any questions” that are posed to local government, when it comes to the House oversight committee’s investigation into allegations of manipulated DC crime statistics. On Monday, Republican congressman James Comer, who chairs the committee, asked the DC police chief, Pamela Smith, for transcribed interviews with the seven commanders of DC’s patrol districts. Bowser also confirmed today that there was no update on the internal Metropolitan police department investigation – after local reports of a former DC commander facing accusations from the police union of falsifying data. Earlier, Bowser said that she was “devastated” by immigrants in DC living fear during the surge of federal law enforcement in the nation’s capital. I think you know very clearly how I feel about our nation needing comprehensive immigration reform, about Congress establishing a pathway to citizenship for hardworking people who came to this country for a better life, and who are not criminals, who are law abiding. And I think when that question is finally answered, that’s the only way to deal with this fear, or to deal with these agencies going after law-abiding people. Bowser is now addressing a direct question from a reporter about whether she pushed back in her meeting with the president, particularly when it comes to the anger from DC residents at the federal law enforcement presence in the district, and the use of masks covering the faces of agents. She characterizes her discussion with Trump as a “courtesy meeting”, but says that she had a “substantive” conversation with the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, but declined to discuss the details of her meeting. Boswer confirms that the Metropolitan police department is “supporting the ask” of the administration to assist Ice agents with immigration enforcement efforts. A notable exchange at this press conference. A reporter asked how Bowser can be sure that MPD officers wouldn’t have made all the arrests illustrated today on those charts without the additional federal law enforcement. “Let me put it this way, if there were 500 additional MPD officers…that same activity, arrests and gun recovery would have likely been made,” Bowser said, underscoring the city’s aim to increase the number of local police. Bowser also just said that when she spoke to the president earlier today, they didn’t talk about his possible plan to try to extend the federal takeover of the DC police beyond 30 days. A reminder: Trump would need congressional approval for an extension, according to section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act. Reporters are now asking questions, and the mayor says the number of cited arrests (more than 1,500) represents a combined number – from both the Metropolitan police department (MPD) and federal law enforcement. However, she says this number might not include all federal arrests. The DC mayor says that despite statistics that show a reduction in crime, the “break in trust” between police and the local community is “not working”. She says this is particularly apparent between federal law enforcement and DC locals. “We know having masked Ice agents in the community has not worked, and national guard from other states has not been an efficient use of those resources,” she adds. A short while ago, Muriel Bowser said that her office “will be supportive” of Donald Trump’s $2bn “beautification” request to Congress. “We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what MPD has been able to do in this city,” Bowser says. She cites police data which shows there has been an 87% reduction in carjackings in DC over the last 20 days, compared to the same period last year. Boswer then says she spoke with Donald Trump today, and that she was “reminded” of their first meeting after his re-election earlier this year. “We discussed shared priorities for the district,” Bowser adds. “I was reminded that the president’s interest in cities predates his time in office, and his knowledge of DC had significantly increased from the first time he was in the White House.” The deputy mayor for public safety and justice, Lindsey Appiah, is now talking about the hiring push for the DC police department. “We continue to do that work to stabilize, and to increase our for strength to what we believe is where we need to be – 3,800 to 4,000 officers,” she says. Bowser is now speaking, and says she’s providing a “situational update” on the surge of federal law enforcement in DC. “I always want to remind people give you a quick little primer of who we are in Washington, DC,” Bowser adds. “We function as a city, county and state…We pay federal taxes. In fact, we pay more per capita than most places, and we get back less.” The pre-amble that Boswer is giving seems to be a pointed refresher on what the limited rights and representation of the district. The mayor of DC, Muriel Bowser, is about to hold a press conference to give an update on the federal takeover of law enforcement in the nation’s capital. The Trump administration aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media, according to a proposed government regulation issued today, part of a broader crackdown on legal immigration. This latest move would create new hurdles for international students, exchange workers and foreign journalists who would have to apply to extend their stay in the US rather than maintain a more flexible legal status. The proposed regulation would create a fixed time period for F visas for international students, J visas that allow visitors on cultural exchange programs to work in the US, and I visas for members of the media. Those visas are currently available for the duration of the program or US-based employment. There were about 1.6 million international students on F visas in the US in 2024, according to US government data. The US granted visas to about 355,000 exchange visitors and 13,000 members of the media in fiscal year 2024, which began on 1 October 2023. The student and exchange visa periods would be no longer than four years, the proposed regulation said. The visa for journalists – which currently can last years – would be up to 240 days or, in the case of Chinese nationals, 90 days. The visa holders could apply for extensions, the proposal said. The Trump administration said in the proposed regulation that the change was needed to better “monitor and oversee” the visa holders while they were in the United States. The public will have 30 days to comment on the measure, which mirrors a proposal put forward in 2020 at the end of Trump’s first term in office. The Trump administration has increased scrutiny of legal immigration, revoking student visas and green cards over ideological views and stripping legal status from hundreds of thousands of migrants. In a 22 August memo, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would resume long-dormant visits to citizenship applicants’ neighborhoods to check what it termed residency, moral character and commitment to American ideals. US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s announcement that Donald Trump is to chair a “large” White House meeting on Gaza later today to discuss the “comprehensive plan” the administration is putting together for the so-called day after is notable as it appears this is the first time that Witkoff has revealed the existence of such a plan, the Times of Israel writes. He told Fox News yesterday: “Many people are going to see how robust it is and how well-meaning it is, and it reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives.” You may remember that Trump made headlines last month when he said he’d be unveiling a new plan to get aid into Gaza, but never followed through. With so much at stake for Palestinian people still in Gaza, we’ll bring you more on the meeting as we get it through the afternoon. Former British prime minister Tony Blair and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner will participate in the meeting on Gaza at the White House later today and present the president with ideas for a post-war plan, Axios is reporting, citing two sources with knowledge. The meeting will also include a discussion of how to increase aid flows into Gaza, according to Axios. The devastated territory is experiencing a widespread, man-made famine, with a quarter of all Palestinian people there starving as a result of Israel’s obstruction of aid. My colleague, Tom Ambrose, is covering the developments in the Middle East today, as Israel carries out a raid in the in the old city of Nablus, and ten Palestinians have died from starvation in the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Today, Donald Trump is also expected to chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House, according to special envoy Steve Witkoff. Tom will bring you the latest as it happens. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said on CNN today that Donald Trump hasn’t “made a final call” on when he plans to nominate a replacement for Lisa Cook – the Federal Reserve governor he moved to fire this week. Hassett’s comment came after Trump suggested at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he had a candidate in mind. Asked about possible replacements for Cook during his marathon televised cabinet meeting, Trump said: “We have some very good people for that position.” “I think, maybe in my own mind, I have somebody that I like,” Trump added, before saying that he would also consult Scott Bessant, the treasury secretary, and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary. A reminder that Cook has not been charged with a crime, and her lawyer has said the president has “no authority” to remove her from her position. Trump has claimed that Cook has engaged in mortgage fraud, and noted that he has “some very good people” in mind to replace her while taking questions during his three-hour long cabinet meeting on Tuesday. In his CNN interview, Hassett said that the president would “respect judgment of the legal system”, possibly referring to the lawsuit that Cook is expected to file to challenge her attempted firing. The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said that his department is taking back control of Union Station from Amtrak –the railroad company that receives federal subsidies and has managed the daily operations of the DC transportation hub for over a year. At a launch event for a new fleet of high-speed trains, Duffy said that the station has been “neglected for decades” and is “showing its age”. “By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost,” Duffy added. Donald Trump said that he has been “fully briefed” on the school shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, today. “The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” the president wrote on Truth Social. Local authorities said a shooting occurred during at Annunciation Catholic school in south Minneapolis. At least five children have been injured. The shooter has been “contained” and there is no “active threat” to residents, according to Minneapolis city officials. Earlier today, Kilmar Ábrego García’s lawyers said their client wants to seek asylum in the US, for fear of torture and persecution if deported to Uganda. The district federal judge presiding, Paula Xinis, said that this would be operate on a “separate track” from the habeas corpus lawsuit Ábrego’s lawyer filed this week. Judge Xinis has set a hearing for 6 October on the administration’s plans to deport Ábrego. The judge added that Ábrego cannot be deported until then, extending the temporary restraining order which stipulates that Ábrego must remain at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility where he is currently detained. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said that federal law enforcement made 84 arrests on Tuesday in the nation’s capital. She added that there have been 1,178 total arrests since the beginning of the surge in DC earlier this month. Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago had already made it past the security line at the El Paso airport when two border patrol agents called her in for questioning and whisked her away to an immigration detention center. Nearly a month after her arrest, she and her family still aren’t clear why she is detained. Santiago is a beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program – which has allowed her to legally live and work in the US. “They have no legal basis for why they detained her or why they’re holding her or why they’re trying to deport her,” said her spouse, Desiree Miller. And immigration officials have yet to provide her or her family any clear answers, she added. Since her arrest on 3 August, Santiago’s case has alarmed immigration advocates across the US, as it illustrates the increasing vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of young people who arrived in the US as children and were granted temporary protections from deportation through the Obama-era Daca program. Although there have been no regulatory changes to the program, the administration has tried to strip 525,000 Daca recipients, also known as Dreamers, of benefits. In July, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security assistant press secretary, claimed, falsely, that “Daca does not confer any form of legal status in this country” and urged recipients to self-deport. A reminder that my colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest news out of Denmark, following local media uncovering a network of “at least three” people working on “influence operations” in Greenland to drive a wedge between Denmark and the territory, in a bid to pave the way for it to get closer to the US. Denmark has summoned theacting US diplomat. This all comes as Donald Trump has expressed unrelenting interest for the US to acquire Greenland, despite Denmark’s insistence that the island is not for sale. The president posted up a storm on Truth Social overnight. “Republicans: BAN MAIL-IN VOTING!!!” Trump wrote just hours ago, renewing his most recent calls to undermine mail-in ballots – a voting method that he and the first lady have used in the past. It’s worth noting that almost a third of voters used mail-in ballots in the 2024 election, according to a report from the US Election Assistance Commission. In an earlier post, the president said that the House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate majority leader, John Thune, were working with him on a “comprehensive crime bill” with the promise that he’ll eventually reveal more details about the legislation. Trump has said that he’s also speaking with both leaders about potentially billions of dollars in congressionally guaranteed funds to help with his “beautification” project in DC. The president doesn’t have any events on his public schedule from which we can expect to hear from him today. He’s due to have lunch with JD Vance at 12:30pm ET, and special envoy Steve Witkoff said, in an appearance on Fox News, that the president would also chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Wednesday that “everything is on the table” in trade talks with China and that he will be meeting again with his Chinese counterpart at the end of October or beginning of November. “It’s a very complicated relationship,” he said in an interview on Fox Business’ Mornings With Maria program. “We are moving very deliberately on this. Both sides have approached it with great respect.” Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”. As reporters shouted questions after the US delegation’s meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We’re going to have a different set of rules … please be quiet for a moment. “The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone,” he said. “Act civilised, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what’s happening in the region,” added Barrack, who has recently been leading talks with Lebanese officials. The Lebanese presidency in a statement on X expressed regret at “remarks made inadvertently from its podium by one of its guests”, affirming its appreciation for the journalists and media representatives. The information minister, Paul Morcos, in a statement also expressed regret at the remarks “by a member of the foreign delegation towards media representatives at the presidential palace”. The photojournalists’ syndicate called Barrack’s comments “a direct insult” that set “a serious and totally unacceptable precedent”. A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed an unprecedented lawsuit filed by the Trump administration earlier in the summer against all 15 judges serving on Maryland’s federal district court – a case that opposed pausing some deportations from the state. In a 37-page ruling, US district judge Thomas Cullen of Virginia’s western district – who was nominated and confirmed to his position during Donald Trump’s first presidency – wrote that “any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss”. “To hold otherwise,” Cullen added, “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.” The Trump administration had challenged an order issued by Maryland’s chief district judge that temporarily barred the government from deporting undocumented immigrants for two business days if they filed challenges to their detention. Trump’s justice department argued that the order exceeded the court’s authority and violated federal law. But Cullen, who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2020 and was assigned the case because all Maryland district judges were named as defendants, wrote that the judges were “absolutely immune” from lawsuits over their judicial actions. And Cullen said that instead of suing, the administration should have challenged the order though other legal channels, such as appealing against the order. Texas’s redrawn congressional maps have drawn a lawsuit from the NAACP, which accuses the state of committing a racial gerrymander with its maps that strip Black voters of their political power. The lawsuit, joined by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, names Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, and secretary of state, Jane Nelson, as defendants. It asks a federal judge for a preliminary injunction preventing the use of the redrawn maps, arguing that the redistricting violates the US constitution by improperly reducing the power of voters of color. It also argues that the maps violate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “We now see just how far extremist leaders are willing to go to push African Americans back toward a time when we were denied full personhood and equal rights,” the president of the Texas NAACP, Gary Bledsoe, said in a statement. “We call on Texans of every background to recognize the dangers of this moment. Our democracy depends on ensuring that every person is counted fully, valued equally and represented fairly. We are prepared to fight this injustice at every level. Our future depends on it.” Texas Republicans passed a redrawn map on Saturday, with the expected result of an increase in Republican representation by five seats in the next Congress. Democratic state legislators are a minority in both chambers of the Texas legislature, leaving them with few options to block it. A group of state house representatives spent nearly a month away from the state to deny Republicans a quorum. That maneuver ended last week, after California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and the state legislature began a process to counter the Republican gerrymander with a Democratic gerrymander of their own. Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in federal funding to the Ivy League university. “Don’t negotiate with them, they’ve been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in a cabinet meeting. Trump’s comments came amid reports that his administration and Harvard are moving toward a potential settlement that could bring an end to their months-long battle over the government’s allegations that Harvard has not done enough to crack down on antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests. In April, Harvard became the first – and so far only – university to sue the Trump administration over the funding cuts. It sued again the following month over the government’s efforts to block the school from enrolling international students. Harvard has argued that the administration unlawfully slashed $2.6bn in research funding from the university in retaliation for the school’s refusal to comply with a series of demands laid out in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism taskforce. Those demands related to campus protests, academic policies and admissions practices. A US district judge heard arguments from both Harvard and the Department of Justice last month. The Trump administration is cancelling another $175m in funding for California’s high-speed rail, marking another setback for the state’s much-delayed project. The US transportation department said on Tuesday it was withdrawing $175m for grade separation, over-crossing and design work and to build a high-speed rail station in Madera. The move follows the cancellation earlier this summer of $4bn in federal grants for the state’s ambitious but long-overdue plans. California in July sued to challenge the withdrawal of funding, calling the decision illegal. The funding cuts are another hurdle for the 16-year effort to link Los Angeles and San Francisco by a three-hour train ride, a project that would deliver the fastest passenger rail service in the United States. The rail system, whose first $10bn bond issue was approved by California voters in 2008, has built more than 50 major railway structures, including bridges, overpasses, under-crossings and viaducts, and completed 70 miles (113km) of guideway. The project has also faced numerous delays and spiraling costs, with no section of the railway currently operational and a completion date still years away. The San Francisco-to-Los Angeles route was initially supposed to be finished by 2020 at a cost of $33bn; the projected cost has since risen from $89bn to $128bn, with the start of service along a portion of the line in the Central valley only expected by 2033. On Monday, state lawmakers suggested the project would require a $1bn-per-year investment to continue in light of the federal funding cuts. US Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook’s lawsuit against Donald Trump could be filed as soon as today, CNBC reported on Wednesday citing sources. More to follow on this as we get it. The US transportation department said Wednesday it plans to reclaim management of Washington DC’s Union Station. In March, the White House forced Stephen Gardner, the CEO of US passenger railroad company Amtrak, to step down after president Donald Trump sought the changes. Trump this month deployed hundreds of national guard troops to Washington. Most Americans support a bid to sanction Russia’s trading partners as a way to put pressure on Moscow to end its war with Ukraine, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. The three-day poll, which concluded on Sunday, showed 62% of respondents back sanctioning Russia’s trading partners, a strategy that US president Donald Trump has partially embraced and has threatened to expand to include China. Trump has in recent weeks engaged in intense diplomacy, meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin in Alaska but so far failing to stop the conflict, a goal he had pledged to accomplish on his first day in office. India is hopeful that the US will review the additional 25% tariff imposed on Indian goods as penalty for its Russian oil purchases, a government source told reporters on Wednesday. The Indian government is holding talks with exporters to increase shipments of textiles, leather, gems and jewellery to other countries, and is likely to provide financial assistance to affected businesses, the source said. The US Transportation Department said Tuesday it will withhold federal funding from California, Washington State, and New Mexico unless they adopt English proficiency requirements for commercial truck drivers. The administration of president Donald Trump has taken a series of steps to address concerns about foreign truck drivers who do not speak English, and last week secretary of state Marco Rubio said the United States was immediately pausing the issuance of all worker visas for commercial truck drivers. In April, Trump signed an executive order directing enforcement of a rule requiring commercial drivers in the US to meet English proficiency standards. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the department could withhold about $50 million in federal funding if the states do not comply in 30 days and could take further action. Washington State said its state patrol was currently reviewing the matter with its state transportation partners and will have a detailed response soon. New Mexico’s transportation department did not immediately respond, Reuters reported. The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing next week to consider president Donald Trump’s nomination of White House economic adviser Stephen Miran as a Federal Reserve governor, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday evening, according to documents reviewed by the Associated Press. More than 180 current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished. Thirty-five signed their names while 141 signed anonymously for fear of retribution. The Associated Press has confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices Tuesday evening informing them they would be placed on leave indefinitely, with pay and that they must still check in every morning confirming their availability. It was unclear what the status was for other signatories. The notice said the decision “is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.” President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that US colleges would struggle without Chinese students, amid a backlash from his base after he suggested he could let 600,000 Chinese college students into the country as part of trade talks with the economic rival. Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said on Wednesday that the ministry hoped the US would follow through on Trump’s statement welcoming Chinese students and stop the “unprovoked harassment, interrogation, and deportation” of Chinese students. Denmark’s foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen over Danish intelligence reports that US citizens have been conducting covert influence operations in Greenland, the ministry said on Wednesday. Public broadcaster DR cited unnamed sources as saying the government believed at least three US nationals with ties to president Donald Trump’s administration had been involved in influence operations aimed at promoting Greenland’s secession from Denmark to the United States. “We are aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark,” foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement. “It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the Kingdom in the time ahead,” Rasmussen said. Neither the broadcaster nor the ministry named the individuals flagged in the intelligence reports. The US embassy in Copenhagen did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. The European Union is aiming to expedite legislation to remove all tariffs on US industrial goods by the end of the week, a demand made by president Donald Trump before the US will lower its duties on the bloc’s automobile exports, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on goods from India to as much as 50% took effect as scheduled on Wednesday, escalating tensions between the world’s two largest democracies and strategic partners. A punitive 25% tariff imposed due to India’s purchases of Russian oil adds to Trump’s prior 25% tariff on many products from India. It takes total duties to as high as 50% for goods such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals – among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and China. India and the US have held five rounds of discussions since April to reach a trade agreement, but differences over the opening up of India’s vast farm and dairy sectors, and its purchases of Russian oil led to a breakdown of talks. The new tariffs threaten thousands of small exporters and jobs, including in prime minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat, Reuters reported. An Indian commerce ministry official said on condition of anonymity that exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East. In other developments: Donald Trump held a televised, three-hour cabinet meeting, in which various secretaries seemed to compete to praise him in more effusive terms, and he took questions from reporters from partisan outlets. Trump told reporters that “I think, maybe in my own mind, I have somebody that I like” to take the place of the Federal Reserve governor he is trying to force out, Lisa Cook, who is fighting to keep her place. Two reporters for pro-Trump outlets offered testimony about crime in Washington DC to support the president’s claims. Texas’s redrawn congressional maps have drawn a lawsuit from the NAACP, accusing the state of committing a racial gerrymander with its maps that strip Black voters of their political power. A whistleblower complaint alleges that Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) copied and uploaded the sensitive Social Security data of hundreds of millions of Americans to a vulnerable cloud server, potentially violating federal privacy laws. One of the Doge staffers accused in the complaint is Edward Coristine, whose recent assault in Washington DC provided the pretext for Trump’s federal takeover. In a deeply partisan press release, Sean Duffy, the former Republican congressman and Fox host serving as Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, announced the cancellation of $175m in funding for four projects related to what he called “California’s High-Speed Rail boondoggle”. The Trump administration retaliated against some Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers who signed a letter of dissent about the agency’s leadership, the Washington Post reports. A local television outlet in Washington DC recorded video of “a full busload of National Guard members … picking up trash in Lafayette Park, just outside the White House”. Cracker Barrel announced that it is scrapping its new logo, and returning to its old one, hours after Donald Trump joined the conservative backlash to the change.

37) Chelsea close in on deal for Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     Chelsea are close to an agreement to sign Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho in a deal likely to be worth between £35m and £40m. Talks are yet to conclude but there is an expectation United will lower their £50m asking price and reach a compromise that will allow the winger to move to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea are waiting to hear back from United and are confident the deal will go ahead. Garnacho has no future under Ruben Amorim but Chelsea regard the Argentinian as a top talent and believe they can get his career back on track. It is understood Chelsea are confident they will not have to wait for the proposed sales of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson to go through before completing a move for Garnacho. Chelsea need to meet the terms of a Uefa settlement agreement stipulating they must have a “positive transfer balance” to register new players for the Champions League. The club are relaxed about the situation, however, with sources at Stamford Bridge stressing that suggestions they are under pressure to raise funds have been exaggerated. The desire to bring in another winger means Garnacho is viewed as a bigger priority than the RB Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons, who has emerged as a target for Tottenham. Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, uses a system that depends heavily on players staying wide and stretching the play. Chelsea want four wingers and see Garnacho competing with Jamie Gittens for a spot on the left. Garnacho fell out of favour last season and has faced questions over his attitude. Yet his talent is not in doubt – he played a crucial role in United beating Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024 – and Chelsea have done extensive background checks on his character. Chelsea believe that Garnacho will thrive in a different environment. Maresca wants plenty of depth in attack and has signed Liam Delap, João Pedro, Gittens and Estêvão Willian. Chelsea hold an interest in Fermín López but Barcelona do not want to sell the attacking midfielder. López could be an alternative to Simons. Chelsea are confident they will sell Nkunku and Jackson. Nkunku has interest from leading European sides, as does Jackson, a target for Aston Villa, Bayern Munich, Newcastle, Juventus and Napoli. Bayern are interested in a loan for Jackson, something Chelsea will only agree to if there is an obligation to buy. Roma, Leizpig and teams in England are interested in the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George. Chelsea are still waiting for firm interest to materialise in Raheem Sterling. Fulham are a possible destination for Sterling.

38) Denmark issues first apology over forced contraception of Greenlandic women — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has apologised for the first time for the forced contraception scandal in which thousands of Greenlandic girls and women were fitted with contraceptive coils without their permission or knowledge. Describing it as “systemic discrimination” against women and girls by the Danish healthcare system, Frederiksen said that because they were Greenlandic they were subjected to “both physical and psychological harm”. Some of the women were as young as 12 when they say they were fitted with an intrauterine device (IUD) by Danish doctors in an attempt to reduce the population of Greenland, which until 1953 was a Danish colony and only gained control of its own healthcare system in 1992. It is believed that 4,500 women and girls were affected between 1966 and 1970. Greenland’s former prime minister, Múte B Egede, has described the IUD scandal as a “genocide”. Denmark’s apology for cases up to 1992 – made in a joint statement with the Greenland prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who apologised for cases after that date – comes ahead of the publication of a long-awaited investigation into the IUD case, which is expected to be published in September. Separately, 143 Greenlandic women last year sued the Danish state for 43m Danish kroner, alleging they were fitted with the contraceptive coil without their consent or knowledge in what they describe as a violation of their human rights. Frederiksen said: “Even though we do not have the full picture, it makes a great impression on the government that so many Greenlandic women unanimously report that they have been subjected to abuse by the Danish healthcare system. “We cannot change what has happened. But we can take responsibility. Therefore, on behalf of Denmark, I would like to say: Sorry.” She added: “I apologise to the girls and women who have been subjected to systemic discrimination. Because they are Greenlanders. For experiencing both physical and psychological harm. For being let down.” Nielsen said that on behalf of his government he apologised “for the harm and abuse that may have been inflicted on several women after we took over responsibility for our healthcare system.” His government, he said, has been working on a compensation scheme for the affected women since January and an announcement on how to apply will be made soon. Naaja H Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for justice and gender equality, said: “An apology is only fitting and I believe it was unavoidable in order to move forward on a path of healing. So I am very pleased by the apology but I also couldn’t see any way around it. “The apology is directed at the girls and women who were on the receiving end of an unacceptable practice with a clear colonialist profile. I also believe a compensation is in place from the danish state.” Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament for the Greenlandic party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), said she was elated by the outcome, which she has been campaigning for for a long time. “An apology is important for a renewed relation between Greenland and Denmark,” she said. “What a joy.” Bula Larsen, one of the group of women who have sued the government for their historic mistreatment, said she was “very pleased” to finally receive an apology. “It gives me peace in my mind to finally close this dark chapter in my life,” she told the Guardian. Larsen, who is now 66, was 14 when she was told by the head of her dorm in Paamiut, Greenland, to go to the hospital without explanation. She has told how she remembers the shock and “tremendous pain” when a doctor forcibly fitted her with an IUD. The experience, she has previously said, felt like an assault. The pain was such that afterwards she said it felt as if she had “shattered glass in my abdomen”. As an adult, after she got married and tried to get pregnant, she found out she had been left sterile by the procedure. But some questioned the timing of her apology, which came hours after Denmark summoned the US charge d’affaires for an urgent meeting over an alleged influence campaign in Greenland aimed at shaping public opinion and the future of the Arctic territory. The government has previously said it will wait until the outcome of the investigation before it issued an apology. But Denmark, Frederiksen said on Wednesday, recognises that the case is “a source of both anger and sadness for many Greenlanders and many families in Greenland. And it naturally has an impact on the perception of Denmark and the realm.” The government expects to receive the findings of the investigation into the scandal soon, she said, after which the governments of Denmark and Greenland will work together to “learn from and deal with the concrete consequences of the dark chapters in our shared history”. She said this would also cover “possible financial compensation” for victims of the IUD scandal and “other specific cases”. She said: “This is very important work. We must become more knowledgable about our common past. Not because we can change it. But because we must acknowledge it. And learn from it.” She also referred to “other dark chapters that deal with systemic discrimination against Greenlanders. Because they were Greenlanders” from Denmark’s colonial past. “My apology on behalf of Denmark is also an apology for these other failures for which Denmark is responsible,” she added. “Where Greenlanders have been systemically treated differently and inferiorly than other citizens of the kingdom.” There is also an expert group that has been requested by the government of Greenland to look into possible human rights violations in connection to the IUD scandal. This is due to be finalised in January.

39) Denmark summons US diplomat over alleged Greenland influence campaign — The Guardian (2025-08-27)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/denmark-summons-us-diplomat-over-alleged-greenland-influence-campaign
   Text:
     Denmark has summoned the US charge d’affaires for an urgent meeting over an alleged influence campaign in Greenland aimed at shaping public opinion and the future of the Arctic territory. It comes after reports from Danish media, confirmed by the Danish foreign office, that at least three US men with ties to Donald Trump and the White House had been accused of trying to infiltrate Greenlandic society. Their activity – which, according to the broadcaster DR, includes compiling lists of Trump-supporting Greenlandic citizens – is being closely watched by the Danish government, which is understood to be aware of “foreign agents and actors” trying to shape public opinion in Greenland. The Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, denounced the alleged scheme on Wednesday, saying it was “totally unacceptable”. He said: “It is important that we gain insight into this so that our populations – this applies to both Greenland and Denmark – can see what it is we are up against.” Rasmussen said officials would make it “very clear to the US” that a foreign influence campaign in Greenland with Washington’s backing would be contrary to all international rules. Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said she was taking the claims “very seriously”. “Any interference in internal affairs in the kingdom of Denmark, and Greenlandic democracy, is unacceptable,” she said. “I note that the Americans do not clearly deny that the situation is as DR presents today. And that is of course serious.” Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to acquire Greenland since taking office, driving tensions between Denmark and the US to unprecedented levels. The former Danish colony is part of the kingdom of Denmark, although it is now autonomous with the exception of its foreign and security policy, which remains controlled by Copenhagen. In an unusual move aimed at highlighting the gravity of the situation, Denmark’s highest-ranking civil servant will attend the meeting. The charge d’affaires was summoned in the absence of Trump’s incoming US ambassador, Ken Howery, who is yet to be confirmed by the US Senate. A date for his arrival in Copenhagen is yet to be confirmed but Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, a friend of Elon Musk and the ambassador to Sweden under Trump’s first administration, is expected in the Danish capital in October. According to DR, the three unnamed American men are accused of attempting to permeate Greenlandic society to weaken relations with Denmark through what it described as “infiltration” and “influence operations”. One of them, who it is claimed compiled a list of Trump supporters, has reportedly appeared in public with Trump numerous times. He is also accused of creating a list of those who do not support the US president and of advising on issues that “put Denmark in a bad light” in the US media. These allegedly include the forced removals of Greenlandic children by Danish authorities and a separate scandal over the forced contraception of Greenlandic women, for which Frederiksen issued a long-awaited apology on Wednesday. The two other American men whose activities have reportedly caused Danish authorities concern previously worked under Trump and are known to travel frequently to Greenland from the US. A government source said that with the population of the capital, Nuuk, being about 20,000 people, “it’s pretty obvious who is walking around and doing this”. A number of high-profile Americans with political connections and business people have flocked to Nuuk since Trump’s election. In January, Donald Trump Jr was joined by the political activist Charlie Kirk, who cofounded the pro-Trump conservative organisation Turning Point USA. In March, before Greenland’s election, Drew Horn, a member of the first Trump administration and the chief executive of the Washington DC-based mineral investment company GreenMet, said there were “tens of billions” of dollars ready to be invested in Greenland immediately. Tom Dans, Trump’s former Arctic commissioner and an investor, described Greenland as “really frontier in the true sense of things”. None of the men have been implicated by Danish authorities. Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, said she did not know of any “shady activities” taking place in Greenland. She told newspaper Sermitsiaq: “There is nothing new in what I have been presented with, beyond what we already know.” Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament for the Greenlandic party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), said the latest reports reflected a US effort. “We have seen before that they have been trying to influence the people of Greenland, but of course also Greenlandic politicians. This is just a continuation of that.” But she said she had not seen evidence of an impact on people’s views. “I don’t think it is working. The Greenlandic people have been an object for people trying to influence us over many many years.” She said life for the Greenlandic people continued to be worse than for Danish people living in the Danish kingdom, especially as a result of underinvestment and the historic injustices against Inuit people. Although she said the US remained “on the table” when it came to investment in Greenland, the impact of Trump’s words about acquiring Greenland – by force if required – had had an impact. Greenland, she said, was “much more sceptical towards the US than before”. Pele Broberg, who leads Greenland’s opposition party, Naleraq, which is seen as the most Trump-friendly of Greenland’s political parties, said he was baffled by the diplomatic clash, saying the claims were based on previously reported events from January. “Should we never talk to anybody but Denmark? We don’t get what the big issue is right now,” he said. He denied claims that the White House was trying to influence opinions in Nuuk, adding: “But what I do know is that the Danish, French and German governments are trying to influence the Greenlandic government every single day … It’s just business as usual.” This is the second time Denmark has summoned the US charge d’affaires since Trump assumed office. The first such meeting, in May, was over reports that US intelligence agencies had been ordered to increase espionage in Greenland. The US Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative of the US government said in a statement to DR: “Individual US citizens may have interests in Greenland. The US government does not control or direct the actions of private citizens.” They said the US “values the relationships with the governments of Greenland and Denmark,” adding: “The president, vice-president and secretary of state have all been clear: the United States respects the right of the Greenlandic people to determine their own future.” Speaking on behalf of Horn, Sabrina Katz, vice-president of operations and Arctic lead at GreenMet, said: “Drew is no longer affiliated with the Trump administration and is now fully focused on private sector work. Our efforts in Greenland are solely driven by commercialisation objectives and are not connected to any government role or agenda.” Dans is understood to deny any part in the reported influence operation

40) UK politics: Tories and Reform offer only ‘easy answers and snake oil’ on UK-EU relationship, minister warns – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-27)

     This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates and commenting below the line. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: The Tories and Reform UK only offer “easy answers and snake oil” when it comes to the UK’s relationship with the European Union, Nick Thomas-Symonds has said. In a speech hosted by the Spectator magazine, the EU relations minister said: “Some will hysterically cry even treason. Some will say we’re surrendering sovereignty or freedoms, but that is nonsense.” Thomas-Symonds also accused Farage of “dividing communities and stoking anger”. He dismissed Reform UK’s proposal to negotiate returns agreements with states such as Iran and renegotiate the Good Friday agreement, saying Nigel Farage was struggling to control his own parliamentary party. Farage has rolled back on his pledge to deport “absolutely anyone” arriving in the UK on small boats just 24 hours after making it at a combative press conference in Oxford that led to accusations of ugly and destructive rhetoric. Farage announced plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in the first five years of a Reform government and to pay despotic regimes such as the Taliban to take them back. He also said: “Yes, women and children, everybody on arrival, will be detained.” At a press conference near Edinburgh on Wednesday, however, when asked whether his comments on securing women’s safety in the UK rang hollow when he had committed to deporting women and girls back to countries where they faced oppression and sexual violence, Farage said that was not true. Asked if that meant women and children were exempt from the plans, he said: “I didn’t say exempt for ever, but at this stage it is not part of our plan for the next five years.” Farage similarly rowed back on his proposal to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement after political parties in Northern Ireland condemned his comment as reckless and irresponsible. He said “the Northern Ireland situation is deeply complex” and “that will not be at the forefront of what we do”. Claire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) leader, said on Wednesday that Farage’s plan to withdraw the UK from the European convention on human rights would remove a pillar of the Good Friday agreement. Hanna said: “The agreement belongs to the people of this island. It is not Nigel Farage’s to tear up, nor any other British politician’s.” The Alliance party and SDLP have echoed Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, in saying that any attempt to unpick the 1998 peace agreement could destabilise the region. Farage spoke in Scotland on Wednesday to announce the MSP Graham Simpson as the latest defection from the Scottish Conservatives to Reform UK. Simpson becomes Reform’s sole MSP sitting in the Scottish parliament, and its second MSP overall after the former Tory Michelle Ballantyne’s defection in the last parliamentary session. Simpson said he decided to join Reform UK to “create something new, exciting and lasting” and appealed to former colleagues, saying “I say to those who have great ideas for Scotland and who may have felt ignored: ‘Talk to me, you will find my door – wherever I am put in parliament next week – open and receptive to the kind of fresh thinking that we need in politics.’” He added he thought Reform could “help” to remove the SNP from office after 19 years in power. The Conservatives could “potentially” strike a deal with Afghanistan over migration, the party’s chair has said. Asked directly if the Tories would set up a returns agreement with the Taliban-run country, Kevin Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Well, potentially, yes.” However, Hollinrake later told Sky News such a deal would be “very expensive” and have “very significant” human rights consequences. Hollinrake added that his party’s Rwanda deportation plan, which was published in May, is “far more comprehensive than the one we’ve seen from Reform, in that it dealt with both legal migration and illegal migration”. Farage has been called “one of the most disastrous politicians” and “extraordinarily damaging” by the SNP after the Reform UK leader outlined his plans to curb migration. SNP MP Stephen Gethins, the SNP foreign affairs spokesperson at Westminster, questioned parts of the policy – which could see a future UK government potentially work with the Taliban to send people back to Afghanistan, with the UK also leaving the European convention on human rights. Reform councillor Ross Lambie defended the party’s immigration policy. The UK has had reassurance from France that the deal between the two countries to allow small boat interceptions in the English Channel “will go ahead”, Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said. He told Times Radio: “The Home Office have already set out that they’ve had reassurance from the French interior ministry that this change in maritime law will go ahead.” Talks on a food and drink deal with the EU will begin in the autumn, with MPs having the final say on any agreement, the minister in charge of negotiations with the bloc has said. Thomas-Symonds told an event hosted by the Spectator magazine on Wednesday: “This autumn, we will start the detailed negotiations on the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary standards) deal, as well as other commitments from our summit last May.” Earlier, it had been reported that UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU – costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027. Thomas-Symonds enthused about how excited he is by the prospect of an EU youth mobility scheme, as he signalled a broader government shift towards embracing closer ties with the bloc. Thomas-Symonds said on Wednesday he was looking forward to signing a deal to let young people travel and work more freely across Europe. Refugee charities warn that thousands of people in the UK could find themselves homeless on the streets this winter after the Home Office quietly reverse its asylum accommodation policy. The Guardian has learned that ministers are planning to halve the period asylum seekers are given to find new accommodation after getting a decision on their case, from 56 to 28 days. Refugee organisations say this is not enough time to find work and a home to rent and will lead to many people pitching tents in the streets. Energy costs will rise for millions of British households this autumn after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill increased by 2% to £1,755. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, will raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of just over £35 a year for the average home, following a rise in European gas prices. Labour responded by saying its plan for change will protect consumers, but the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said the government should cancel the rise and take up his party’s plan “to halve energy bills instead”. Plaid Cymru called for the government to “tax the super rich and lower bills for our communities”. Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told Sky News that the government’s increase in the warm home discount would help some of the lowest income households in the country and see them receive an additional £150 towards their energy. The cost of UK government borrowing has jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Rachel Reeves to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%. Patrick Harvie has urged Scottish Green members to back whoever is elected to the leadership on Friday as he steps down. The MSP announced earlier this year he would be stepping away from heading up the party after 17 years, but plans to continue as an MSP. The UK government sold £5bn worth in three-year bonds in a scheduled action on Wednesday. Demand was good, with the auction covered 3.16 times. The bonds were sold with a yield of 4.375%, due in 2028. Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel’s approval. It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK’s leading universities. Thames Water has agreed a payment plan with the water regulator for fines it owes worth £123m, as it races to secure funding to avoid temporary nationalisation. The water company, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, is trying to pull together a deal to avoid collapse. Inequality in transport emissions between the richest and the poorest in the UK is set to widen dramatically over the next decade, an analysis has found. The most affluent and mobile already produce 10 times more carbon through their domestic travel than the poorest and least mobile. Under current decarbonisation policies, thinktank researchers forecast this to grow to 13 times by 2035. But revised policies that tackle domestic flying and excess private car use could not only lessen inequality, they say, but also reduce emissions faster overall. Inequality in transport emissions between the richest and the poorest in the UK is set to widen dramatically over the next decade, an analysis has found. The most affluent and mobile already produce 10 times more carbon through their domestic travel than the poorest and least mobile. Under current decarbonisation policies, thinktank researchers forecast this to grow to 13 times by 2035. But revised policies that tackle domestic flying and excess private car use could not only lessen inequality, they say, but also reduce emissions faster overall. “Fairness isn’t a barrier to climate action – it’s the key to unlocking it,” said Stephen Frost, the head of transport policy at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). “A fairer approach doesn’t just cut carbon faster, it builds a healthier, more inclusive transport system for everyone.” The IPPR research updates a study last year that broke down transport emissions by income, gender, location, ethnicity and age, finding that wealthy white men from rural areas are the country’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. They found there was a stark divide in people’s experience of getting around, with some having effectively unlimited ability to travel how, when and where they like, while millions of others are unable to access community life or jobs. In the current research, they used the same 12 traveller profiles on which the original study was based, ranging from the most to least affluent and mobile, and projected their decrease in transport emissions over the next decade according to the government’s current policies. They found that the poorest groups were due to decarbonise much faster than the wealthiest, with the richest 4% set to emit 13 times more carbon from their domestic travel than the poorest 14% by 2035 – up from a tenfold gap today. When international travel was included, the richest were expected to emit 22 times more than the poorest – up from 20 times today. Transport is the highest emitting sector in the UK and almost 30% of emission savings will potentially come from surface transport between now and 2030. The government’s approach to decarbonising the sector focuses heavily on the adoption of climate technologies, such as zero-emission vehicles and sustainable aviation fuels, with limited policies focusing on demand reduction. The UK government has just sold £5bn worth in three-year bonds in a scheduled action. Demand was good, with the auction covered 3.16 times. The bonds were sold with a yield of 4.375%, due in 2028. The gilt market has been rocky lately, with yield on the 30-year bond trading close to its highest level since 1998 yesterday, at 5.62%. Yields rise when prices fall. The yield on the 30-year rose to as high as 5.627% in early trading this morning, but it has since recovered, with the yield now at 5.583%. Mohit Kumar, an analyst at the investment broker Jefferies, paints a gloomy picture of the UK’s economic outlook: We have held a negative view on the UK fiscal picture and maintain the view. We see UK growth disappointing relative to official forecasts which would leave the Chancellor with a bigger budget hole than current official forecast suggests. Tax rises look inevitable in the Autumn statement. However, we are approaching levels where further tax rises start becoming counterproductive. Nigel Farage has sought to clarify Reform UK’s deportation policy, saying single women will be removed from the country if the party comes to power. According to the PA news agency, the Reform leader told broadcasters: There’s slight confusion here. Deporting children is a very difficult thing to do. Who do they go to, what are the wards of care. Women and children, intimating families that have been here illegally for some years, are they top of our list? No. So, there’s a slight confusion over this, and I think maybe in the press conference I didn’t quite understand the context of what Richard Tice was saying. Asked whether women would be deported, he said: If a single woman etc comes to Britain, they will be detained and deported. If a woman comes with children, we will work out the best thing to do. He added that the “big message” was that the “vast majority of those that come are young males” and they “will not be staying” in the UK. Plaid Cymru have called for the government to “tax the super rich and lower bills for our communities”, in response to the news that Ofgem will raise the government’s cap on energy bills by 2% from October. In a social media post on X, alongside a screenshot of a Sky News headline about the energy bill rise, the party wrote: When it suited them, Labour called for a freeze on energy prices. Now they’re in power, bills are rising again – and Welsh families are paying the price. A fairer system is possible: tax the super-rich, and lower bills for our communities! Patrick Harvie has urged Scottish Green members to back whoever is elected to the leadership on Friday as he steps down, reports the PA news agency. The MSP announced earlier this year he would be stepping away from heading up the party after 17 years, but plans to continue as an MSP. His fellow co-leader Lorna Slater is seeking to keep her job, facing a challenge from fellow MSP Gillian Mackay, while Ross Greer is seeking to replace Harvie as part of top team against Edinburgh-based activist Dominic Ashmole. In a statement released ahead of the announcement of the result on Friday, Harvie stressed the need for Green voices in Scottish politics as he urged the party to back whoever is victorious. He said: With a new leadership team taking office on Friday it will be the start of a new chapter for our party. Regardless of who wins, my role will be changing and I’m looking forward to being a loyal lieutenant for whoever they are. The polls look very positive for our prospects to elect a record number of Greens MSPs in 2026 and if the party works hard and supports the new leadership team, we can continue to change Scotland for the better. Green ideas are more necessary than ever. Our world is on fire, our economic system is broken and the far right are on the rise. Green voices are absolutely vital if we are to protect people and planet, and secure a fairer, greener and better future. Harvie was elected as an MSP in 2003 and became co-leader of the party in 2008, when the Greens were “very different”, he said. Harvie added: It has been humbling and inspiring to have played such a frontline role as we have grown across every part of Scotland. At the time I took office it wasn’t just climate deniers and the political right who wrote us off. Lots of people who had sympathy for what we stand for hadn’t yet been persuaded we could make a difference. But we got stuck in and we delivered Green change, from higher taxes on the wealthy to ending peak rail fares and establishing free bus travel for young people. It is because of this record that we have firmly established ourselves as a bold and radical force in Scottish politics. He steps down as one of just two Green MSPs – along with Slater – to ever hold ministerial office, having been appointed by Nicola Sturgeon in 2021 after the signing of the Bute House agreement, which secured the backing of the party’s MSPs for major SNP legislation. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has accused pharmaceutical companies of being “shortsighted” and undermining their relationships with the government after the two sides failed to come to an agreement last week, but what is the row all about? The Guardian’s UK technology editor, Robert Booth, has written this explainer: Keir Starmer’s lead negotiator on Europe has enthused about how excited he is by the prospect of an EU youth mobility scheme, as he signalled a broader government shift towards embracing closer ties with the bloc. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of negotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU, said on Wednesday he was looking forward to signing a deal to let young people travel and work more freely across Europe. His tone contrasted with that struck just a few months ago, when the government would not even say whether it was willing to enter negotiations over such a scheme. He made the comments during a speech in which he promised to agree a new agricultural export deal by the start of 2027, as ministers begin to talk more openly about their desire to move closer to Brussels. Nigel Farage has said that even Keir Starmer “hasn’t attacked me” over his controversial and “uncosted, undeliverable” plan to tackle illegal immigration, one day after Reform UK announced their policies. The Reform leader told a press conference in Scotland on Wednesday: I think what’s really interesting is people aren’t questioning the need for something radical to be done. Even the prime minister hasn’t attacked me on the idea that we should be deporting people that come illegally. But he hasn’t got the means to do it, the Tories didn’t have the means to do it. We are proposing the means to do it. However, Home Office minister Lord Hanson told LBC that the Reform UK plans are “uncosted, unconstructed” and “won’t be very effective”. “Nigel Farage’s plan, such as it is, could have been written on the back of a fag packet, is very uncosted and unconstructed, and it’s not really going to be very effective and it’s not really a plan that is deliverable,” he said. The veteran politician, who has served under Blair and Brown’s governments, added: To deliver something, you need to have a proper, effective plan. And what we’re trying to do in government, difficult and challenging though it is, is to make some inroads into some of the real challenges and real issues without … promising undeliverable plans. Wes Streeting gets top marks for fighting talk in his battle with the pharmaceutical companies over the price of prescription medicines. After the health secretary walked away from talks with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) on Friday, he stuck the boot in. The “shortsighted” pharma industry had rejected “a serious and generous” offer, he said. It should be more “collaborative” instead of making “unaffordable” demands. The government could not allow British patients and taxpayers to be ripped off. Yet Streeting surely also knows this standoff cannot be allowed to last indefinitely. Portraying the pharma companies as greedy may be good political theatre – and, since we are talking about some of the world’s biggest and richest corporations, the sentiment is hardly controversial. But at the end of this process the government still needs a deal. If not, its boasts about making the UK a life sciences “superpower” will ring hollow. And the cold reality, unfortunately, is that Streeting is negotiating with global companies that also have reasons to play hard. Nigel Farage said deporting women and children was not part of Reform UK’s plans “for the next five years”, a day after he announced proposals to remove up to 600,000 people from the UK. He told a press conference in Scotland on Wednesday: I was very, very clear yesterday in what I said, that deportation of illegal immigrants – we are not even discussing women and children at this stage – there are so many illegal males in Britain, and the news reports that said that after my conference yesterday were wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Asked whether women and children would be “exempt” from deportation, the Reform UK leader added: I didn’t say exempt forever, but at this stage it’s not part of our plan for the next five years. On Tuesday, senior Reform figure Zia Yusuf said “phase one” of the party’s plans would focus on adults, with unaccompanied children being removed “towards the latter half of that five years”. Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel’s approval. It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK’s leading universities. Chevening scholarships are largely government funded and are offered to “exceptional individuals” to study for a one-year master’s degree at a UK university. All 40 students identified by the government have fully funded scholarships. A Home Office source said it was “a complex and challenging task”. Names would have to be submitted to the Israeli authorities for approval, after which the students would travel to a third country, likely to be Jordan, for visa biometric checks, which are not currently available in Gaza. Campaigners for the students welcomed the news, but expressed concern that the latest group had received no direct contact from the government or been given details of what might happen next, while others with full funding appeared not to have been included. Dr Norah Parr, a researcher at the University of Birmingham who has been coordinating efforts to support the students, said: We are relieved that the government has agreed to assist a larger group of students and ensure their arrival to the UK for the start of their autumn term, but we remain concerned about a lack of transparency or clear guidelines. At our last count, at least 53 students had full funding and support from UK universities. There may be more we are not aware of. As it stands, the news is causing further concern and anxiety. Who will be included and by what parameters will inclusion be determined? Government data for the year ending June 2025 showed that 110,000 people received a decision on their asylum claim, with about half granted leave to remain. Refugee charities warn that thousands of people in the UK could find themselves homeless on the streets this winter after the Home Office quietly reverse its asylum accommodation policy. The Guardian has learned that ministers are planning to halve the period asylum seekers are given to find new accommodation after getting a decision on their case, from 56 to 28 days. Refugee organisations say this is not enough time to find work and a home to rent and will lead to many people pitching tents in the streets. The British Red Cross is among those raising concerns about an increase in rough sleeping among refugees and, along with other refugee NGOs, is calling on the government to rethink. Alex Fraser, the British Red Cross director of refugee services, said: Reducing the ‘move-on’ period will increase levels of homelessness and destitution for people granted protection and put additional pressure on local authorities. The numbers don’t add up. It takes around 35 days to receive universal credit. Local authorities need 56 days to work with households at risk of homelessness. Giving people only 28 days to find work, housing or support isn’t enough time. Making people destitute ends up costing the taxpayer more money and causing distress and hardship. We urge the government to review this decision. The government is grappling with a crisis over the use of hotels for asylum seekers, with dozens of protests staged by anti-migrant groups and individuals in recent weeks. Ministers are under pressure to expedite hotel closures and have committed to speeding up asylum decision-making, a decision welcomed by refugee organisations and by asylum seekers. But if there is not sufficient time for refugees to find work and accommodation, this could increase street homelessness. While Graham Simpson will be Reform UK’s sole MSP at Holyrood, he is not the party’s first MSP. Michelle Ballantyne sat as a Reform member at the Scottish parliament from January to May 2021, having left the Conservatives the previous year and sitting for a short spell as an independent. She lost her seat at the May 2021 election. Political parties in Northern Ireland have condemned Nigel Farage’s proposal to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement, calling it reckless and irresponsible. The Alliance party and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) echoed Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, in saying that any attempt to unpick the 1998 peace agreement could destabilise the region. Claire Hanna, the SDLP leader, on Wednesday that Farage’s plan to withdraw the UK from the European convention on human rights would remove a pillar of the Good Friday agreement. Hanna said: The agreement belongs to the people of this island. It is not Nigel Farage’s to tear up, nor any other British politician’s. Farage has never had any interest in Northern Ireland and when things get difficult, he will drop Northern Ireland in a heartbeat rather than spend years painstakingly negotiating with Dublin. However, Sammy Wilson, a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) MP, endorsed Farage’s proposal as a way to stem immigration and said Reform, with a big enough majority after the next election, could renegotiate the Good Friday agreement without much difficulty. Graham Simpson said he decided to join Reform UK to “create something new, exciting and lasting”. Speaking with party leader Nigel Farage by his side, the former Scottish Tory MSP said: I’ve joined Reform because we have the chance to create something new, exciting and lasting that puts the needs of people over the system, that asks what is going wrong how we can fix it. He added he thought Reform could “help” to remove the SNP from office after 19 years in power. According to the PA news agency, Simpson also said he would not step down from the central Scotland regional list at Holyrood after his defection. Simpson said he still has work to do as an MSP, including a members’ bill which would create a mechanism for sacking MSPs. Simpson also said he would seek to “develop a policy suite” which goes beyond Reform’s two key issues in Scotland of net zero and immigration. Addressing the decision to leave the party he joined at the age of 15, Simpson said it was a “wrench”. Speaking at the press conference in Broxburn, West Lothian, he said: It’s fair to say that some of you won’t be surprised to see me here, given that the Scottish Tories have been touting my name as a potential defector for months now. So today, I’m giving them what they want, but perhaps not for the reasons that they think. Leaving the party that I first joined when I was 15 is an enormous wrench, and I’ve been through a lot of soul searching in the past few weeks. However, Simpson said he had decided earlier this year not to stand again for the Scottish Tories, but it was not until the past few weeks he had chosen to move to Reform: I watched Reform with interest and I see the opportunity to help create something fresh here in Scotland, and it’s clear that the voters agree in increasing numbers. But just because a party is becoming popular isn’t a reason to join it, keeping your job in parliament isn’t a good enough reason either. Too many people feel let down and ignored, they feel the system is against them, that the traditional parties don’t even care about them. Save for some fine individual MSPs across parties, the political class is not serving the people well. Failure is accepted and change takes far too long. In an open call to his former Tory colleagues, Simpson said his door will be open to those with “great ideas for Scotland”. He said: I’ve no doubt that, initially, my announcement today will spark anger, disappointment and probably some sheer nastiness. I don’t like that aspect of politics and I’m not looking forward to it, but there are many ex-colleagues who will also understand. I say to those who have great ideas for Scotland and who may have felt ignored: talk to me, you will find my door – wherever I am put in parliament next week – open and receptive to the kind of fresh thinking that we need in politics. The cost of UK government borrowing has jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Rachel Reeves to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%. That pushed the UK’s long-term borrowing costs close to a spike in April of 5.66%, when 30-year bond yields reached their highest since 1998. UK borrowing costs have risen sharply in recent months, increasing the cost of financing UK government debt to more than £100bn a year – almost 10% of the annual budget. Economists have said the UK faces a unique strain on its financial position at a time when higher welfare and healthcare costs and rapid ageing are driving up the level of borrowing across most industrialised nations. Reeves is expected to be faced with a deficit of between £20bn and £40bn when she delivers the autumn budget. To maintain her fiscal rules and maintain the £10bn buffer in place under current plans, the chancellor will need to find between £30bn and £50bn in either extra taxes, reduced spending or higher borrowing. Higher borrowing bills and U-turns on proposed welfare cuts have heightened the expectation of increases in taxes later this year. Investors also fear the UK is suffering from high inflation that will persist for several years, devaluing their UK funds. Catherine Mann, a member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee, said UK policymakers were underestimating “inflation persistence”. She said: There is an increasing tension between inflation persistence and weak growth, the trade-off that we currently face in the United Kingdom. She said the Bank needed to maintain high interest rates to bring down inflation and then cut aggressively to revive the economy. Nigel Farage is speaking to reporters at a hotel near Edinburgh the day after he was accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after his announcement of plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from the UK. He has just announced the defection of Scottish Conservative MSP for central Scotland Graham Simpson to Reform. Simpson will be Reform’s sole MSP at Holyrood: Farage said he would be able to “show colleagues the ropes” at Holyrood at next May’s elections. Previously, Michelle Ballantyne sat as a Reform member at the Scottish parliament from January to May 2021, having left the Conservatives the previous year and sitting for a short spell as an independent. She lost her seat at the May 2021 election. Farage said that his press conference yesterday had “sparked the beginning of a national debate”, before introducing Simpson who said Reform represented “an opportunity to create something fresh” for voters. This is the third MSP to leave the Scottish Tories in recent months, the other two quitting for the Lib Dems and another to sit as an independent. UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU – costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027. Government figures released on Tuesday showed it issued 328,727 such licences last year, at a cost of between £113 and £200 each. That would put the total cost to business at somewhere between £37m and £65m. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of European negotiations, will on Wednesday pledge to eliminate such costs as he promises a new agreement with the EU in the next 18 months. In an event at the Spectator offices in London to be hosted by the leading Brexiter Michael Gove, Thomas-Symonds will make a vocally political argument for becoming closer to the EU. Ministers have decided in recent months their attempts to realign with Brussels enjoy more support than the approach of the Conservatives or Reform UK, which have promised to rip up Labour’s renegotiated deal. Thomas-Symonds will take specific aim at Farage, arguing: Nigel Farage’s manifesto at the next election will say in writing he wants to take Britain backwards, cutting at least £9bn from the economy, bringing with it a risk to jobs and a risk of food prices going up. A day after the Reform leader gave a speech warning that Britain was under threat from an “invasion” of asylum seekers, Thomas-Symonds will add: Nigel Farage wants Britain to fail. His model of politics feeds on it, offering the easy answers, dividing communities and stoking anger. Keir Starmer announced a new agreement with the EU in May, as part of which ministers agreed to pursue a series of specific deals, including one on food and agricultural products. The Tories and Reform UK only offer “easy answers and snake oil” when it comes to the UK’s relationship with the European Union, Nick Thomas-Symonds has said. In a speech hosted by the Spectator magazine, the EU relations minister said: Some will hysterically cry even treason. Some will say we’re surrendering sovereignty or freedoms, but that is nonsense. He added: Now, we know we are going to have a political fight on this, especially when we legislate for it in parliament. But the prime minister was very direct in his instructions to me on taking office – national interests first, build on what’s best about Britain. We are determined to plug the gaps, to rebuild Britain, protect our borders, bring down bills in every part of the country and secure good jobs, a new relationship of mutual benefit, one that brings freedom back to our businesses and exercises our sovereignty. And it needs pragmatism. When you’re tough, decisive and collaborative. That cannot rest on easy answers and snake oil. The Tories [are] completely 2D, stuck with a ghost of Brexit past. And then Nigel Farage, who has pledged to reverse our progress. Thomas-Symonds also accused Farage of “dividing communities and stoking anger”. He also dismissed Reform UK’s proposal to negotiate returns agreements with states such as Iran and renegotiate the Good Friday agreement, saying Farage was struggling to control his own parliamentary party. The Cabinet Office minister told an event in Westminster hosted by the Spectator magazine: I think that a careful, considered approach in Northern Ireland is absolutely critical. I think the Good Friday agreement is one of the great achievements of any peacetime UK government since 1945 and a comment like that just simply shows that Nigel Farage produces outlandish, unrealistic promises for solving problems and that, I’m afraid, is another one of them. He was talking as well, as far as I can make out, of negotiating with hostile regimes around the world. He’s struggling at the moment to negotiate the politics of a parliamentary party that fits in the back of a taxi. I don’t put too much confidence in them. Nigel Farage is about to hold a press conference in Scotland. You can watch it live here if you’d like: Talks on a food and drink deal with the EU will begin in the autumn, with MPs having the final say on any agreement, the minister in charge of negotiations with the bloc has said. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told an event hosted by the Spectator magazine on Wednesday: This autumn, we will start the detailed negotiations on the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary standards) deal, as well as other commitments from our summit last May. We will then bring the legislation to parliament to implement the deal. We will get that done by 2027, so businesses and consumers see the tangible impacts as soon as possible – money saved at the borders, profits freed up to invest, pounds kept in the pocket of working people. Earlier, Thomas-Symonds had insisted that the government’s approach would deliver “practical” benefits including lower prices, easier food exports for farmers and less time spent by truck drivers sitting in queues. Thames Water has said its fines would not be paid for out of customer bills (see 10.21am BST). According to the PA news agency, Thames Water said: The company continues to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led recapitalisation which delivers for customers and the environment as soon as practicable. Thames Water has agreed a payment plan with the water regulator for fines it owes worth £123m, as it races to secure funding to avoid temporary nationalisation. The water company, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, is trying to pull together a deal to avoid collapse. Earlier this month, the government approved the appointment of insolvency advisers FTI Consulting to consult on plans for Thames Water to be placed into a special administration regime. The debt-laden utility company was hit with a record £104m fine by Ofwat in May over environmental breaches involving sewage spills, after failing to operate and manage its treatment works and wastewater networks effectively. At the same time, a further £18.2m fine was levied on Thames for breaking dividend rules, the first penalty of its kind in the water industry. Ofwat said the company had paid out cash to investors despite having fallen short in its services to customers and its environmental record. The penalties were originally due to be paid by 20 August but the regulator has given the company some breathing space to pay the fines. Ofwat had previously told Thames that the penalties had to be “paid by the company and its investors, and not by customers”. The regulator has approved Thames’s request for a payment plan, which will result in it paying £24.5m, or 20% of the penalties, by the end of September, with the rest to be paid later. The company will pay the remainder on the earliest of three possible dates, which would be either 30 days after the implementation of a restructuring plan, or if Thames enters an SAR the balance would be due 30 days after the end of that process. The final deadline for payment of the fine will be 31 March 2030. Responding to Ofgem announcing that the energy price cap will rise by 2% (see 8.47am BST), Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: The last thing struggling families and pensioners need is higher energy bills this winter. The government should cancel this rise and take up our plan to halve energy bills instead. Ministers should be cutting bills by making sure energy firms pass on the benefits of cheap renewables, not putting up bills yet again. Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage would only make things even worse by shackling us to expensive, dirty fossil fuels, pushing us into the arms of Vladimir Putin. Nigel Farage has been called “one of the most disastrous politicians” and “extraordinarily damaging” by the SNP after the Reform UK leader outlined his plans to curb migration. SNP MP Stephen Gethins, the SNP foreign affairs spokesperson at Westminster, questioned parts of the policy – which could see a future UK government potentially work with the Taliban to send people back to Afghanistan, with the UK also leaving the European convention on human rights. He argued that Brexit – which Farage campaigned for – had “pushed up the small boats crisis” in the UK, as it means those seeking asylum are forced to do so in the first country they arrive in. Hitting out at the Reform UK leader, Gethins told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: He is the architect, along with people like Boris Johnson, and others of the small boats crisis. Now he wants to remove us from the European convention on human rights, which was the convention introduced at the end of the second world war to give us some of the most basic rights, like prohibition of torture and right to life and all these other basic things we take for granted. Reform on Tuesday said they would scale up detention capacity for asylum seekers to 24,000 and secure deals with countries such as Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran to return migrants. However Farage failed to answer when asked how much he would be prepared to pay Iran and the Taliban to take deportees back. Gethins insisted such policies show Farage “is an extraordinarily damaging politician”. The PA news agency reports that the Arbroath and Broughty Ferry MP continued: On Afghanistan, he now wants to do deals with the Taliban. Will that mean people who were abandoned in Kabul, who served alongside the British army … are they now going to be sent back to the Taliban, and are we going to be paying for the Taliban for the privilege of sending these people back? I think most people can see that doing a deal with the Taliban to send back women, human rights advocates and others who have campaigned against that brutal regime is unrealistic. I don’t think it is realistic, and I think any basic reading of this is unrealistic. That is why Nigel Farage is one of the most disastrous politicians. He is one of the most consequential, but not in a good way. But Reform councillor Ross Lambie defended the party’s immigration policy, saying: My view on it and Reform’s view on it is that largely, if not all, of those people crossing the Channel are bogus asylum seekers who are, at best they’re here to gain the benefits system of this country. At worst, they could be here to do us harm. He told BBC Radio Scotland that those coming to the UK in small boats are “not people fleeing” oppressive regimes and are “obscuring their identity”. Lambie said this involves either “hiding their past” or “actually hiding their true country of origin”. According to the PA news agency, his comments came after a poll, by the David Hume Institute and Diffley Partnership, found 21% of Scots think immigration is one of the top three issues in the country, up from 16% in May and just 4% in May 2023. It suggests that immigration is now seen as the third biggest priority for the country, with only health and the cost-of-living crisis regarded as more important by voters. While the Conservative party chair told Times Radio earlier that the party could “potentially” strike a deal with Taliban-run Afghanistan over migration (see 8.19am BST), Kevin Hollinrake later told Sky News such a deal would be “very expensive” and have “very significant” human rights consequences. According to the PA news agency, he added that the previous government’s proposal of deporting people to Rwanda had been “a better way of doing that”. Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told Sky News that households struggling to pay their energy bills should contact their supplier for support. Jarvis said: One of the things that’s coming in this quarter is that the government has announced an increase in the warm home discount, so that will help some of the lowest income households in the country and see them receive an additional £150 towards their energy. If people are struggling with their bills, I would very much urge them to talk to their supplier. I know it’s often the thing people don’t want to do, but there is support available. Speaking about the news of a 2% rise in energy bills from October for a typical household in England, Scotland and Wales, director general of markets at Ofgem, Tim Jarvis, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday: That’s slightly lower than the rate of inflation, but is nevertheless a rise, and I recognise that that’s going to be unwelcome for many households. If this is a cap on what suppliers can charge, it’s important to remember that people can get cheaper deals in the fixed rate market, and we’ve already got about a third of households that are on fixed rate deals – but there have been increases in prices, in costs related to the network and related to policy costs from government, which have led to this slight increase this quarter. Jarvis added: I recognise that it’s difficult for households, as a lot of essential goods have been going up higher than the rate of inflation. As I say, today’s rise is lower than the rate of inflation, but I think people are going to struggle to feel that in their pockets with the other things that are going on. It is welcome that the government is expanding the help available to households on low incomes. We’ve been calling for that for some time, so that’s a welcome additional increase this winter to try and help people with their bills. Jarvis also said that Ofgemwill be looking at upgrading the country’s network to stabilise prices in the long term. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We have seen prices come down by around 60% since the height of the crisis, and that’s even taking into account the level of government support that was made available at that time to deal with the increase in prices. But we are entering a period where we’re looking to try and stabilise the bill that is largely going to be about getting off international gas prices. It is that volatility that is making prices very difficult to predict, and we’re seeing big spikes and big reductions over time. And that’s why it’s so important that we’re investing in the network, and the investment in the network will enable us to get access to clean energy and cheaper energy in the longer term. Labour’s plan for change will protect consumers, the party said, following Ofgem’s announcement that the energy price cap will rise by 2% from October. According to the PA news agency, a Labour Party spokesperson said: Energy bills soared under the Conservatives because they tied our country to the fossil fuel rollercoaster and working people are still paying the price. From banning onshore wind to failing to deliver new nuclear, their reckless decisions left Britain exposed to wholesale gas prices that are still 75% higher than before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. That’s why Nigel Farage’s unpatriotic war on clean energy would be a total disaster for families, businesses and our economy. His destructive plans would push bills higher, kill nearly a million jobs and scrap billions of pounds of vital investment across the country that will strengthen our energy security. This Labour government’s plan for change is protecting consumers with three million more families getting £150 off their bills through the warm home discount, a total of six million in all, as we continue to invest in clean homegrown power to bring energy bills down for good. Energy costs will rise for millions of British households this autumn after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill increased by 2% to £1,755. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, will raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of just over £35 a year for the average home, following a rise in European gas prices. The modest increase follows a brief reprieve from rising energy bills over the summer when the energy price cap fell by 7% to £1,720 from July because of lower market prices. Energy bills will also increase because of an expansion of the government’s warm home discount scheme, which is expected to add about £15 to a typical bill, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight, an energy consultancy. About 9 million households who buy their energy through variable tariffs will see an immediate impact on their bills when the cap takes effect in October. Households could face even higher bills if they use more than the typical amount of energy. This is because the cap, which is recalculated every three months, limits the rate energy suppliers can charge customers for each unit of gas and electricity – not the total bill. The return to rising energy bills means the typical household will pay about £600 a year more on its annual bill than before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused gas market prices to soar. The rising price cap is likely to reignite the debate over the affordability of the UK’s energy as households look ahead to winter. The UK has had reassurance from France that the deal between the two countries to allow small boat interceptions in the English Channel “will go ahead”, Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said, reports the PA news agency. He told Times Radio: The Home Office have already set out that they’ve had reassurance from the French interior ministry that this change in maritime law will go ahead. Thomas-Symonds added: We’ve had that reassurance it will go ahead. And it is important, because what that particular change is talking about is the ability for French police to intercept the boats within 300 metres of the shore in shallow water. That was not the case before. Nigel Farage has been accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after announcing plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and pledging to pay despotic regimes such as the Taliban to take them back. Unveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative press conference in Oxford, Farage said he would rip up the UK’s postwar human rights commitments, contained in a range of international conventions, to deport “absolutely anyone” – including women and children – arriving by small boat. Calling asylum seekers a threat to national security and to British women, he claimed his plans would stop Channel crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”. Downing Street accused Farage of not being serious about his plans, but in a sign of how Reform has set the tone for public debate, the prime minister’s spokesperson refused to criticise his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge” or his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major civil disorder”. Pushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, as Farage proposed, the spokesperson said the government was “not going to take anything off the table”. The Conservatives merely accused Reform UK of “reheating and recycling” Tory plans. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: We really are through the looking-glass now. Nigel Farage pretending to be patriotic while pledging to rip up Britain’s proud record of leading the world on human rights. As we’ve seen across history, his populist playbook is ugly, powerful and incredibly destructive. We know where it will lead if we don’t stop it. Laura Smith, a co-head of legal at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said: If today feels like a Rubicon moment, it’s because it is. We are hearing proposals that would tear through centuries of British legal tradition – from the Magna Carta to the Human Rights Act – with barely any resistance from those who should be defending those values. The ban on torture is absolute and fundamental; it cannot be bargained away. That mainstream parties have failed to push back is deeply alarming. This isn’t about migration policy any more, it’s about whether we still value the basic human rights and freedoms that define a democratic society. Now more than ever, we must fight against the normalisation of this rhetoric. The Conservatives could “potentially” strike a deal with Afghanistan over migration, the party’s chair has said. Asked directly if the Tories would set up a returns agreement with the Taliban-run country, Kevin Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Well, potentially, yes.” The former minister added that his party’s deportation plan, which was published in May, is “far more comprehensive than the one we’ve seen from Reform, in that it dealt with both legal migration and illegal migration”. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch had refused to say whether she would consider seeking such an agreement when pressed on the issue on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has been accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after announcing plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and pledging to pay despotic regimes such as the Taliban to take them back. Unveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative press conference in Oxford, Farage said he would rip up the UK’s postwar human rights commitments, contained in a range of international conventions, to deport “absolutely anyone” – including women and children – arriving by small boat. Elsewhere, the government has said it wants to get a permanent deal with the EU on food and drink agreed in the next 18 months, as it sets out its stall ahead of talks later this year. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds and Conservative party chair Kevin Hollinrake are on today’s morning media round. I’ll bring you any interesting lines from them as they come in. But first, here are some other developments: UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU – costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027. Government figures released on Tuesday showed it issued 328,727 such licences last year, at a cost of between £113 and £200 each. That would put the total cost to business at somewhere between £37m and £65m. The cost of UK government borrowing has jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Rachel Reeves to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%. Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel’s approval. It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK’s leading universities. Energy costs will rise for millions of British households this autumn after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill increased by 2% to £1,755. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, will raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of just over £35 a year for the average home, following a rise in European gas prices.

     Manchester United began their quest to qualify for the Champions League by cruising to a 4-0 victory over PSV as Elisabeth Terland scored a hat-trick and the midfielder Julia Zigiotti Olme impressed on her debut. Terland’s classy treble, which was accompanied by a close-range finish from Celin Bizet, guaranteed Marc Skinner’s side some form of European football because their worst-case scenario would now be a place in the new second-tier Europa Cup. Their aim, however, is to join Arsenal and Chelsea in the Champions League and, on Wednesday’s evidence, they have a strong chance of doing so. United will face Hammarby of Sweden on Saturday in a 6pm BST kick-off in the final of their mini-competition in this second round of qualifying. All four sides in this mini-group are playing this week’s ties in Stockholm, at the 3Arena, with Hammarby the hosts. If United win on Saturday they would face a two-leg knockout tie in September for a place in the expanded league phase of the Champions League. Thankfully for United fans, their victory over PSV was significantly more straightforward than trying to follow the rather complex qualifying procedure. The Women’s Super League side took total control very early, giving PSV’s players scarcely any time on the ball with a well-orchestrated high press, and their tactics led to the opening goal. The United midfielder Lisa Naalsund, pressing the PSV defence, capitalised on a loose pass, intercepted the ball and slotted an easy pass across to Terland, who had space and time to tuck a good finish into the bottom-right corner with less than seven minutes played. Zigiotti Olme, one of the stronger performers for Sweden at Euro 2025 and part of their side that faced England in a dramatic quarter-final, is one of two United summer signings so far, arriving from Bayern Munich for an undisclosed fee, and she struck the post early on with a left-footed effort. It was a clear chance spurned but the midfielder has every reason to be pleased with her energetic and purposeful performance. She looked composed and confident on the ball, helped drive the team forward and was exemplary with her work rate as Skinner’s team dominated in midfield. It was not long before it was 2-0, when Anna Sandberg’s left-wing cross led to a shot for Ella Toone, whose effort was saved but palmed only as far as Bizet, who lifted the rebound into the roof of the net. Eight minutes after half-time, Terland got her second after a pass from Toone set her up, and the striker had her hat-trick in the 63rd minute when she raced through the middle and fired home with another good finish. United, who are taking part in this stage of qualifying by virtue of their third-placed finish in the WSL, were without their second summer signing, Fridolina Rolfö, who will be out for two or three weeks with a slight knock. Also absent were Rachel Williams, Leah Galton and the England midfielder Grace Clinton, who missed the trip with a “little niggle”, Skinner said, but his side made light work of this first hurdle on their journey towards potentially joining Europe’s elite.

43) Why ICJ Judge Sebutinde faces calls to quit from Israel genocide case — Al Jazeera (2025-08-27)

     Calls for an investigation come after Sebutinde says, ‘The Lord is counting on me to stand on the side of Israel.’ She also dissented in the ICJ’s provisional order in January 2024.
     By Al Jazeera Staff
     The International Commission of Jurists has filed a formal request for an investigation into International Court of Justice (ICJ) Vice President Julia Sebutinde over her recent comments about Israel.
     The commission, which advocates for human rights and rule of law worldwide, argued that Sebutinde’s position on Israel reveals a bias that brings judicial integrity into question. Sebutinde, who is one of the 17 judges in the ICJ genocide case against Israel, also faces other critics.
     Here is more about Sebutinde, what she said and why she is facing criticism:
     Sebutinde is one of the judges hearing South Africa’s genocide case against Israel. These are the same judges who voted on provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza in January 2024.
     Sebutinde, 71, is a Ugandan judge who is currently serving her second term at the ICJ, where she has sat since March 2012. She is the first African woman appointed to the The Hague-based ICJ. She was elected as the vice president of the top United Nations court in February 2024.
     According to the Institute for African Women in Law, Sebutinde was raised by a family of modest means during Uganda’s independence movement. She attended Lake Victoria Primary School in Entebbe, Uganda, and Gayaza High School, a girls boarding school. She earned her law degree from Makerere University in 1977.
     In 1990, Sebutinde obtained a master of laws degree with distinction from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, which also awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2009 for her legal achievements.
     Before joining the ICJ, she served as a judge on the Special Court for Sierra Leone beginning in 2007.
     In a case filed in December 2023, South Africa alleged that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza during the war that began on October 7, 2023. South Africa argued that Israel’s actions in Palestine were genocidal because they intended to “bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”.
     On January 26, 2024, the ICJ issued a ruling on a number of interim steps. It ordered six provisional measures, telling Israel to:
     Fifteen of the 17 judges voted for all the emergency measures to be put in place. An Israeli judge voted for two of the six measures to be implemented. Sebutinde was the only judge to vote against all the measures.
     In her dissenting opinion, Sebutinde wrote: “In my respectful dissenting opinion the dispute between the State of Israel and the people of Palestine is essentially and historically a political one. It is not a legal dispute susceptible to judicial settlement by the Court.”
     She also stated that South Africa did not demonstrate that Israel’s alleged actions were “committed with the necessary genocidal intent, and that as a result, they are capable of falling within the scope of the Genocide Convention”.
     The court’s final verdict is still awaited. Last year, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes.
     Several rights organisations have called Israeli actions in Gaza genocide. Israel has also been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during nearly 23 months of war, which have killed more than 62,000 Palestinians.
     The Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, made up of 60 judges and lawyers, wrote a letter on Friday to ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa requesting the investigation. It cited remarks Sebutinde made on August 10 at Watoto Church in Kampala, Uganda, where she said: “The Lord is counting on me to stand on the side of Israel.”
     The letter added that Principle 2 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary affirms that “the judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any … improper influences … from any quarter and for any reason.”
     Sebutinde’s remarks are “inconsistent with these principles”, said the letter, signed by the commission’s secretary-general, Santiago Canton.
     Canton closed the letter by urging Iwasawa to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Sebutinde and take remedial actions if the allegations are found to be true.
     While an investigation takes place, Canton requested Iwasawa remove Sebutinde from further proceedings in the ICJ case filed by South Africa.
     The government of Uganda distanced itself from her dissenting opinion.
     “Justice Sebutinde’s ruling at the International Court of Justice does not represent the Government of Uganda’s position on the situation in Palestine,” Adonia Ayebare, Uganda’s ambassador to the UN, posted on X in January last year.
     The ICJ statute says members of the ICJ cannot be dismissed unless other members unanimously agree that they no longer fulfil the required conditions.
     If a judge is dismissed, the ICJ registrar makes a formal notification to the UN secretary-general and this notification renders the position vacant.
     The ICJ website adds that this has never happened.
     The website sets standards for its judges, stating: “Judges must be elected from among persons of high moral character, who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices, or are jurisconsults of recognised competence in international law.”
     It also adds that “once elected, a Member of the Court is a delegate neither of the government of his own country nor of that of any other State.”
     The ICJ statute adds that before assuming duties at the ICJ, members must make a solemn declaration that they will exercise their powers impartially and conscientiously.
     The ICJ has 15 judges elected for nine-year terms by the UN General Assembly and the Security Council.
     For the case that South Africa brought against Israel, an Israeli judge and a South African judge joined the bench. From South Africa, senior retired Judge Dikgang Moseneke came on board while former Israeli Supreme Court Chief Justice Aharon Barak joined the case from Israel.

44) From an A-League title to the brink of collapse: how did it all go wrong for Western United? | Jack Snape — The Guardian (2025-08-26)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/from-an-a-league-title-to-the-brink-of-collapse-how-did-it-all-go-wrong-for-western-united
   Text:
     Spirits were high in May after what may turn out to be the last night of A-League football at Ironbark Fields, when a Noah Botić hat-trick against Adelaide sent Western United to the semi-finals. There had been financial concerns swirling in the months preceding, but in the post-match function among sponsors and friends the club’s chair Jason Sourasis appeared untroubled. The former AFL player agent and dealmaker is known to be personable, and he was at his attentive best as he entertained the Sydney-based mother of his star striker with a promise of flights down to Melbourne for the following week’s semi-final. At that moment, the club he helped conceive appeared to have a future. Investment by a US-based group had just been announced, and Western United were chasing a second A-League Men’s title. Sourasis’ star striker was on the verge of a Socceroos call-up. Yet from the moment the lights went out in Tarneit that night, the outlook for Western United has soured. Within days, the club was bundled out of the A-League Men championship race by crosstown rivals Melbourne City and Botić moved at the end of his contract to play in Austria. The takeover by the prospective owners has stalled, and Western United – a club that promised a new vision for football in Australia, with a dedicated football stadium and their own suburb nestled in a growth corridor – is within days of collapse. Rewind seven years and Western United represented hope. They had been chosen, alongside Macarthur, in an expansion process run by Football Australia as the A-League looked to rekindle growth ahead of the decoupling of the club competition from the national governing body. The bid involved more than a football club. Melbourne’s west was growing, and Wyndham City Council found an ideal partner in the A-League aspirants. The club would provide an anchor for a phased development on the western fringe of Tarneit to help build land values in the area, and would oversee construction including residential and commercial real estate as well as the jewel of the bid, a football-dedicated 15,000-seat stadium. Former Socceroo and Western United director Steve Horvat described the ground as a “game-changer” when former FA chief executive David Gallop announced the new franchise in 2018. The timing was awkward, given it came in the days before the A-Leagues were granted independence. But FA awarded the licence in consultation with other clubs, and few would argue it was in error. Sports stars like Scott Pendlebury and Jack Ziebell, contacts from Sourasis’ time working in AFL football, as well as tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis and basketballers Dante Exum and Chris Goulding, came on as investors to lend the project legitimacy and startup capital. So while the club was at that stage literally an empty paddock, the choice was made with the long-term in mind. Covid saw to that. Midway through the club’s first season – during which Western United reached the men’s semi-finals and once drew more than 10,000 fans to Geelong – the virus shut down Victoria and suffocated the state for the next two years. Investment crucial for development of the precinct and stadium dried up, and the club has struggled to build momentum in the years since. Under new coach John Aloisi, its 2022 A-League Men’s championship was an on-field triumph, but not enough cared. Attendances dropped the following season, and the club was barely drawing 3,000 to each home match during a financial year in which the club lost $12m. Documents lodged with Asic in July revealed liabilities exceeded assets by $55m. Fifa has banned the club from registering players due to unpaid wages, and former midfielder Riku Danzaki raised during court proceedings this month that late payments were one consideration in his decision to chase a windfall by betting on himself accruing yellow cards. The vulnerability for the club has always been to see through the uncertainty – and limited cash reserves – of the short-term with a focus on the long-term vision, but some creditors have run out of patience. Lawyers will appear in court on Thursday at the latest hearing as part of a winding up process initiated by the tax office. It also involves the Victorian state revenue office, the local distributor of kit supplier Kappa and a marketing agency. The court has previously heard the creditors seek in excess of $10m, and there is little evidence the mooted investors will be able to deliver the reported $100m investment that will clear the club’s debts. The most this group, known as KAM Melbourne, has paid so far as part of the deal announced with much fanfare in May is $1,500. A Football Australia regulatory process has already stripped Western United of their licence to play matches two weeks ago. The outcome of the club’s appeal of this decision is due at the end of this week, conveniently after the court hearing, however the club has a right to appeal again to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). If the KAM Melbourne deal never eventuates, there will be implications for many cascading from what will soon come. The APL is currently working on a backup draw in case the coming season – due to start in two months – won’t feature Western United. What the rest of the year looks like if the club takes the licensing decision all the way to CAS is not clear. The future of the public-private partnership with Wyndham City Council is up in the air. The council has been forward in making it known that the land on which Ironbark Fields sits remains in council’s hands. But they have commissioned former state minister Justin Madden to prepare a report by the end of September on how to handle the situation, and the council is “deeply committed to this unique initiative”, according to Wyndham corporate services director Mark Rossiter. Western United’s players are also in limbo. Their senior professionals may struggle to find another club with such a short turnaround, and the collapse of the club’s junior pathways will interrupt the development of many. Then there are the club’s fans. Western United’s Facebook page was updated with a post of photos of players in pre-season training last week, captioned simply “building”. The responses were quick: “Building what?” “A stadium?” “I wish people would keep their negative comments to themselves,” another replied. “If you were a supporter you wouldn’t think this was a joke. Some of us are trying very hard to stay positive and want to hang on to the club we love.”

45) More pain for Reeves as government borrowing cost nears 27-year high — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

   Text:
     The cost of UK government borrowing has jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Rachel Reeves to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%. That pushed the UK’s long-term borrowing costs close to a spike in April of 5.66%, when 30-year bond yields reached their highest since 1998. UK borrowing costs have risen sharply in recent months, increasing the cost of financing UK government debt to more than £100bn a year – almost 10% of the annual budget. Economists have said the UK faces a unique strain on its financial position at a time when higher welfare and healthcare costs and rapid ageing are driving up the level of borrowing across most industrialised nations. Reeves is expected to be faced with a deficit of between £20bn and £40bn when she delivers the autumn budget. To maintain her fiscal rules and maintain the £10bn buffer in place under current plans, the chancellor will need to find between £30bn and £50bn in either extra taxes, reduced spending or higher borrowing. Higher borrowing bills and U-turns on proposed welfare cuts have heightened the expectation of increases in taxes later this year. Investors also fear the UK is suffering from high inflation that will persist for several years, devaluing their UK funds. Catherine Mann, a member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee, said UK policymakers were underestimating “inflation persistence”. She said: “There is an increasing tension between inflation persistence and weak growth, the trade-off that we currently face in the United Kingdom.” She said the Bank needed to maintain high interest rates to bring down inflation and then cut aggressively to revive the economy. Mohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, and economic adviser to Allianz, said the UK had fewer domestic and external shock absorbers to relieve both immediate and longer-term structural challenges. “For example, it lacks the highly dynamic and innovative private sector that the US has and, compared to France, has fewer external safety nets, such as the [vast resources of the] European Central Bank,” he told the Guardian. El-Erian added: “The core of the UK’s problem lies in stagnant productivity. Over the past 15 years, productivity growth has averaged a quarter of the annual average of prior decades. This has created a long-term drag on growth, and its continued absence will put even greater immediate and longer-term structural pressures on the economy.” Jagjit Chadha, an economics professor at the University of Cambridge, said the situation was “dire” and Reeves needed to “get a grip” on the government’s finances. Chadha, a former head of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a thinktank, said the government had found itself in a vulnerable situation, and a global economic shock could force the UK to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. “The backdrop is a lack of control over public debt, high debt service costs because our borrowing rates are high and a dwindling demand to lend to the UK,” he said. “This would be most likely manifest as a failure in a debt management office (DMO) auction and a freezing of our debt markets. “We are vulnerable to a global interest rate shock or a collapse in confidence in the government, which would leave our fragile position exposed. Our political masters have time and time again shown an unwillingness to raise taxes and lower expenditure so the markets are increasingly incredulous. “My point is that we are now very vulnerable to a bad draw.” The Treasury is expected to auction about £300bn of debt in this financial year. A DMO auction is due to go ahead on Wednesday to raise £5bn. Charlie Bean, a former Bank of England deputy governor, said: “The fiscal position is not good, though talk of a £50bn hole and the imminent need for an IMF bailout is over the top. “But the chancellor certainly made a rod for her own back when she committed herself both to not raising any of the main tax rates (and thus forcing herself to raise revenue in more harmful ways) and also chose to run the public finances with a minuscule buffer of just £10bn.” He said Labour backbenchers had made the situation worse “by rendering it all but impossible to cut spending in any meaningful way”. Bean said the government needed to raise income tax “or, better, get rid of the age ceiling on employee national insurance and integrate it with income tax so that the burden falls more on the better-off oldies like me. “Doing so would show that she had seized the initiative and would probably be rewarded positively for doing so by the markets.” In 2022, before Liz Truss’s election as Tory leader and prime minister, the yield on 30-year bonds sold by the UK government was about 2.4%. After the mini-budget that Truss orchestrated with her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, the 30-year bond yield jumped to 5%, before falling back to about 3.5% after many of the mini-budget measures were reversed. By Labour’s election victory last July, the 30-year bond yield had risen back over 4.5%, and has climbed since, remaining above 5% since January.

     Philip Inman takes a very London-centric view (Can a nation in crisis rely on the baby boomer generation to step up? I think the UK is about to find out, 21 August). Certainly in my small northern town, retirees haven’t had a financial bonanza from property price hikes. Also in my part of the world services that used to be provided by local authorities are now largely undertaken by an army of older people, including litterpicking, gardening in communal areas, local radio, school holiday activities for children, and food bank collection and delivery. Not to mention the myriad charities who couldn’t provide services without the time given by retirees. At the moment older people are reluctant to move into the housing provided by some private developers, as this can leave a financial headache for their children when they die. Perhaps this is an area where Inman could usefully focus his journalistic zeal rather than scapegoating older people. This sort of reporting, which takes the experience of a small subset of the population and extrapolates that to a whole generation, is intrinsically flawed. Dr Susan Graves Lydiate, Merseyside • Philip Inman appears to be out of touch with many baby boomers’ lived experiences. We tried to move from our three-bedroom detached home several years ago without success; none of our viewers were young families. They were couples our age seeking to downsize. We spent many weeks trying to find a suitable home, but were dismayed at poor-quality building, rabbit-hutch-sized gardens and tiny rooms, and huge, faceless estates without transport or facilities. We decided there was no point in reducing our circumstances as well as paying stamp duty and hefty removal costs. We have lived here for nearly 30 years, we support village activities, local campaigns and local politics, and yes, we enjoy our holidays, but they are by no means all jet-setting. We have certainly, as many of our generation have, given back in time and money. This blame game serves no useful purpose. Christine Hey Nottingham • I’d like to downsize. But houses in town, where activities and facilities are located, are more highly priced than where I am, 1.5 miles out of town. And there aren’t that many of them. I don’t want to live too close to the town centre – it’s noisy at night. If volume builders talked to us, maybe they would provide the houses for us. But we are ignored. At 72, I’m not ready for a sheltered flat with carers provided. So, Mr Inman, you sort the problem with the builders. They might listen to you. On the other hand, perhaps a chat with boomers might help you. I recommend contacting a National Women’s Register group (previously National Housewives Register, set up following a letter to this paper). The ladies would welcome you for a lively discussion. Likewise, the University of the Third Age, a self-help group for older people. Just don’t get us started on how frugal we were in our younger days or on how much volunteering many of us do. Judy Windwood Wimborne, Dorset • Phillip Inman urges older people to move out of their three-bedroom houses and he’s right, of course, but as a couple (79 and 82) in the middle of doing that, I understand why more don’t. Luckily our house sale went smoothly, but the whole process is still exhausting, frustrating and sometimes worrying. There are the repeated trips to the tip and charity shops; trying to find out why the flat you are moving to is the only one in the block listed as not having full fibre broadband; trying to end a landline contract with a company that employs a machine to read the documents you send it, only to reject them because its machine can’t read them; trying to explain that you haven’t got your new address on your driving licence because you can’t change the address on your driving licence until you have actually moved; discovering that your once-expensive Georgian and Victorian furniture is worth almost nothing … and all this while navigating the usual hospital appointments etc, and cleaning bits of your house you haven’t cleaned for years. I’m sure it will be worth it if we make it to moving day without murdering each other or jumping off the Suspension Bridge, but I can understand why others can’t face it and just stay put. Rosemary Chamberlin Bristol • Not all of us boomers are lounging around in half-empty houses, ruminating on our next vacation. As a 70-year-old still in full-time freelance work, I, and my wife, share a five-bedroom house in south-east London that now sleeps seven. Both our children have moved back, along with three of their friends. All five pay a rent that helps us to afford the rocketing utilities, but also that enables them to live in London. If we downsized, that would throw five people on to a rental market they could not afford on their current salaries. And that’s if they could find anywhere; the reason they’re back living with us is precisely because they can’t. And we also seem to enjoy each other’s company. So if that isn’t stepping up, I don’t know what is. Peter Grimsdale Dulwich, London

47) Mainoo wants to leave Manchester United after being sidelined by Amorim — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

     Kobbie Mainoo wants to leave Manchester United after being squeezed to the margins by Ruben Amorim. The midfielder has not played a minute of the team’s two games this season and was demoted from first choice to substitute when he returned from injury last December. United would countenance a suitable deal, but there may be a lack of attractive suitors for the 20‑year‑old player this late in a window that closes on Monday. Mainoo has his sights set on joining a club in the Champions League. Mainoo started England’s Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain last summer, less than two months after he scored for United in their FA Cup final win against Manchester City. But his career has stalled under Amorim, who has said Mainoo is competing for a place with Bruno Fernandes, the captain. The head coach has not found a role for Mainoo in his 3-4-3. Amorim believes the academy graduate does not have the attributes to be a first choice in central midfield and has not been sufficiently impressed by the player’s performances further forward. Mainoo is not the only United player with an eye on the exit. Alejandro Garnacho is among those to be told they should find a new club and Chelsea made further contact over the weekend regarding the winger but the clubs’ valuations are misaligned. United want £50m while the Club World Cup winners value him at £35m. A key factor in United’s valuation of Garnacho is that Noni Madueke moved to Arsenal from Chelsea for £52m and Anthony Elanga left Nottingham Forest for Newcastle in a £55m transfer this summer. Those players’ statistics are inferior to Garnacho’s, which has been pointed out to Chelsea, who have been in negotiations with the United executive in the past few days. Chelsea could go up to £40m, including add-ons, in an attempt to get a deal done. Fernandes, who missed a penalty on Sunday in the 1-1 draw at Fulham, could still be the subject of a bid from a Saudi Arabian club. In the spring Al-Hilal offered about £100m for the Portugal international but he decided against the transfer. It is understood United and the player have not had further contact from a Saudi club. If Fernandes is sold this may provide funds for United to revive their interest in Carlos Baleba. Brighton’s minimum price for the No 6 is £100m. Chelsea want their squad to contain four wingers and see Garnacho competing with Jamie Gittens for a place on the left. Tyrique George, another left-sided option, has interest from Roma and is expected to leave. Enzo Maresca can choose from Estêvão Willian and Pedro Neto on the right. The pursuit of Garnacho continues to hinge on outgoings at Chelsea, who need to meet the terms of a Uefa settlement stipulating they must have a “positive transfer balance” to register new players for the Champions League. The desire to bring in another winger means Chelsea see Garnacho as a bigger priority than RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons, an attacking midfielder. That stance could change if a buyer is found for Christopher Nkunku, who continues to attract interest from Aston Villa, Bayern Munich and Leipzig. Nkunku will be an option as an attacking midfielder if he stays. Chelsea also hold an interest in Fermín López but it is understood Barcelona do not want to sell him. Chelsea are also looking to sell Nicolas Jackson, who has fallen from favour after the arrivals of João Pedro and Liam Delap. Their preference is for the Senegal striker to leave on a permanent deal but their £80m valuation has put off potential suitors. Bayern are interested in Jackson and have held talks over a loan. One compromise could be Chelsea agreeing to a loan that includes an obligation to buy Jackson, who has also been tracked by Villa, Napoli and Juventus. Other players expected to leave include Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi, who is wanted by Bournemouth on loan. Carney Chukwuemeka has joined Borussia Dortmund in a package worth £24m. Fulham and Crystal Palace are monitoring Sterling.

48) Is the AI boom finally starting to slow down? — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

   Text:
     The sudden AI cooling-off period Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Drive down the 280 freeway in San Francisco and you might believe AI is everywhere, and everything. Nearly every billboard advertises an AI related product: “We’ve Automated 2,412 BDRs.” “All that AI and still no ROI?” “Cheap on-demand GPU clusters.” It’s hard to know if you’re interpreting the industry jargon correctly while zooming past in your vehicle. The signs are just one example of the tech industry’s en-masse pivot to AI, a technology that the executives who have the most to gain from it say will be universe-shifting, inevitable and unavoidable. In California’s tech heartland, every company is now an AI company, just like every company became a tech company sometime in the 2010s. But just beneath the surface of the breathless promotion of every startup’s AI prowess, cracks are beginning to appear. Some of AI’s biggest boosters, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman, have warned that investors are overvaluing the potential returns on AI. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said at a private dinner with reporters. “My opinion is yes.” Altman’s statements coincided with a concession that OpenAI botched the roll-out of the latest ChatGPT model – which he once promised would be a significant improvement over the current GPT 4.5 model. Sure, Altman’s comments may have been geared at getting investors to consider not investing in his competitors. But there are other signs. Just this past week, a new study from MIT found that 95% of generative AI projects have delivered little to no growth in revenue. And tech stocks of companies with huge AI pushes tumbled this week: Palantir saw a 9% drop in shares, Oracle saw a 5.8% drop, chipmaker Nvidia fell 3.5% and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices as well as semiconductor designer Arm each saw 5% or more drop in shares. Not even the possibility of lower interest rates, which buoyed stocks in other sectors last week, was enough to turn around tech’s market slide. Just beneath the breathless promotion of AI, cracks are beginning to appear Even Meta, which had been reportedly spending billions to recruit the top AI talent, announced an AI hiring freeze. Meta sought to downplay the news, with the company’s chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, posting on X last week: “We are truly only investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs as a company. Any reporting to the contrary of that is clearly mistaken.” The sudden AI cooling-off period comes just a week after many of these companies reported largely stellar earnings despite upping their expectation for how many billions they plan to spend on building out their AI capacity over the next few months and years. At the same dinner with reporters, Altman said he expected OpenAI to spend “trillions” on datacenter expansion in the “not very distant future”, according to the Verge. While the latest round of AI jitters is being framed as a sign that the AI hype bubble may soon burst, it’s perhaps more of a needed market correction – a reality check for investors who can’t see outside of the Silicon Valley echo chamber. Even the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns that some of the laser focus on achieving artificial general intelligence – or the idea that AI could at some point match or surpass human intelligence – is misguided. “It is uncertain how soon artificial general intelligence can be achieved,” reads a column Schmidt co-wrote with China and AI policy lead Selina Xu. “We worry that Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists.” Schmidt and Xu spend much of the rest of the column boosting the benefits and milestones AI has already met but raising concerns about how the build-at-all-costs strategy Silicon Valley is taking in pursuit of a super-intelligent AI is not reflective of the reality for the general public. “There’s a widening schism between the technologists who feel the A.G.I. – a mantra for believers who see themselves on the cusp of the technology – and members of the general public who are skeptical about the hype and see A.I. as a nuisance in their daily lives,” they wrote. It’s unclear if the industry will take heed of these warnings. Investors look to every quarterly earnings report for signs that each company’s billions in capex spending is somehow being justified and executives are eager to give them hope. Boosting, boasting about and hyping the supposed promise and inevitability of AI is a big part of keeping investor concerns about the extra $10bn each company adds to its spending projections every quarter at bay. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, recently said in the future if you’re not using AI glasses you’ll be at a cognitive disadvantage much like not wearing corrective lenses. That means tech firms such as Meta and Google will probably continue making the AI features that they offer today an almost inescapable part of using their products in a play to boost their training data and user numbers. That said, the first big test of this AI reality check will come on Wednesday when chipmaker Nvidia – one of the building blocks of most LLMs – will report its latest earnings. Analysts seem pretty optimistic but after a shaky week for its stocks, investor reactions to Nvidia’s earnings and any updates on spending will be a strong signal of whether they have a continued appetite for the AI hype machine. Have you bonded with an AI? Heavy ChatGPT users have formed strong emotional attachments to the AI, which means that, when it changes, they notice. In the case of OpenAI’s most recent update, the release of the AI model GPT-5, these users got upset. My colleague Dani Anguiano reports: “It was really horrible, and it was a really tough time,” said Linn Vailt, a software developer in Sweden, about the update. “It’s like somebody just moved all of the furniture in your house.” ChatGPTquickly made adjustments, promising an update to 5’s personality and restoring access to older models – for subscribers only – while acknowledging it had underestimated the importance of some features to its users. *** Have you bonded with an AI?

My colleague Lauren Almeida reports: TikTok has put hundreds of UK content moderators’ jobs at risk, even as tighter rules come into effect to stop the spread of harmful material online. The viral video app said several hundred jobs in its trust and safety team could be affected in the UK, as well as south and south-east Asia, as part of a global reorganisation. In September, the company fired its entire team of 300 content moderators in the Netherlands. In October, it then announced it would replace about 500 content moderation employees in Malaysia as part of its shift towards AI. Last week, TikTok workers in Germany held strikes over layoffs in its trust and safety team, also the intended target of layoffs. Read the full story: Hundreds of TikTok UK moderator jobs at risk despite new online safety rules The cuts are part of a global push by the company towards moderating content with artificial intelligence. Automated systems already carry out some 85% of content removals on the app, according to TikTok. ByteDance, its parent company, seems to want to move the percentage upward. The company is not hemming and hawing about the importance of human oversight and insight into thorny issues. Business is booming, with a 38% increase in revenue in the UK and Europe, per regulatory filings. American tech giants are moving in the same direction, led by Meta’s disbandment of its fact-checking initiatives and Elon Musk’s deep cuts to the trust and safety teams at X. TikTokhas carried out smaller-scale layoffs of trust and safety teams in the United States. There have not been mass firings of content moderators. Why? Perhaps because any move that might elicit backlash would be dangerous at a moment when the official US attitude toward the app couldn’t be less clear. The White House created a TikTok account that launched last Tuesday. You may recall that the past two American presidents have tried to shut the app out of the US. The ban is still in place, held off only by flimsy executive orders extending a pause on its enforcement, which may only persist as long as Donald Trump’s goodwill does.

49) Gaupset to Zigiotti: stars to watch in Women’s Champions League this week  | Moving the Goalposts — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

     The second round of Women’s Champions League qualifying gets under way on Wednesday with several notable teams entering, among them Manchester United, Brann, Glasgow City and Roma. The winners of Wednesday’s semi-finals will progress to Saturday’s finals and play for a place in mid-September’s final round of qualifying. Here are eight players to keep an eye on this week. Julia Zigiotti (Manchester United): With Fridolina Rolfö continuing to recover from the injury that hampered her at Euro 2025, plenty of eyes will be on her compatriot and now club-mate Zigiotti. The Swede was United’s other marquee signing this summer and brings a wealth of experience. The tenacious defensive midfielder arrived after a double-winning season with Bayern Munich and was at the heart of her country’s run to the quarter-finals in Switzerland. Zigiotti will be familiar to Women’s Super League fans from her two-year spell at Brighton. Her key qualities lie in her ability to link the transition from defence to attack as well as her quality in the press and work ethic. Her introduction will perhaps allow Dominique Janssen to return to her more natural defensive position. Riola Xhemaili (PSV): The midfielder wrote her name into the Swiss football history books this summer with a 92nd-minute equaliser against Finland that sent the hosts to their first European Championship quarter-final. Xhemaili made a permanent move to PSV after a successful loan from Wolfsburg last season and will be looking to take another big scalp with the Eredivisie side when they face United on Wednesday. She scored 10 goals and provided six assists in the last campaign and has become an integral part of Roeland ten Berge’s side. Oona Sevenius (Rosengård): Euro 2025 spectators will remember Sevenius’s impact in an exciting Finland team. Her beautiful finish against Norway on her first start at a major tournament and the celebration that followed marked the 21-year-old as one to watch on the European stage. After some time in Italy and a loan at FC Como, the forward signed for Rosengård in January and has made 13 appearances this season. The Swedish team will be favourites to come through an opening tie with North Macedonia’s Ljuboten. Signe Gaupset (Brann): The midfielder’s career has been on a steep upward trajectory since she broke into Brann’s side in 2021 and shows no sign of slowing. One of the best youngsters in Switzerland this summer, the 20-year-old Norwegian produced a memorable display against Iceland, scoring twice and providing two assists. Gaupset is the jewel in Brann’s crown with 11 goals and eight assists registered in this season’s Toppserien and she will be looking forward to the challenge of breaking down Inter’s defence. Some of the top clubs in Europe will be trying to prise her away from the Bergen-based team, with whom in March she signed a new contract until 2027. Alayah Pilgrim (Roma): After significant battles with injury last season, the Switzerland international recovered to finish the campaign with Roma and earn her selection for Pia Sundhage’s Euro 2025 squad. The 22-year-old had to settle for being an impact player from the bench but made her mark on her major tournament bow with a goal in the 2-0 victory over Iceland. A forward with pace to burn, she is a problem for any defence and will be relishing the opportunity to run at the backline of Aktobe, a club from Kazakhstan. Smilla Holmberg (Hammarby): The right-back had a summer of contrasting fortunes. The joy of her standout performance and goal in Sweden’s 4-1 demolition of Germany was followed by the agony of missing the penalty that sent England to the semi-finals. The dynamic 18-year-old is a star in the making with the potential to become the complete modern full-back. Her emergence at Hammarby has been sensational and she is one of the side’s most productive players in the Damallsvenskan this season. Roisin Molloy (Athlone Town): The Irish club’s inaugural appearance in Champions League qualifying brought a 4-0 victory over Cardiff City last month and the 23-year-old Molloy was a standout performer with two goals and an assist. The right-winger has been catching the eye domestically since signing for Athlone in 2021. She made 18 starts last season and scored five goals as Colin Fortune’s side won their first league title and is continuing in a rich vein of form. The quality of the seasoned Icelandic champions Breiðablik will be the next challenge for the exciting midfielder. Erín McLaughlin (Glasgow City): The Republic of Ireland international moved to Glasgow on a three-year deal this summer after a season with Portsmouth. The 22-year-old midfielder has shown strong potential, her vision, technical ability and energy shining through in her performances at Peamount United and, last season, in the Championship. She has caught the eye of Carla Ward, who called her up for Ireland’s summer friendlies against the USA.

50) Manchester United not equipped for Europe this season, admits Ruben Amorim — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

     Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United’s squad would not have been equipped to play European football this season. A slow start to the Premier League has yielded one point from two matches as United turn attention to Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie at League Two Grimsby, where Amorim has promised to shuffle the pack. United, having lost last season’s Europa League final and finished 15th in the Premier League, are not one of the nine English clubs playing European football this season. Amorim said that could be to his team’s long-term benefit. “I think we were not prepared to play Europe,” he said. “That is my feeling; to have strong games in the Champions League and to play Premier League we need time to develop as a team. “I said last season we need time to prepare for every game. The games are really competitive and we need to build to our base and then to perform. And then in the future we need to have Europe for everyone to play games.” Signalling his intention to make changes at Grimsby, Amorim said: “We have three games this week, we have quality players and we have to rotate to try to win every game.” In the league for United, Burnley’s visit this Saturday follows Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Fulham and the opening home defeat to Arsenal. Several United players have been linked with an exit, including the striker Rasmus Højlund. Amorim, asked whether a player linked with a return to Serie A would play at Grimsby, said: “All the players are available, and you make the choice to get the best starting XI to win every game.” Højlund was not on the bench at Craven Cottage. Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are, meanwhile, in the group that the club, on Amorim’s instruction, must speed to the exit in the closing days of the transfer window. Amorim said of players such as Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to play a minute this season but was on the bench at Fulham: “They just need to fight for the places and then everything can change. Sometimes one is playing and at other moments other guys are going to play, so we have the cups; we are going to have a lot of chances for everybody.”

51) Grimsby seek to build on foundations to ‘make it as hostile as we can’ for Manchester United — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

   Text:
     “We’re an ambitious little football club,” the Grimsby Town manager, David Artell, says. “Why can’t we be the next Bournemouth or Brentford?” It is an indication that Manchester United will not be visiting your average League Two side in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, because the Mariners are doing things differently. Artell has spent recent summers scouting in the Faroe Islands – and eating sea urchins with the owners – and tried to sign a player from the Czech league this year. The tone is set at the top by the owners, Andrew Pettit and Jason Stockwood. There is data aplenty at Blundell Park, giving Grimsby an identity and bringing stability, a word sometimes forgotten in the fourth tier. United will be facing an unbeaten team high on confidence and with a long-term strategy to keep pushing them forward. “I appreciate that’s big dreams,” Artell says of the desire to emulate Premier League clubs. “I’m in division four of England, let’s not get carried away, but at the same time we’re unbeaten this season, we’re doing a lot of things right, there’s a long way to go. We’ve put some real good foundations in place for the rest of the season.” From Víkingur to Truro, Artell and his recruitment team are combing through statistics to find gems who can help the club to feature in the third tier for the first time since 2003-04. “We can’t pay the most money because I’ve not got the biggest budget, it’s not Chelsea or Oxford or somewhere really exclusive to live, but it has got its real qualities,” Artell says of his sales pitch. “The people are salt of the earth, it’s fairly cheap in terms of houses to live in, one of the cheapest places in the country, you’re going to get well coached, you’re going to get treated properly, you know we’re ambitious, we’re progressive, you’re going to leave a better player whether that’s in one year, three years or five years, whatever the number is. And you’re going to enjoy it here and you’re going to live with a group of players that are all in it together so we know where we are in the grand scheme of things and we’re trying to get better every day.” Artell signed a new three-year contract last month, to show short‑termism is not part of the thinking. The immediate plan, however, is how to get the better of Ruben Amorim and United. The two clubs have not met since 1948, adding to the sense of occasion. Grimsby access the same data as Brighton, a relationship that goes back to when the clubs met in an FA Cup quarter-final two years ago. It shows that playing against Premier League opponents is a bigger event than the minutes on the pitch and a lucrative windfall; it offers the chance to gain insight and share ideas. “We’ve earned our right to be playing against Manchester United by winning in the previous round and we’re here to compete and we’ve got to make it as hostile as we can for them both on and off the pitch,” Artell says. “The fans have been absolutely magnificent – it’ll be a sellout. We are hoping that United don’t particularly like the ground, the dressing rooms.” After Grimsby’s draw at Accrington on Saturday, Artell travelled to London to watch Manchester United be held by Fulham a day later, the banks of the River Thames offering quite a contrast to the Wham Stadium. There are weaknesses to be found in United and Grimsby will be hoping to exploit those, despite the chasm between them in the pyramid. “There is an element of this that can be uncomfortable [for United] and we’ve got to make it so on the pitch,” Artell says. “It’ll be an extremely tough night for us, we’re under no illusions about the size of the task, but it’s a great game. It might be the biggest game some of the lads will ever play in their careers but I want them to see it as an opportunity, not just as an occasion, and this is what helps make players grow and it’s my job to make sure they go out ready to compete.” Regardless of perceived struggles at United, Amorim could offer a full debut to the £73m striker Benjamin Sesko and first starts of the season to England’s Kobbie Mainoo and Cameroon’s André Onana. It may not be a vintage side of yesteryear but it will be full of quality. Grimsby will be hoping to sense some visiting nerves because, regardless of United’s status or XI, a victory for the hosts would be a historic upset. “We’re unbeaten and we want to make that continue,” Artell says. “However difficult that may be, that’s got to be our belief. We’re not stupid, we’re not getting ahead of ourselves, we know our place, but that doesn’t mean we just roll over. We’re here to compete and we’ve got to make sure that the processes that we have in place are maintained and make sure that the principles on the pitch are maintained and that will give us our best shot. “We need to be authentic and go out there with freedom to express ourselves both with and without the ball and, if we do that, then if there is any emotion after 95, 98 minutes, whatever it takes, then we hope it’s euphoric.”

   Text:
     Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has been chosen to host the next edition of World Sevens Football from 5-7 December this year, after the new, lucrative women’s football competition’s debut “grand slam” event in Portugal in May. The seven-a-side competition was launched earlier this year, with financial backing from co-founder and investor Jennifer Mackesy, a minority owner of the NWSL club Gotham FC, offering a $5m prize pool per tournament – one of the largest prize funds in global women’s sport. Beyond Bancard Field on the campus of Nova Southeastern University, and the home stadium of the USL Super League’s Fort Lauderdale United FC, will host the event. The inaugural eight-team tournament held in Portugal was won by Bayern Munich, who took home the winning prize of $2.5m after beating Manchester United in the final in Estoril. The clubs involved in December’s event are yet to be confirmed, but the Guardian understands that all eight participating teams are likely to be from across the Americas, with teams from Brazil, Mexico and the United States (including NWSL teams) among those in talks to take part. The matches are played using a half-size pitch and seven-a-side goals, with rolling substitutions permitted and 15-minute halves, accompanied by background music throughout. However, what makes the competition particularly different to other small-sided football events that have grown in popularity in recent years is that it involves current, elite players from existing professional clubs, rather than retired players or celebrities. The World Cup-winning former United States winger Tobin Heath is the chair of the World Sevens Football’s player advisory council, a group of former international stars who have been influential to the event’s format, structure and player facilities. Ajax from the Netherlands, the Portuguese club Benfica, the French giants Paris Saint-Germain, AS Roma of Italy, FC Rosengård of Sweden and the English WSL side Manchester City joined Manchester United and Bayern Munich in the inaugural event, which occurred during the run-up to this year’s Women’s Champions League, and was staged nearby in Lisbon from a Wednesday until a Friday. December’s event in Florida will take place across a weekend, starting with group games on Friday 5 December and concluding with a final two days later. It will come two weeks after the 2025 NWSL Championship final.

     Donald Trump has said he is firing Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, in a move viewed as a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over the institution. Who is Lisa Cook? Cook was appointed to the board of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, in 2022, and reappointed by Joe Biden in 2023, for a 14-year term. An academic economist with a doctorate from University of California, Berkeley, she served on Barack Obama’s council of economic advisers. Why does Trump want Cook to go? The president has been pressurising the central back to cut interest rates, to support the US economy and make it cheaper for the government to finance its debts. Cook backed the Fed’s recent decision to leave rates on hold, fearing the impact on inflation of Trump’s tariff policies. Despite the Fed’s nominal independence from the US government, Trump has also criticised its governor, Jay Powell, repeatedly, calling him, among many other things, “too late, too stupid and too political”. The president appears keen not just for Powell to go, but to shake up the entire Fed board so that it more closely reflects his own worldview. Powell is due to step down as chair next May, though his tenure on the Fed board does not end until 2028. Trump recently selected his adviser, Stephen Miran, to fill a seat on the board that had become vacant after the departure of Adriana Kugler. What is Trump’s explanation for firing Cook – and will she step down? In a post on Truth Social, Trump accused Cook of committing fraud in applying for mortgages, by wrongly designating two separate properties as her primary residence. The allegation was originally made last week by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, an agency that regulates the mortgage organisations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “The American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,” Trump wrote. “In light of your deceitful and possibly criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.” Cook appears to be prepared to resist Trump’s attempt to force her out. In a statement released on Monday, she said: “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause’ when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.” A supreme court ruling in May found that it was lawful for the White House to remove a member of the National Labor Relations Board without cause – but made clear the same would not apply to the Fed, since it is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity”. Since then, the Trump administration has been fishing for a “cause” to remove Powell, including questioning his handling of a $2.5bn renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Will Trump get his way on interest rates? It looks like it: Powell gave a significant speech last week at the annual central bankers’ retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which financial markets read as a signal that rates are on their way down. He suggested that weakness in the jobs market was likely to outweigh the potential upward pressure on prices from Trump’s trade war, warning that “the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance”. Does it matter if the Fed’s independence is undermined? The market’s reaction to this latest aggressive move from the White House has been relatively muted, with investors perhaps more focused on anticipating a September rate cut. But over time, many economists believe independence adds to the credibility of the central bank’s battle against inflation, which can sometimes mean raising interest rates – pushing up borrowing costs for consumers – at politically difficult moments. Powell’s predecessor William McChesney Martin called this aspect of central banks’ role “to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going”. The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 80s. Arthur Burns, the former Fed chair, has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide. In the UK, when Labour won power in 1997, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown announced that they would make the Bank of England independent, in the hope of increasing the credibility of the government’s economic policies. Could the Fed furore have effects outside the US? It could, if markets ultimately begin to lose confidence in the Fed’s ability to tackle inflation, driving up the yield on Treasury bonds – a key interest rate, against which many assets around the world are benchmarked. Treasury yields did rise on Tuesday. But for the time being, markets appear willing to overlook Trump’s power grab, and focus on the prospect of an imminent rate cut.

54) Kai Havertz ruled out of Arsenal and Germany games and may need surgery — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

     Kai Havertz will miss Arsenal’s showdown at Liverpool on Sunday and Germany’s World Cup qualifiers next month, with a decision yet to be made on whether the forward needs surgery on a knee injury. Havertz sustained the injury during his substitute appearance against Manchester United on the opening Premier League weekend and did not feature in Arsenal’s 5-0 win against Leeds on Saturday. Mikel Arteta said Arsenal were not sure how serious it was and that they would conduct more tests “to explore the issue a little bit further and decide what we’re going to do”. Rudi Völler, the men’s national team director at the German football federation, has confirmed Havertz will miss their World Cup qualifiers against Slovakia and Northern Ireland and said surgery remained a possibility for the 26-year-old. “He certainly won’t make it, he has a knee injury,” Völler said. “We don’t know exactly how it will go in the coming weeks, whether surgery is upcoming or it will be treated conservatively.” Havertz was sidelined from early February to mid-May last season after a hamstring tear at a training camp in Dubai. Fears that his latest injury could result in another lengthy layoff is believed to have prompted Arsenal to follow through on their longstanding interest in Eberechi Eze, who could make his debut at Anfield after his £67.5m move from Crystal Palace. Bukayo Saka is also expected to be absent against Liverpool and from England’s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia after sustaining a hamstring injury against Leeds. That is not as significant as initially feared, with the 23-year-old understood not to have needed to see a specialist, although Saka is likely to be out for about three to four weeks. The captain, Martin Ødegaard, is a doubt for the trip to Anfield after injuring a shoulder but he has been called up by Norway for World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Moldova. Arsenal are interested in signing Piero Hincapié from Bayer Leverkusen but need to sell fringe players before pressing ahead with a deal for the Ecuador defender, who is capable of playing as a left-sided centre‑back or left-back. He has a release clause of €60m (£52m) and is believed to be keen to join. Arsenal have already spent about £250m this summer and hope to make sales before the window closes on Monday. Porto have offered a loan deal for Jakub Kiwior with an obligation to buy for €25m (£21.5m) and the Poland defender is believed to have his heart set on a move away from the Premier League despite interest from English clubs. Porto have also shown interest in Oleksandr Zinchenko, whileand Fábio Vieira and Reiss Nelson could leave in the coming days.

55) Football transfer rumours: Kobbie Mainoo to consider Manchester United exit? — The Guardian (2025-08-26)

     Let’s start with a disclaimer: today’s Rumour Mill may contain some Manchester United. Because, as has been the case for at least 11 years now, everyone knows United are just two or three signings away from being a real force – promise! Except, if Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe is to sanction any more incomings this summer, they will be very late additions, as shipping players out of Old Trafford is an urgent priority. Rasmus Højlund looks to be en route to Napoli where he will, no doubt, channel his inner Scott McTominay and emerge as Ballon d’Or-contending world-beater. RB Leipzig, Atalanta and Milan are also lurking with intent around the Dane, but Naples on a loan-with-option-to-buy style deal is the likeliest destination. We are all told Alejandro Garnacho will join Chelsea but time is running out for him to actually join Chelsea. Antony has long been expected to return to Real Betis, but apparently Bayern Munich are mulling over a shock swoop for the Brazilian. And Kobbie Mainoo is the latest of United’s hitherto hyped youngsters to be linked with the exit, with some reports claiming at least 10 clubs have been alerted to the midfielder’s situation. Mainoo has played zero minutes so far this season and is considering his next move. Away from Old Trafford, Newcastle’s pursuits of Yoane Wissa and Jørgen Strand Larsen continue apace, a pace possibly hastened by Anthony Gordon’s red card against Liverpool and forthcoming suspension. There’s another striker who may leave St James’ Park for the Reds before the window SLAMS shut on 1 September, but his name escapes us. Chelsea are finally shedding themselves of some unwanted talent. Unlike Jadon Sancho, Tyrique George doesn’t consider a switch to Roma beneath him; Axel Disasi might fancy Bournemouth but whether anyone fancies Raheem Sterling or Ben Chilwell remains to be seen. The Blues are waiting to see if RB Leipzig want Christopher Nkunku back and, if they do, Xavi Simons will move in the opposite direction. Speaking of Leipzig, they could come in for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott in the next couple of days. Kostas Tsimikas is another heading for the Anfield exit door with Roma – perennially and mercifully picking up the Premier League’s old bits and pieces – set to land the left-back on loan. Wrexham are keen to further flex their muscles in the market and have reportedly opened talks with Rennes for the Wales international Jordan James. Southampton’s Will Smallbone, valued at £7.5m, is also on their shopping list. Finally, where next for Jamie Vardy? The Red Bull-swilling snipesman remains without a club after leaving his beloved Leicester and, despite having been touted for Celtic (it would make sense), he could now be set for the Serie A new boys Cremonese. The Vardy Party is going global! Maybe.

1) Brutal Escalation of Large-Scale Russian Federation Attacks on Ukraine Setting Grim Casualty Records, Jeopardizing Fragile Diplomatic Momentum, Security Council Hears — UN Press (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Warning that the Ukrainian people caught in the crossfire are “entering the fourth winter of the full-scale war”, a top UN official told the Security Council today that the Russian Federation’s large-scale escalation of attacks against civilians persist, killing children, setting grim casualty records and jeopardizing fragile diplomatic momentum.
     Miroslav Jenča, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas at the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the Secretary-General on Thursday condemned Moscow’s deadly overnight missile and drone attacks.  “Yesterday’s strikes are only the latest in the brutal escalation of country-wide aerial attacks,” he said.
     Ukrainian officials reported that, between 27 and 28 August alone, 598 drones and 31 missiles were launched, killing at least 23 people in Kyiv, including 4 children.
     Mr. Jenča stressed the expanding scope of violence, saying these strikes targeted regions far from the front lines.  “In July, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded rising civilian casualties across 18 regions of Ukraine,” he told the 15-member Council, with July setting a record of 1,674 casualties — the highest since May 2022.
     Since the invasion began, 14,054 civilians, including 730 children, have been killed, while more than 36,000 have been injured, he said, also acknowledging the conflict’s spillover into the Russian Federation where there have been civilian casualties in Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk.
     On 24 August, “a fire broke out after a Ukrainian drone was shot down near the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant”, damaging a transformer, he said. While the UN could not verify all reports of Ukrainian strikes inside the Russian Federation, Mr. Jenča cautioned: “The growing impact of the conflict on the civilian population in the Russian Federation is of concern, too.”  All attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure violate international humanitarian law, he reiterated.
     Underscoring that preparations are under way to provide targeted winter support for 1.7 million people in need, he stressed:  “Scaled up and flexible donor support is urgently needed” to continue to provide life-saving operations.
     Mr. Jenča also welcomed recent meetings in Anchorage and Washington, D.C., but warned that, as large-scale attacks against civilians persist, “the current diplomatic momentum is at risk of rapidly fading”.  He closed by reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire one that fully upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
     In the ensuing discussion, Council Members condemned the Russian Federation’s latest attack on Ukraine, with Slovenia’s delegate emphasizing that Moscow’s second-largest air assault of the war on 28 August saw 620 drones and missiles launched mostly at Kyiv, destroying residential buildings and damaging the European Union delegation and British Council premises.  These are “not military targets”, but densely populated areas, she stressed.
     The delegate of France also condemned in the “strongest possible terms” Moscow’s latest strikes, calling them “unacceptable”.  Recalling that President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has “shown his availability to implement an immediate, unconditional ceasefire” and willingness to engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, he said that Moscow has instead responded with more deadly strikes.  “Russia says it believes in peace and diplomacy; such brutal attacks say the opposite,” the delegate from the United Kingdom added.
     Other Council members underscored how the war in Ukraine was affecting regions beyond Europe, with the Republic of Korea’s representative voicing concern over the ongoing Moscow–Pyongyang military cooperation that is exacerbating the war’s severity and its bleak ramifications.  Algeria’s delegate noted the conflict’s impact on food and energy markets causing soaring prices in her country, region and beyond.  “The cost of this conflict, while borne most heavily by the Ukrainian people, is also being paid by the entire region and global community,” added Guyana’s speaker, echoing calls for an urgent intensification of diplomatic dialogue to end the conflict.
     “The Ukraine issue is entering a critical stage for negotiated settlement,” stated China’s delegate.  He welcomed ongoing talks, noting the continued engagement of all relevant parties towards a solution, expressing hope that the parties concerned will “meet each other halfway and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiation”.
     The United States representative stated that, in recent weeks, Washington, D.C., has undertaken “exceptional efforts to bring the Russian-Ukrainian war to an end”.  On 15 August, President Donald J. Trump met face to face with President Putin in Alaska — the first summit-level meeting between the two countries since Moscow launched its invasion over three years ago.  Building on that progress, President Trump then hosted President Zelenskyy and seven other European leaders at the White House on 18 August.
     However, the latest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine “cast doubts on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace”, he pointed out, underscoring that such strikes on civilian areas must stop immediately.  “Russia must decide now to move towards peace,” he asserted, urging the leaders of both countries to agree to meet bilaterally, warning of further economic measures with “far-reaching consequences” should Moscow choose to prolong the war.
     The speaker for the Russian Federation dismissed Western accusations as a “fairly primitive template” over its 28 August strikes, insisting its attacks targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex”, including arms depots, airfields and UAV factories, not civilians.  Rather, civilian deaths resulted from Ukrainian air defences placed in residential areas, he said, accusing Kyiv of “shamelessly and criminally” using Ukrainians as “human shields”.  The tragedies are being “intentionally whipped up to blame the deaths of Ukrainian civilians on Russia” to secure more Western arms and sanctions, he said.  Moscow further accused the West of hypocrisy, ignoring Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian cities that killed and wounded scores of civilians in late August.
     He also alleged rampant corruption and repression inside Ukraine, citing reports of political prisoners, restrictions on the Orthodox Church and off-shore assets tied to President Zelenskyy’s circle.  He said the West’s selective blindness undermines its credibility, while reiterating demands for security guarantees that address the Russian Federation’s concerns.  He accused Kyiv of “skyrocketing human rights violations”.  Referring to the Alaska Summit, he said his Government remains open to negotiations, but only on terms that exclude North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion and recognize Russian Federation interests, accusing Kyiv of blocking compromise and pursuing “PR over diplomacy”.
     Yulia Svyrydenko, Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the Council that the Russian Federation’s 28 August assault marked one of the deadliest nights of the war, with “629 airborne weapons” launched against cities, killing 25 people — including 4 children — and wounding 63 others.  Among the victims was a girl “not yet three years old, born under Russian shelling in October 2022, and killed by Russian shelling in August 2025”, she said.  The strikes, which also damaged the European Union Delegation and British Council premises, were “deliberate acts of terror”, she said, demanding stronger air defence and long-range capabilities to protect civilians, alongside tougher sanctions to deprive Moscow of funds for its war.
     Prime Minister Svyrydenko also highlighted the Russian Federation’s systematic abduction of children, citing cases of forced adoption and identity erasure.  “Russia kills children from a distance with missiles and drones, and those who fall under its control it steals,” she said.  She urged the Council to act, insisting that peace requires both bolstering its defence and intensifying pressure on Moscow until it shows genuine willingness to negotiate.  “Aggression must be punished, never rewarded,” she declared, reaffirming readiness for a just, lasting peace based on sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law.
     Several European countries took to the floor, as well, expressing support for Ukraine and condemning the Russian Federation’s attacks, with Poland’s speaker stating that, if Moscow hopes to break the spirit of resistance and solidarity, it is “gravely mistaken”.  “Recent strikes only strengthen our determination to support Ukraine,” he said, urging allies to impose restrictive measures that will further undercut Moscow’s revenues and weaken its capacity to wage war.
     “Putin does not seek even a temporary ceasefire, let alone a lasting peace,” said Estonia’s delegate, speaking also for Latvia and Lithuania.  She stressed that the Russian Federation must be held fully accountable for the crime of aggression and “for every war crime committed”.  Perpetrators must face justice, including through a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression.  “There can be no lasting peace without accountability,” she added.
     “Once again, Russia has demonstrated its complete disregard for civilian lives — and diplomatic missions,” said Norway’s delegate, speaking also for Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden.  Citing a ceasefire as “the necessary first step”, he noted that Ukraine has been ready for a ceasefire for several months while “Russia stands in the way”. However, peace in Ukraine cannot be negotiated without Ukraine’s participation, and “security guarantees will be needed”, he stressed, adding that the people of Ukraine require peace in accordance with international law, “not a pause for Russia to prepare for renewed aggression”.
     The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, said that, as high-level talks for peace are ongoing, Moscow has launched yet another massive and brutal overnight attack against Ukrainian cities and civilians.  Ordinary civilians — including children as young as two years old — have paid the ultimate price of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and illegal aggression.  “Such blatant violations of international law and the inviolability of diplomatic premises only strengthen our resolve to stand with Ukraine and its people,” he asserted.
     “The latest missile attack on Kyiv on 27 August is not a mistake,” stressed Romania’s delegate, adding that it was followed less than 24 hours later by a drone attack on a Ukrainian ship on the Danube Delta, near the Romanian border and near the Black Sea.  “These continuous attacks are not the path to peace.  And we need peace,” he emphasized.
     In the aftermath of the latest attacks, said Germany’s delegate, “we have to ask ourselves:  What is Russia’s intention?”  For weeks and months, that country’s leaders and diplomats have been claiming to seek negotiations and peace.  But, at the same time, they relentlessly launch rockets into residential areas of Ukraine.  Underscoring the need to respect the territorial integrity of UN Member States, he said Berlin — together with its allies — will support Ukraine in its right to defend itself “as long as it takes”.  He stated:  “Every night the people of Ukraine have to spend in fear is one too much.  It is time to act.”

2) Marine Biodiversity Treaty’s Preparatory Commission Concludes Second Session as Mounting Ratifications Raise Stakes for Intersessional Work — UN Press (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The commission tasked with preparing for the entry into force of a new treaty on marine biodiversity concluded its second session today, with delegates taking stock of the extensive negotiations held over the last two weeks and committing to doing “homework” before its third session to ensure that the treaty can be operationalized with appropriate financial and institutional mechanisms.
     The gathering, formally known as the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”, was held from 18 to 29 August.  Its first session was held from 14 to 25 April, and its third will convene from 23 March to 2 April 2026.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     The Agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023.  During today’s meeting, the Chair announced that Saint Kitts and Nevis ratified the treaty, becoming the fifty-fourth country to do so.  (The European Union has also ratified.)  Further, Ukraine signed the Agreement today, bringing the total number of signatures to 141.  The Agreement will enter into force 120 days after the date of deposit of the sixtieth instrument of ratification, approval, acceptance or accession thereto and, per its terms, the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties shall be convened no later than one year after the Agreement’s entry into force.
     In closing statements, delegates looked forward to this milestone, with Co-Chair Janine Coye-Felson (Belize) noting that this “does put the pressure of time on all of us”.  She called for an open exchange, a focus on key issues and continued support, adding:  “I have a begging bowl out.”  Her fellow Co-Chair Adam McCarthy (Australia) noted the importance of not leaving the Commission overloaded at its third session, adding that “by and large, we have been very, very successful in that regard”.  He said:  “We have a Convention that will be entering into force end of December, start of January [2026].” and a first Conference of the Parties sometime towards the end of 2026.  Therefore, “our work has become more intensified than it ever was; the time-bound nature of it is more clear than it’s ever been”, he stressed.
     Speaking for the Core Latin American Group, the representative of Colombia stressed the need to circulate — before the Commission’s next session — a draft decision on the institutional arrangements for the functioning of the Agreement’s secretariat, also reiterating the need to set a deadline on the dissemination of information concerning headquarters proposals.  The third session should seek to adopt consensus recommendations regarding the seat of the secretariat’s headquarters, she said.
     Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking for the African Group, called for the early release of revised drafts.  A revised draft text on terms of reference, modalities and rules of procedure for all subsidiary bodies will facilitate the swift operationalization of the Agreement upon its entry into force, she underscored.  Further, she called on the Co-Chairs to identify the relevant tasks that can be done intersessionally to “facilitate maximum progress at the next session”.
     The representative of Palau, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said:  “We had hopes that that we would have achieved more.”  She expressed disappointment over attempts to undermine the recognition of the special circumstances of small island developing States — this is a legal obligation under the Agreement and cannot be treated as an afterthought.  Calling on the international community to transform the Agreement “from a vessel of promise into one equipped for effective implementation”, she said that small island developing States are not just passengers on this vessel; “we are powering its movement, paddling alongside others to propel us towards entry into force”.
     Along similar lines, Tuvalu’s representative, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, emphasized that “the special circumstances of small island developing States must guide the work of this Agreement”.  Tonga’s representative, speaking for the Pacific Islands Forum, urged delegations’ flexibility so that the Commission can finish its work in a timely manner.  “We need to be clear-eyed about the likely limited time remaining until the entry into force of the Agreement and the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties,” she stressed.
     The European Union’s representative, in its capacity as observer, underlined the importance of efficiency, cautioned against reopening the Agreement and added:  “We want the majority of the resources that we invest in this Agreement to be directed to the purpose of the Agreement.”
     The Commission also heard from Vladimir Jares, Director of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, who updated delegates on the current financial state of the voluntary trust fund.  That fund has helped 30 delegations from developing countries — 27 of whom hailed from least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States — participate in the Commission’s work.  He noted that two delegates cancelled at the last minute due to personal reasons, and “the Division, mindful of its fiduciary responsibilities, is working with them to ensure the return of the advances that were provided”. As of 28 August, the trust fund had an estimated balance of $50,000, he reported.
     On that, Colombia’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, noted that the Group is composed of “very small delegations” — sometimes consisting of only one person.  “We really do depend on the voluntary trust fund,” she emphasized, expressing regret that several members’ applications to benefit from it were denied.  As such, she urged those able to contribute to the trust fund to do so.
     In the morning, the Commission again took up the rules of procedure for meetings of the Conference of the Parties, guided by a compilation of draft rules prepared by the Co-Chairs (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.3 ).  Among the topics they discussed were the rules governing the participation of observers in the Conference of the Parties and in the meetings of the Agreement’s subsidiary bodies, for which the draft document offered three different options.
     Singapore’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said that the “broad, by-default approach that is set out in option I” may not strike a balance between transparency and the prudent use of limited time and resources.  Stressing the need for efficient functioning of the Agreement’s procedures, he said that the provisions outlined in options II and III “would not be unduly restrictive” while permitting a high degree of transparency.
     Morocco’s representative, speaking for the African Group, stressed the need for “a transparent accreditation process based on consensus or the absence of objections”.  The group does not favour option I, which is “too open-ended and mixes categories”.  However, he said that the Group is “open to refining” option II, which is “more detailed and addresses a number of concerns”, and option III, which is “inspired by the practice of the Economic and Social Council and could represent a workable balance”.  The representative of China also said that “we cannot accept option I”, while expressing support for option II and flexibility on option III.
     The representative of the Philippines, however, expressed support for option I, adding that “the no-objection element — which allows for the possibility of a single State vetoing the participation of [a non-governmental organization] in options II and III — seem contrary to the spirit of article 48 of the Agreement [which concerns transparency]”.
     Along similar lines, the Republic of Korea’s representative, also opposing options II and III, agreed that they are not consistent with article 48 of the Agreement — which is “intended to promote transparency and to ensure that observer participation is not unduly restricted”.  She pointed out that options II and III would also require Parties to consider requests for observer participation, which “would not be an efficient use of limited time”.
     The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed that observer participation and broad representation of diverse stakeholders at the Conference of the Parties and the Agreement’s subsidiary bodies “ensures that a wide variety of knowledge — which is often specialized and technical — is available to ensure that decisions are taken on the best available science”.  Further, observers can provide “a critical and necessary countervoice” to those of State Parties.  The Commission is not only bound to facilitate observer participation, but also to avoid provisions that limit observer access “or suggest that observer participation is a privilege” and not a right, he said.
     Delegates also considered the upcoming ninth replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility, with the aid of a document prepared by the Co-Chairs titled “Elements of possible provisional guidance to the Global Environment Facility ninth replenishment process”.
     The United Kingdom’s representative affirmed that her delegation was “absolutely fine” with that document, urging colleagues to support it.  She further called on delegates involved in the Global Environment Facility’s Council “to speak to their colleagues working in that forum, as well, and to reinforce the importance of this process to all of us”.
     However, Brazil’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, said that the Commission “did not have time to fully debate the Elements document”.  She added that this is “not a trivial matter”; it touches upon substantive matters related to the Agreement’s implementation.  Such detailed programming direction should be given by the Conference of the Parties after thorough debate on the operationalization of the special fund, she said.
     It was then decided that the Commission will not provide any provisional guidance to the ninth replenishment process of the Global Environmental Facility.
     Also today, Chile’s delegate reported on the “BBNJ First Movers Initiative”, which is being led by 10 countries, including his.  That initiative is a voluntary space to share experiences and promote international partnerships to support the development of marine protected areas in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  He stressed the need “to consolidate the portfolio of marine protected areas in the high seas as soon as possible”.
     The Preparatory Commission will resume its work at its third session in 2026.

   Text:
     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
     ** Guest Today
     Just in a short while, I will be joined by Edem Wosornu who is as you know is the Director of Operations and Advocacy at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and she will be here to brief you on her recent visit and travels to Sudan and Chad.
     ** Secretary-General’s Travels
     Speaking of travels, later tonight, the Secretary-General will travel to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Leaders’ Summit taking place in Tianjin.  At the summit, on Monday, the Secretary-General will address the "SCO-plus" session.  He’s expected to recall that as we are moving towards a multipolar world, we need to strengthen multilateralism, uphold the rule of law, and deliver for people – as reflected in the Pact for the Future.  He is expected to underline the unique position of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to help shape a more inclusive and sustainable future.
     While in Tianjin, the Secretary-General is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with President Xi [Jinping], the President of the People’s Republic of China, as well as with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, Wang Yi.  He is also expected to have a number of other bilaterals with leaders attending the meeting. We will share an update on those bilaterals as they happen.
     On Tuesday, 2 September, the Secretary-General will arrive in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.  At the invitation of Prime Minister James Marape, the Secretary-General will take part in events to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Papua New Guinea’s independence.
     On Wednesday, 3 September, the Secretary-General is scheduled to deliver an address to the Parliament, during which he will highlight how in just 50 years, in a land of over 800 languages and countless traditions, the people of Papua New Guinea have undertaken the task of forging a nation from profound diversity, with a shared commitment to speak with one voice for peace, for dignity and for progress.
     He will also emphasize that this is his first trip to the Pacific since the landmark advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) — in which the region played a central role.  You will recall that the opinion affirms that addressing the climate crisis is a legal obligation under international law. And finally, just to note that this will be the first visit to Papua New Guinea ever by a sitting UN Secretary-General. The Secretary-General will be back in New York on 6 September.
     ** Deputy Secretary-General/Chile
     Our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, is in Santiago, Chile at the invitation of the Government.  This morning, she delivered remarks at the World Summit on Teachers, organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Government of Chile.  Ms. Mohammed highlighted the future of teaching in the age of Artificial Intelligence, the global shortage of teachers, and the ongoing education financing crisis.  She also spoke about the challenges faced by teachers in conflict settings.
     The Deputy Secretary-General stressed that quality education is the foundation of everything the world hopes to achieve through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda:  healthy lives, a healthy planet, opportunities, a sense of belonging, equality and peace.  She also emphasized that, without teachers, none of it is possible, adding that teachers are the beating heart of education, the cornerstone of sustainable development and the guardians of our future, and we must support them.
     While in Santiago, she held bilateral meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, Alberto van Klaveren Stork, and with Minister for Education of Chile, Nicolás Cataldo Astorga.  She also met with the UN country team, as well as youth and civil society representatives, listening to their perspectives on their priorities, challenges, and opportunities around sustainable development, human rights, and partnerships.  Ms. Mohammed will be back in New York City tomorrow.
     ** Gaza
     In remarks delivered to you this morning, the Secretary-General said that Israel’s initial steps to militarily take over Gaza City signals a new and dangerous phase.  Expanded military operations in Gaza City will have devastating consequences, he warned. Mr. [António] Guterres said that the levels of death and destruction in Gaza are without parallel in recent times.  Famine is no longer a looming possibility — it is a present-day catastrophe, he added. The Secretary-General said that starvation of the civilian population must never be used as a method of warfare.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     And turning to the situation actually on the ground as we speak in Gaza, our humanitarian colleagues are deeply concerned about the risk of a looming Israeli offensive on additional parts of Gaza City.  Some neighbourhoods have already seen deadly attacks in recent days.  Our humanitarian colleagues say the impact of a full-blown offensive would be beyond catastrophic — not only for those in the city but for the entire Gaza Strip.
     Our colleagues tracking population movements report that about 1,300 people fled from northern to southern Gaza yesterday and today. That brings the total number of north-south movements since 14 August — which is the day the plan for the offensive was announced — to 20,000.  Displacement is also happening within the north itself.  Altogether, since 14 August, some 60,000 displacements originating from Gaza City have been recorded.
     Across the Gaza Strip, hundreds of thousands of families continue to live in overcrowded, undignified and unsafe conditions at displacement sites.  Today, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Executive Director, Cindy McCain, called for faster approvals to move supplies into and within Gaza, as well as for safety for people to reach aid, and for humanitarian workers to reach those who need support.  Ms. McCain also made this statement after visiting the Gaza Strip, where she saw the destruction and desperation firsthand.
     With famine now confirmed in Gaza Governorate, Ms. McCain called for the right conditions to be put in place so WFP can reinstate its vast network of 200 food-distribution points, community kitchens and bakeries. She visited a nutrition clinic that’s keeping children alive and spoke with displaced mothers who described their daily struggle to survive, often searching for scraps of food but finding nothing.  As WFP noted, there has been a moderate increase in the amount of humanitarian and commercial goods entering the Strip.  But, this is still far below what’s needed to support 2 million people, many of them in extreme hunger.
     On a positive note, yesterday, for the first time since March, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was able to provide vital animal feed to herders in Deir al Balah.  They announced that 200 herders received two 100-kilogramme sacks each — a crucial step to protect livestock and help curb the spread of famine.
     Meanwhile, OCHA says that delays and impediments of humanitarian movements within Gaza continue, with movements that are approved by Israeli authorities still taking hours to complete.  Teams have been left waiting on roads that are often dangerous, congested, or impassable.
     Between last Wednesday and this Tuesday, out of 89 attempts to coordinate movements with Israeli authorities across the Gaza Strip, only 59 per cent were facilitated.  Another 26 per cent were initially approved, but then impeded on the ground, 8 per cent were denied outright and 7 per cent had to be withdrawn by the organizers.  Among the 23 impeded movements, 5 were fully accomplished, including to collect supplies from crossings and medically evacuate patients. The remaining 18 missions were not fully accomplished.
     ** Lebanon
     And like all of you, we have just seen the Security Council adopt unanimously a new resolution that extends for a final time the mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as it was set out by resolution 1701 (2006) until 31 December 2026.  At the request of the Security Council, the Secretary-General will explore, by 1 June 2026, options for the future of the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) after the withdrawal of UNIFIL.  Acknowledging the changed situation on the ground and as requested by the Security Council, UNIFIL will continue conducting its operations in support of the implementation by the parties of resolution 1701 (2006) until the end of its mandate.
     On 31 December 2026, the Mission will start within one year to carry out its orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal, with the aim of making the Government of Lebanon the sole provider of security in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL’s liquidation will begin after the conclusion of the drawdown and withdrawal phase.  I can confirm to you that we will cooperate closely, obviously, with the Governments of Lebanon and Israel to ensure a safe and orderly transition in our area of operations.  The United Nations Department of Peace Operations (DPO) will also closely engage with the troop-contributing countries to coordinate UNIFIL’s forthcoming withdrawal. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting the parties in their efforts to fully implement resolution 1701 (2006) and take the necessary steps towards a permanent ceasefire and lasting stability for the people on both sides of the Blue Line.
     ** Ukraine
     Turning to Ukraine:  Today, the Secretary-General held a phone call with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  The Secretary-General and the President discussed the recent diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.  The Secretary-General stressed the importance of sustaining the diplomatic momentum and reaffirmed the United Nations’ principled position in support of a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire as a first step towards a just, comprehensive and sustainable peace for Ukraine, in line with the UN Charter, international law and relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  The Secretary-General further reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to continue to address Ukraine’s humanitarian needs on the ground and support recovery and reconstruction efforts.
     You will have seen that earlier this morning, we issued a statement in which the Secretary-General condemned the overnight missile and drone attacks by the Russian Federation on Ukrainian cities, which killed and injured many civilians, including children.  The Secretary-General stressed that attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure violate international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must end immediately.  That full statement was shared with you.
     And on the ground, Mattias Schmale, the Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator for Ukraine, also condemned the attacks, stressing that they highlight the constant danger facing civilians in Kyiv and cities across Ukraine. And I also have some more details about the situation on the ground from our teams there.  They tell us that at least 15 people were killed and 40 injured in the overnight attacks by the Russian Federation on the capital, Kyiv. According to authorities, the strikes destroyed a five-story building and damaged more than 100 residential buildings, a kindergarten, a shopping centre, media offices, the premises of humanitarian organizations, and also damaged the offices of the European Union Delegation and the British Council.  The Ukrainian Railway Company also reported damage to their facilities and intercity trains.
     Humanitarians and local authorities responded immediately. Humanitarian organizations provided psychosocial support and began registering impacted families for cash assistance, while local authorities arranged temporary shelter for people who lost their homes.
     Meanwhile, hostilities in front-line regions continue. Local authorities report that six people were killed and dozens injured yesterday and today.  Damage to civilian infrastructure was also reported in the regions of Kherson, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro.  In the region of Vinnytsia, authorities reported that strikes on energy infrastructure left some 60,000 households without electricity across 30 towns and villages.  This follows earlier attacks on energy facilities in six regions, heightening the concerns ahead of winter.  And in Donetsk, nearly 200 people, including 50 children, were evacuated over the past days due to escalating fighting.
     ** Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
     A number of you this morning have asked me about the letter sent from France, Germany and the United Kingdom to the President of the Security Council in accordance with resolution 2231 (2015).  I can tell you that the Secretary-General is aware that today [28 August], the Security Council received this joint letter from the three countries.
     The Secretary-General urges the JCPOA participants and the Security Council to continue negotiations to find a diplomatic solution that ensures the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme and brings about economic benefits to the people of Iran.  In the next 30 days, there is a window of opportunity to avoid any further escalation and find a way forward that serves peace.  The Secretary-General welcomes any efforts towards that end.  He also underscores the imperative to exert all efforts to prevent a renewed military conflict and calls for prioritizing dialogue to address concerns related to Iran’s nuclear programme and broader regional security.
     ** Haiti
     This morning, if you remember that far, the Secretary-General briefed a Security Council session on the humanitarian situation in Haiti. The people of Haiti, he said, are in a perfect storm of suffering, he said as he reminded Council members that the country remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded.  Turning to the plight of children.  The Secretary-General said children are bearing the brunt of this crisis.  They are abducted, they are killed, they are recruited and they are used, and they are subjected to horrific sexual violence, including gang rape.  These are crimes that scar bodies, minds and futures, he told Council members.
     On the political situation, the Secretary-General noted emerging signals of hope.  He urged the Council to act without delay and authorize an international force, supported by the United Nations through logistical and operational backing and predictable financing.  Voluntary contributions to the Multinational Security Support Trust Fund remain essential, but assessed support would ensure impact and sustainability, he said.
     Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s Executive Director, also briefed and said one of the defining features of the crisis in Haiti is the rampant rights violations against children.  She asked Council members to use all available leverage to protect children, and to demand that all armed groups end attacks on schools and hospitals, immediately release children from their ranks and allow secure, unimpeded access for humanitarian workers to safely reach communities.  And she called on donors to show solidarity with the Haitian people and contribute to funding appeals.  And as you will recall, Haiti is the least funded of all of our humanitarian appeals.
     ** Sustainable Development Goals Advocates
     Also just to announce that the Secretary-General welcomes two new SDG Advocates:  Masai Ujiri, Co-Founder of Giants of Africa and former Vice-Chairman and President of the Toronto Raptors, and also appointed Muniba Mazari, an award-winning advocate for disability rights, inclusion and gender equality.  Mr. Ujiri uses basketball as a transformative tool to create opportunities for youth across Africa and beyond.  And Ms. Mazari uses her voice and platform to champion marginalized communities.  Our Advocates for the SDGs are influential leaders who support the Secretary-General in raising global ambition and action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The group is chaired by Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados.  That’s it.  Gabriel?
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  On the JCPOA, you know we have this 30-day window, as you alluded to.  We all know what happens at the end of September here. Is the Secretary-General thinking… what's his thinking in terms of perhaps convening some diplomacy under his good offices, when all the world leaders are here before that 30-day deadline kicks in?
     Spokesman :  I'm sure this will be an issue raised in a number of bilateral that the Secretary-General will have.  The decision now is up to Security Council members, but I think as I've just stated, there is that window, right? And we hope that all JCPOA participants will use that window to avoid any further escalation.
     Question :  And on UNIFIL, if I may, we've all read the resolution, so I'm not going to ask specifically about that.  But, what is the SG's thinking in terms of 2027?  Is that the wind-down period for the entire year, or how does he view that year?
     Spokesman :  Yeah.  I mean, it goes you know, the mandate will end at the end of 2026, then there is a withdrawal period and then the liquidation period.  I mean, it's sort of standard operating procedure.  We saw it with our Mission in Mali.  That being said, he will present, very soon, options to the Council on how to continue to implement 1701.  I mean, UNIFIL is a key element at this moment in the implementation of 1701.  And as we tell you every day, almost every day, there's progress being made, right?  I mean, the weapons caches, this stability, more or less, but more than less, along the Blue Line since the November ceasefire was agreed upon.  Dezhi?
     Question :  Also on UNIFIL, today in the Security Council chamber, we heard some Member States, they said that some of the mandates of UNIFIL haven't yet to be met, have been failed to meet.  And also Israeli Government obviously criticized UNIFIL also failing of, you know, disarm Hizbullah.  So, I just sort of want to know, what is the Secretary-General's reaction on this?
     Spokesman :  Well, the best way for UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate is for all parties in the conflict to allow it to fulfil its mandate.
     Question :  But oh, sorry… this Monday, I asked you that Secretary-General has a strong preference of not to end the operation, but you said it’s in the wise hands of these members of the Security Council to decide.  What does he think about this result?
     Spokesman :  Listen.  The Council… this is the organization that he runs, right?  The Security Council creates and de-creates peacekeeping missions. They've taken a decision, but let's look on the more positive side:  that there is an extension until the end of 2026.  There will be options presented to the Council on how to continue to implement 1701, because 1701 remains a very relevant resolution and it remains a very relevant part of our effort, along with the parties to bring stability to southern Lebanon.  Stefano Vaccara?
     Question :  Thank you, Stéphane.  This morning when the Secretary-General closed his speech on the stakeout, he says, no, you know, he said no more excuses, no more obstacles, no more lies. What can we know exactly what he was referring about the lies?  Who is…?
     Spokesman :  The truth is one of the first victims of war.  And what we've always repeatedly called for, especially in this conflict, is for journalists to be allowed in to report, to ensure that people know the truth about what is going on.
     Question :  But for the Secretary-General, what is the biggest lie that in this conflict has been?
     Spokesman :  I'm not going to start to rank disinformation.
     Question :  And then another question on what we just saw with the Russian Ambassador and what's going on with the Iran sanctions.  The Russian Ambassador at one point, answering a question, said that the action of Germany, France and UK is equivalent to gangsters.  Must say they’re just gangsters and doing what they're doing.  So, what is the Secretary-General’s opinion on what's going on with Iran in this moment about this issue of sanctions?
     Spokesman :  Well, I think I just shared it with you.
     Correspondent :  Yeah.  But, he's, in this case… I'm just saying, you know, the Russian calling the Germans gangsters…
     Spokesman :  I will be the last person to insert myself in the colourful dialogue between Security Council members.  Yes, please?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  I wanted to ask a slightly different question about the letter sent on behalf of more than 500 OHCHR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] workers to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, chief Volker Türk.  The letter urges the chief to publicly describe the war in Gaza as a genocide, saying his office's failure to do so undermines the global rights-protection system.  Just curious if there were any comments by the SG.
     Spokesman :  I think the High Commissioner has been extremely vocal, extremely strong about what was going on in Gaza.  I can tell you that he has the full and unconditional support of the Secretary-General.  As we've said here repeatedly, for the UN, the labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal authority.  And I think, if you look at the criticism that Mr. Türk has faced from the Israeli Government, I think that should give you a pretty good picture of his position on Gaza.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  And then we'll go to our guests.
     Question :  The US ambassador said that the US and Panama would table a draft resolution on the next Haiti force.  I wanted to know whether this new force is a replacement of the MSS or it's kind of a… what's the format of this new arrangement?
     Spokesman :  My understanding is that this isn't… listen.  Let me take a look at the… I misspoke yesterday when I answered a question on the Council in Iran.  I don't want to do it today, so I'll get you an answer on that.  Alright.  I'd like you to stay in your seats, and I will go get my guest.

4) Amid Relentless Armed Violence, Collapsing Schools, Hospitals, Haiti Facing ‘Perfect Storm of Suffering’, Secretary-General Warns Security Council — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     Amid relentless armed violence, collapsing schools and hospitals, and a worsening humanitarian crisis leaving millions at risk, the UN Chief warned the Security Council today that Haiti faces a “perfect storm of suffering”, with children enduring unprecedented levels of forced recruitment, sexual violence and hunger.
     “Civilians [in Haiti] are under siege,” said Secretary-General António Guterres, stressing that State authority is crumbling as gang violence engulfs Port-au-Prince and spreads beyond — paralysing daily life and forcing 1.3 million people to flee.  Reports detail rape and sexual violence, repeated attacks on hospitals and schools, and the collapse of the rule of law.  With 6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, Haiti ranks among the five global hunger hotspots of “highest concern”.
     Aid workers, especially local responders, face threats of violence, extortion and kidnapping.  Despite the danger, they continue delivering food, water, medicine and shelter — reaching 1.3 million people in the first quarter of this year alone. “Yet, Haiti remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded”, he stressed, noting that $908 million is required in 2025 to support 3.9 million people, yet less than 10 per cent has been received — making Haiti the least-funded humanitarian appeal worldwide. “This is not a funding gap.  It is a life-and-death emergency,” he asserted, urging donors to act before lifesaving operations grind to a halt.
     Citing his annual report on children and armed conflict, he said Haiti ranked among the top five countries for grave violations against children in 2024:  the UN verified 2,269 such violations against 1,373 children — nearly five times more than the previous year.  Children are being abducted, killed, recruited and subjected to horrific sexual violence, including gang rape.  “These are crimes that scar bodies, minds and futures,” he said.  With basic services collapsing and mass displacement worsening, children are left without education, healthcare, or safety.
     The 2024 Handover Protocol between the UN and Haiti’s Government is “an important step” towards protecting children detained for alleged association with armed groups, he said.  However, he warned of the growing threat posed by so-called community self-defence groups — some aligned with police forces — implicated in grave violations, including the summary execution of children.  He urged all authorities to implement the Handover Protocol nationwide.
     While the political situation remains fragile, there are “emerging signals of hope”, including increased cooperation between the President of the Transitional Presidential Council and the Prime Minister, who are leading consultations to advance the political process.  Coordinated international security support, he stressed, is essential to bolster national efforts, protect civilians and create conditions for a return to the rule of law and credible, inclusive elections.
     Welcoming efforts to advance his proposal to strengthen the Multinational Security Support mission through UN logistical and operational support, he urged the Council to swiftly authorize an international force with UN backing and predictable financing.  Security measures, he emphasized, “must go hand-in-hand with increased pressure on those fuelling the violence” through an effective arms embargo and targeted sanctions against gang leaders, financiers and arms traffickers.
     “With unity inside the country, and resolve from this Council, the Haitian people can emerge from the perfect storm, begin to turn hardship into hope, and reclaim their future,” he concluded.
     Presenting a detailed briefing on the grave and widespread violations of children’s rights, Catherine Russell, Executive Director, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said: “Haiti’s children continue to endure unimaginable suffering amidst the brutal armed violence.”  The recruitment and use of children by armed groups is rampant, she stressed, estimating that children currently account for a staggering 50 per cent of the armed groups’ members.  Children are being forced into combat roles, directly participating in armed confrontations, and subjected to appalling sexual violence that has reached “unprecedented levels”.
     In 2024, reported cases of sexual violence against children rose by 1,000 per cent over 2023, she noted, with over a quarter involving gang rapes.  “This constitutes a widespread campaign to terrorize communities and inflict lasting physical and psychological trauma on children,” she said, emphasizing that girls account for most victims and survivors.
     Amid this devastating reality, UNICEF and partners are being denied access to deliver humanitarian assistance.  Armed groups, she said, are preventing aid from reaching the 1.6 million children and women in areas under their control.  Last month, six UNICEF staff members were taken hostage during a lifesaving mission — although later released, the incident highlights the dangers humanitarian workers face.
     Despite these obstacles, UNICEF continues to deliver lifesaving aid.  So far this year, together with partners, it has treated 21,000 children for severe wasting, provided healthcare to 117,000 people and ensured access to safe water for 140,000.  “Today, I ask all Members of this Council to use all available leverage to protect children and to support concrete actions to prevent further violations,” she said.
     Silent Condemnation of Entire Generation of Children
     The Council then heard from Jean Jean Roosevelt, a musician and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, who stated that “armed violence is tearing Haiti apart like a broken guitar whose strings produce nothing but tears and cries”. With armed groups taking over entire neighbourhoods, “children now live in a symphony of fear; every alleyway turned into a dissonant note”.
     These children, he said, pay the heaviest price:  forcibly recruited, abused, and used as cannon fodder, as though their youth no longer held any value.  “Schools, once sanctuaries, have become minefields”, he added, with classrooms destroyed or turned into shelters for displaced families.
     Calling this reality “a silent condemnation of an entire generation”, he noted that over 1.5 million children lack regular access to education; 3.3 million — two out of three — depend on humanitarian aid; and 129,000 risk dying of hunger this year.  “Behind these figures that we repeat aloud over and over, there is a face, a name, a fragile dream:  perhaps that of a little girl who wanted to be a doctor or that of a boy who dreamed of playing the drum at carnival,” he said.  However, “these dreams are now suspended and suffocated”.
     “Let us act so that Haiti may once again have schools, hospitals, and safe spaces; so that children no longer live in fear, but in the promise of tomorrow”, he urged.  Addressing the Council, he pledged:  “The children of Haiti have sounded the alarm, raising a cry of urgency. Will you continue to answer it? For the time to come to their aid is not tomorrow, nor the day after… it is now.”
     In the ensuing debate, delegates voiced alarm over the plight of Haitian children, with the representative of Panama, President for August, speaking in his national capacity, saying:  “Every figure is a story that can still have a different outcome.  A recruited child that can go back to school, a girl who survives violence who can receive attention and justice; a baby with serious, acute malnutrition who can still recover if therapeutic milk reaches them in time; a displaced family that can live without fear.”  On the underfunding of the Haiti humanitarian response plan, he said:  “Not closing this gap is not just a technical statistical matter; it is literally the difference between life and death”.
     Guyana’s representative, also speaking for Algeria, Sierra Leone, and Somalia, echoed concerns over the “faltering” humanitarian response, amidst insecurity and access impediments.  “The situation is also compounded by the rising deportations of Haitian nationals, which place additional strain on already scarce resources,” she said, adding:  “Discussions on safety and security must also address challenges to the safety of humanitarian personnel and the continuity of aid operations.”
     Slovenia’s delegate concurred, pointing out that the growing presence and activities of armed gangs in Haiti’s key rice-basket region are fuelling famine-like conditions and record-high displacement.  Calling for safe humanitarian access to these areas, she said:  “Reducing the territorial control of armed gangs in urban hubs, agricultural areas, and along vital transport routes must be an immediate priority to enable and safeguard food production and its unimpeded transport and delivery.”
     Spotlighting the plight of children, the United States’ delegate echoed other speakers’ condemnation of their recruitment by armed gangs, and outlined measures taken by her country, including its designation of Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists.  Also commending the Council for its recent designation of those groups, she noted the $5 million reward offered for information leading to the arrest of gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, known as Barbecue.
     In a similar vein, the United Kingdom’s delegate pointed out that armed gangs are systematically recruiting minors, fuelling a surge in exploitation, sexual violence and abuse.  “These atrocities spread fear and inflict lasting trauma on Haiti’s young people,” he said, stressing the need to re-establish security for Haiti’s long-term stability and welcoming the Secretary General’s recommendations for enhanced security assistance for Haiti.
     The Dominican Republic’s representative said that Haiti is a litmus test for the Council’s credibility, pointing out that children comprise 30 to 50 per cent of the armed gangs’ ranks through forced recruitment. Emphasizing the need for political will and the restoration of security and the rule of law, he called for the Multinational Security Support Mission to be adequately resourced, for humanitarian assistance to be bolstered, and for the reintegration of minors linked to armed gangs to be guaranteed.
     On the political front, France’s delegate underscored that progress must be made towards a political transition and security conditions established for the holding of elections.  To this end, the Council should use all tools at its disposal, including sanctions, to combat gangs and the transnational criminal network fuelling them.
     Also on the topic, the Russian Federation’s delegate observed that the crisis in Haiti has left “simply no legitimate state authority to speak of”, while transitional mechanisms had not garnered requisite support from Haitians.  Therefore, conditions for the swift holding of elections and general elections in 2026 had not unfortunately been established.  In the areas around the capital, the State is de facto absent and parallel government structures flourish, leading to the intimidation and extortion of the Haitian people.
     The representatives of Greece, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea were among many speakers highlighting the need to support the Multinational Security Support Mission, with the latter calling for the acceleration of discussions on the Secretary-General’s recommendations to ensure they are reflected as concretely as possible in the upcoming resolution on the renewal of the Support Mission’s mandate.  “Only then can we provide the people of Haiti with the clarity and support they urgently need,” he said.
     For his part, China’s delegate called on Haitian authorities to increase security inputs and rationalize resource allocation.  While commending the Support Mission in helping improve the security situation, he called on the country that initiated it and bears primary responsibility for the situation in Haiti to continue to provide funding and support.
     The representative of Barbados, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), called for stronger backing of the Mission as well as the rapid implementation of the Haitian Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan.
     Haiti’s delegate pointed out that while his Government has mobilized resources to help over 200,000 of the most vulnerable families, this is still “largely insufficient”.  Agricultural production often fails to reach urban centers, exacerbating the crisis.  Resolving the humanitarian crisis is inextricably linked to addressing Haiti’s severe security challenges, he said, urging regional and international partners to prioritize support that enables displaced populations to return home and reduces their long-term dependence on aid.
     “The gravity of the situation in Haiti requires a coordinated, integrated and sustainable humanitarian response plan with adequate and sufficient resources to address the multiple challenges,” he stressed.

5) Nearing End of Second Session, Preparatory Commission for High-Seas Biodiversity Treaty Discusses Rules of Procedure, Cooperation Arrangements — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     On the penultimate day of its second session, the commission preparing for the entry into force of a new marine biodiversity treaty focused once again on the rules of procedure that will apply to meetings of its Parties, also considering cooperation arrangements with relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies.
     The gathering, formally known as the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”, is taking place at UN Headquarters from 18 to 29 August.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     That treaty was adopted on 19 June 2023 and is open for signature until 20 September 2025.  During the Commission’s meeting on 27 August, it was announced that the Republic of Moldova signed on 26 August and Cabo Verde ratified on 27 August, bringing the total number of signatories to 140 and the total number of ratifications to 54.
     In the morning, the Commission returned to the topic of the rules of procedure for meetings of the Conference of the Parties, guided by a compilation of draft rules prepared by the Co-Chairs (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.3 ).
     Among the many rules discussed, the representative of the Federated States of Micronesia — speaking for Pacific small island developing States — said that the one related to the submission of credentials “could do without the provision” allowing any person authorized by a Head of State, Head of Government or Foreign Minister to issue such credentials, as “it just complicates the procedure”.  On the examination of credentials, the Commission should “stay with precedent” and adhere to the General Assembly’s procedure in this regard, he said.
     However, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, expressed support for the addition of language allowing any person authorized by those high-level individuals to issue credentials to that rule, citing its use in the rules of procedure for the International Criminal Court’s Assembly of States Parties.  He also supported the original language on “examination of the credentials” as it reflects the UN General Assembly’s rules of procedure.
     On another issue — the Conference of the Parties’ Bureau — Argentina’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, favoured one comprising “a President and 15 Vice-Presidents”.  On whether members in arrears can serve on the Bureau, he noted that “issues related to arrears are already mentioned in the financial rules” and suggested referencing those rules instead of adding language to the rules of procedure.  The representatives of the United Kingdom and Norway voiced support for a provision on “penalties for arrears”, similarly noting that a cross-reference to the financial rules could be appropriate.
     Morocco’s representative, speaking for the African Group, said that the Bureau must be sufficiently sized to ensure equitable and inclusive representation — suggesting between 12 and 15 members to this end.  However, he stressed that any formula should not disadvantage “or weaken the voice of developing countries”.  “Our overall objective is a Bureau that is balanced, representative and effective,” he emphasized.
     The representative of the Federated States of Micronesia, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, proposed a Bureau with 17 Vice-Presidents — 15 from the regional groups, 1 from small island developing States and 1 from least developed countries.  Regarding the provision that the President shall not exercise the right to vote, he said that this is correct here.  However, he added that the States for whom he speaks feel differently about the subsidiary bodies, in which a President would be acting in a more personal capacity.
     Singapore’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, stressed that the rules for Bureau officers must “make clear that seats for small island developing States and least developed countries are in addition to the seats allocated to the regional groups”.  To that end, Japan’s delegate also voiced support for a Bureau with 3 members per regional group, plus 1 member each from small island developing States and least developed countries, comprising a total of 17 Vice-Presidents.
     China’s representative, too, expressed support for a Bureau of this size, with representation for small island developing States and least developed countries.  However, he also recommended that proportionality be considered, given “the big difference in the [number of] member States in each regional group”.  On the granting of credentials, he noted that — in the General Assembly’s rules of procedure — “there is no language allowing any other person to grant credentials” than the Head of State or Government or the Foreign Minister.  Allowing other persons to do so, he warned, would further complicate the work of the credentials committee, and give rise to questions around States’ internal procedures.
     For his part, Iran’s delegate supported the highest number allocated for Vice-Presidents in the draft rules, which “shall be from regional groups”.  Noting the draft’s reference to gender balance in the composition of these officers, he stressed that any such reference should be consistent with the Agreement. Regarding the draft provision that would exclude a party from Bureau membership due to arrears in contributions, he noted that it would be unfair to apply this to developing countries.
     The representative of Saudi Arabia called for deleting the entire provision “punishing countries with arrears, since this Agreement is to ensure strengthened cooperation and participation of all State Parties”.  The speaker for the Philippines added that “State Parties that are in arrears should not be deprived of their voting rights”.  Regarding the term limit for the President of the Conference of the Parties, she welcomed the option of a maximum of two — “because it is the clearest guarantee of fairness, inclusivity and rotation”.
     Delegations also addressed the Bureau’s role, underscoring its consultative function.  Türkiye’s representative noted redundant language in the proposed text, but expressed support for retaining the reference to Bureau members “regularly consulting with the Parties from their respective regional groups” in the interest of transparency and inclusiveness.  Noting the provision for a proportional allocation of seats among the UN regional groups, she cautioned that such a formula “could complicate the process and risk undermining inclusiveness — particularly for smaller regional groups”.
     Support for the allocation of special seats for small island developing States and least developed countries, given their unique circumstances, was heard throughout the meeting.  However, Switzerland’s representative stated that, “in principle, sub-groups should be part of the regional representation in the Bureau”, voicing concern that separate seats for sub-groups “would open a dangerous Pandora’s box”.
     While the Commission also addressed rules relating to subsidiary bodies later in the morning, it did not complete its full review of the revised draft rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties during this meeting.  Co-Chair Adam McCarthy (Australia) emphasized that “it is essential to complete this task” during the Commission’s current session, so that a further revised draft can be prepared during the intersessional period.
     In the afternoon, the Commission returned to the issue of cooperation arrangements with relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies.
     Argentina’s representative, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, was among those who underscored the role of the Conference of the Parties as the central governing body of the Agreement.  He stressed that, consequently, any cooperation mechanism must ensure that “it is the Conference of the Parties that preserves the coherence, control, oversight and political direction over coordination processes, consultations and technical exchanges carried out by subsidiary bodies with instruments, frameworks and bodies”.  Such activities must operate “within clear mandates emanating from the Conference of the Parties”, he added.
     There was also general support for the development of a draft decision or strategic framework on cooperation.  Tonga’s representative, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, proposed that the Preparatory Commission create such a draft decision and forward it to the Conference of the Parties for consideration and adoption.  She cautioned, however, against referring to such a document as “guiding principles”, as this may result in a negotiation exercise.
     Saint Lucia’s representative, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), added that a strategic framework in line with article 47 of the Agreement — which establishes the Conference of the Parties — would “ensure coherence across regimes, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure efficiency in the use of limited resources”.  The framework would capture the key thematic areas of cooperation, key actors for such collaboration and the various types of arrangements to this end.
     The representative of Côte d’Ivoire, speaking for the African Group, emphasized that cooperation modalities must be aligned with the Agreement’s unique objectives and legal obligations.  Further, they must effectively address the needs and priorities of African developing States, including least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.
     Palau’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, noted that “cooperation goes both ways” — therefore, any cooperation arrangement must be reciprocal.  For its part, the Commission could recommend that the Conference of the Parties invite representatives of relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies to become observers to the Agreement’s institutions.  It could also mandate that the Agreement’s secretariat develop cooperation arrangements, she added.
     The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, emphasized that the Agreement’s secretariat and subsidiary bodies should have significant autonomy when interacting with relevant instruments, frameworks and bodies, with any decision ultimately taken in this respect giving such bodies the flexibility they need to carry out their tasks.
     Following this discussion, the Co-Chairs confirmed that they intend to prepare a draft decision on this topic during the intersessional period for consideration at the Preparatory Commission’s third session.
     The Commission will reconvene on Friday, 29 August, to conclude its second session.

6) Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2790 (2025), Security Council Extends Mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon — UN Press (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16159.doc.htm
   Text:
     The Security Council today extended the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), for a final time until 31 December 2026, and decided that it should start an orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal from that date.
     Unanimously adopting resolution 2790 (2025) (to be issued as document S/RES/2790(2025) ), the Council also demanded the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), reiterated its strong support for full respect for the Blue Line and welcomed the November 2024 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon.
     In further terms, the 15-member organ, noting with grave concerns the continuous violations of this arrangement, including air and drone strikes on Lebanese territory, called on all parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.
     It called on the Government of Israel to withdraw its forces north of the Blue Line, including from the five positions held in Lebanese territory, and called on the Lebanese authorities to deploy on these positions with the timebound support of UNIFIL, and to extend the control of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory in accordance with relevant resolutions and accords, so that as soon as possible there will be no weapons besides those of and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon.
     In the ensuing discussion, that country’s delegate welcomed the mandate renewal, while adding:  “Lebanon still considers UNIFILS’s presence as essential to guarantee security” in the country and region, until a comprehensive political solution is reached.  Stressing the importance of the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from his country’s territory, he said the international community must support his Government in establishing its authority.
     The continued Israeli targeting of Lebanon, including its infrastructure and civilians, and the prevention of displaced persons from returning to their homes violates international law, he said — despite this, his Government has taken steps to assert full State authority over its territory.  He called on the Council to uphold its legal responsibility and hold Israel accountable for its violations; further, those countries that are guaranteeing the cessation of hostilities arrangement must compel Israel to respect it.  He also called on the UN and its agencies to provide comprehensive support to the Lebanese army and institutions, both bilaterally and multilaterally.
     On the other hand, the representative of Israel said that “UNIFIL has failed in its mandate”.  Its presence has not prevented Hizbullah from “building one of the world’s most dangerous arsenals”, overlooking vast military buildup discovered across southern Lebanon — “some alarmingly close to UNIFIL positions”. In its annual reporting, UNIFIL rarely names Hizbullah “and frequently downplays its activities”, he stated.
     “Israel will continue to do whatever is necessary to defend its people”, with the Israel Defense Forces maintaining presence at five strategic locations along the Blue Line, he stressed.  The Council has “ignored the root cause”, he said, calling on it to hold Iran accountable for “its unspeakable war crimes”.  He stressed the need for a new course that empowers the Lebanese State, holds Hizbullah and Iran to account and restores the authority of Council resolutions.  “After 47 years of what was meant to be an interim presence”, UNIFIL is concluding its mandate on the border between Israel and Lebanon — this is a “decisive moment for Lebanon, Israel and the region”, he stressed.
     Along similar lines, the delegate of the United States said that “the first ‘I’ in UNIFIL stands for interim”.  The time has come for UNIFIL’s mission to end, she said, adding that this is the last time her delegation will support an extension.  “The security environment in Lebanon is radically different” from what it was one year ago, she added, and there is now space for Lebanon to assume greater responsibility.  Her country will support Lebanon’s efforts to assume its security responsibilities, she said, voicing support for Israel’s right to defend itself.
     Despite voting in favour, several delegates expressed reservations.  Algeria’s delegate, who noted that UNIFIL was created in 1978 to observe and confirm Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, said:  “Has UNIFIL fulfilled its mandate?  Clearly the answer is no.”  Lebanese land remains under Israeli occupation, he said, highlighting Israel’s many violations of international law.  The Council must be ready to revisit this resolution considering future developments, he said, regretting that his delegation’s request to refer to the 1949 General Armistice Agreement was not retained.  China’s delegate regretted that “the stubborn insistence of a permanent member” has resulted in the last renewal of UNIFIL’s mandate.  No mission should withdraw in haste while the situation remains tense, he added.
     The Russian Federation’s delegate said the interests of the Lebanese were not fully reflected in this text and warned that it should not create a “security vacuum” in southern Lebanon.
     For the United Kingdom, that country’s delegate said, it was “disappointing that despite the best efforts of the penholder”, the 15-member organ was unable “to make this significant decision on the basis of an evidence-based assessment of the impact of UNIFIL’s withdrawal”.  Pakistan’s delegate reminded delegates that Lebanon did not request the withdrawal of UNIFIL.
     The representative of Greece added:  “While in principle we believe that the ending of the mandate should have been condition-based and the text is not ideal, we stress that UNIFIL’s transition needs to be safe and orderly in close coordination with the host country.”
     France’s delegate, who sponsored today’s resolution, said a premature withdrawal could undermine Beirut’s efforts.  However, he added, “the precious time” afforded by the mandate renewal will be crucial for Lebanon’s Government to assume its authority over its territory.  The representative of the Republic of Korea, a troop-contributor to UNIFIL, highlighted “the Lebanese Government’s sheer will to rise as the sole guarantor of its national security, which gave us confidence to vote in favour of this resolution”.  Also welcoming the text were the representatives of Denmark, Slovenia and Somalia, with the latter calling on Israel to cease its daily air and drone strikes.
     The representative of Panama, Security Council president for August, speaking in his national capacity, voiced strong support for UNIFIL’s peacekeeping personnel, whose presence has “contributed significantly to helping the Lebanese armed forces establish safer conditions for civilians.  Looking towards the last stage of the Force’s work, he expressed trust that conditions in southern Lebanon “will positively evolve towards lasting stability”.

7) Gaza’s Population Systematically Being Starved to Death, Speakers Warn Security Council, Demanding Immediate Ceasefire, End to Deliberate Famine — UN Press (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     The situation in Gaza is catastrophic, with the worst-case scenario of famine now officially declared and Israel using starvation as a method of war “in its starkest terms”, speakers warned the Security Council today, among them the head of Save the Children International, who implored, Gaza’s “children have reached their breaking point.  Where is yours?”
     “Today the world looks on in horror as the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to deteriorate to levels not seen in recent history,” said Ramiz Alakbarov, United Nations Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process.
     Twenty-two months into the hostilities, Gaza faces “rapidly mounting civilian casualties, mass displacement, and, now, famine”, he said. Moreover, hostages remain in “appalling conditions”, while the West Bank is gripped by “relentless expansion of settlements, demolitions, and intensifying violence”.
     Since 23 July, “at least 2,553 Palestinians were killed,” including 271 while trying to collect aid. Journalists are also under assault; 240 have been killed, including six during a 10 August strike.  And on 25 August, an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital killed 20 civilians.  “I reiterate the Secretary-General’s call for an independent and impartial investigation,” Mr. Alakbarov stressed.
     “Ending famine is a race against time,” requiring restoration of “water, sanitation, health services, and food production”, he continued. Israeli steps such as limited pauses and expanded supply approvals are “nowhere near sufficient”, he said, adding:  “All parties must allow rapid, safe, unimpeded, and large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid”.
     On hostages, he said that 50 remain in captivity and their ill-treatment and abuse constitute a blatant violation of international law.  Turning to the West Bank, he said that Government approvals for 3,400 housing units threaten the possibility of a viable and contiguous Palestinian State.
     “On 22 August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Famine Review Committee confirmed that famine is now occurring in Gaza,” Joyce Msuya, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, told the Council.
     Over half a million people currently face starvation, destitution and death,” with projections of 640,000 within weeks, she added.  At least 132,000 children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition, with over 43,000 at risk of death.  For pregnant and breastfeeding women, numbers are surging from 17,000 to 55,000.
     “It’s a created catastrophe,” she went on, citing 22 months of restricted aid, destroyed cropland and decimated livestock. Overcrowding and collapsed water and sanitation systems have also “turned menstrual hygiene into a nightmare for women and girls”.
     International law, she reminded, “prohibits the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”.  Turning to the West Bank, she echoed Mr. Alakbarov’s warning that “settler violence, and discriminatory policies” threaten 18 Bedouin communities with displacement.
     “As we speak children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death,” said Inger Ashing, Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children International.  The Gaza famine is a deliberate policy — engineered and manmade — in which Israel is using “starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms”.
     Clinics are “almost silent now”, filled with emaciated children who “do not have the strength to speak or even cry out in agony”, she said.  Supplies lie blocked at the border — “thousands upon thousands of truckloads of lifesaving items”.   Increasingly, children “wish for food, for bread”, and some wish “to be dead”, with one child writing:  “I wish I was in heaven where my mother is, in heaven there is love, there is food and water”.
     Ms. Ashing stressed that famine is “the predictable result of a policy of a sustained siege on food, medicine and fuel”, echoing Ms. Msuya’s assessment that at least 132,000 children under five are at risk of acute malnutrition — twice the number in May 2025.  “This is the predictable result of obstruction”, as non-governmental organizations face rejected requests and new registration rules that are “unlawful, unsafe, and incompatible with humanitarian principles”.  Gazan families are also now calling militarized food distribution points “the jaws of death”, she said.
     “Palestinian children are the only ones in the world systematically prosecuted in military courts,” she pointed out.  They report abuse and starvation while in custody.  For almost two years, the international community has failed to protect Palestinian children — who are now at their breaking point.  “Where is yours?” she asked Council members.
     Ilana Gritzewsky, held in captivity in Gaza for 55 days, spoke to the Council next, saying:  “I was born in Mexico to a Jewish family deeply connected to Israel”.  Ms. Gritzewsky had moved to Israel and lived with her partner, Matan, in Kibbutz Nir Oz.  On 7 October 2023 “that life was destroyed” when “terrorists stormed our home; Matan held the door as we hid, but they broke in”.
     “I was dragged away, beaten, humiliated, and taken to Gaza,” she recalled. For 55 days she endured captivity.  “I suffered broken bones, constant abuse, starvation.  We were given scraps of food while our captors ate full meals.  We were moved from house to house, then to tunnels,” she told Council Members. There she discovered that Matan had also been captured.
     Released after several weeks, Ms. Gritzewsky said she carries deep scars.  “Trauma doesn’t vanish once you are released,” she added.
     With Matan still in Gaza, she urged the Council:  Use your power to demand the unconditional release of every hostage now. “Only then can we begin to heal and believe again in the values this Council was created to uphold,” she said.
     The Observer for the State of Palestine said famine, now declared in Gaza City, is rapidly engulfing the entire Gaza Strip and “eating away at infants and children”.  He condemned the strike on Nasser Hospital as “premeditated”, targeting medics and journalists who had rushed to assist after the initial attack — calling it part of a broader plan to displace the Palestinian people and seize their land.
     Emphasizing that “the only path to a peaceful, stable, and secure future goes through Palestine”, he reaffirmed Palestine’s readiness to work with the United States, Saudi Arabia, France, and other international and regional partners to ensure post-ceasefire arrangements address all legitimate concerns in line with international law and relevant UN resolutions. “Palestine will not disappear.  Israel will not disappear.  No one can kill their way to peace,” he concluded.
     Amid the official declaration of famine in Gaza, many speakers sounded the alarm over Israel’s expansion of military operations in the Strip.
     “The famine that we have all feared is now a confirmed fact in Gaza City, and it is expected to affect more areas by September,” said Denmark’s delegate, urging Israel to immediately change course and allow immediate, large-scale, unobstructed multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance.
     “Over 100 children in Gaza have died of malnutrition, while food is sitting at Gaza’s borders,” said the United Kingdom’s delegate. Somalia’s delegate added that “entire families are starving in full view of this Council”, despite the presence of an international humanitarian system that could save them if “only they were allowed to act”.
     Picking up that thread, Greece’s delegate noted that her country, in coordination with the European Union, Jordan, and other regional partners, had recently conducted an airdrop of food supplies over Gaza.  She also welcomed the resumption of the Cyprus corridor, a critical component of the humanitarian pipeline, expressing hope it would accelerate the delivery of aid.
     China’s delegate reiterated that “violence cannot bring security”, citing the attack on Nasser Hospital as “yet another horrendous tragedy”.  He condemned the weaponization of humanitarian aid and the militarization of its distribution, urging Israel to fulfil its obligations as the occupying Power by opening all border crossings and fully restoring humanitarian access.
     The representative of the Russian Federation concurred, noting that during the Nasser Hospital attack, “a cynical double-tap strike was used when rescue workers arrived”.  He further warned against the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which he described as “a pseudo-humanitarian structure”, pointing out that since it began operating in May 2025, 1,800 Palestinians have died while trying to obtain assistance.
     The representative of Panama, Council President for the month, spoke in his national capacity to denounce the double strike at Nasser Hospital as “a dual direct affront on human dignity and international law”.
     France’s delegate added that such operations will “in no way” ensure Israel’s security”, while firmly rejecting all forced displacement of civilians in Gaza.
     Numerous Council members stressed that the attack at the Nasser Hospital formed part of a repeated pattern of strikes and the incessant killing of civilians, medical staff and journalists.
     With each Council’s convening to address the Gaza conflict, “we are confronted with new depths of suffering”, said Sierra Leone’s representative.  What is unfolding in Gaza, he stressed, constitutes not only a systematic pattern of atrocity crimes but also “a systematic assault on truth itself”.  The Secretary-General has been vilified simply for speaking the truth.  The UN and its agencies have faced baseless accusations, journalists and media workers have paid with their lives in unprecedented numbers, and medical personnel have been attacked in clearly marked facilities and ambulances, with independent experts describing it as “a war on healthcare”.
     Guyana’s delegate voiced concern over the fate of professionals in Gaza, highlighting that doctors and other medical staff lack access to Israeli visas, while many have been killed or injured in hospital attacks.
     Calling for full accountability, the Republic of Korea’s representative urged transparent, independent investigations into all possible violations of international humanitarian law.  “A mere inquiry is not enough”, he stressed, noting that “a series of investigations” has yielded “no concrete measures” since the war began.
     “The suffering in Gaza has reached a level of barbarity that defies imagination,” said Algeria’s delegate, asking:  “Will this Council persist as a theatre of lamentation, endlessly echoing speeches while Gaza burns for lack of action?”
     Warning that each day of inaction risks making the Council “complicit in the suffering that continues to unfold”, Slovenia’s representative similarly questioned:  “What military necessity can justify the killing of a journalist, a doctor, a humanitarian worker?”
     Describing the deliberate destruction of civilian life in Gaza as “mass carnage”, Pakistan’s delegate recalled that the Organization of Islamic Cooperation recently adopted a resolution urging the Council, with “moral clarity”, to act under Chapter VII to halt the aggression and violations by the Israeli occupation.
     While recognizing that “hunger is a real issue in Gaza”, the United States’ representative questioned the credibility of the recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report.  The international community has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into Gaza over the years, while turning a blind eye to the fact that it was facilitating Hamas’ creation of a terrorist stronghold.  The Israel Defense Forces concluded that six Hamas members were killed when it struck the site “Hamas was using to monitor troops at the hospital”, she added.
     Addressing Ilana Gritzewsky, Israel’s representative said:  “You are the living reminder of the unbearable suffering still endured by the hostages.” He noted that the recent report on sexual violence in armed conflict confirmed Hamas’ use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, stressing that “survivors deserve action, not doubt” and urging the Council to blacklist Hamas and formally designate it as a terrorist organization.
     On the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification’s “fabricated report”, he said it “lowered its own threshold to manufacture the so-called famine”, employing flawed methods while disregarding broader data that did not support its findings.  He further pointed out that across its 50 pages, “the word Hamas is not mentioned once”.
     Amid what he called “empty UN statements” and “meaningless summits”, he said “you leave the real work for us”, reiterating Israel’s commitment to “dismantle Hamas’ war machine”.

8) Briefing Security Council, Senior Official Stresses Importance of Cooperation, Warns against Politicization of Nord Stream Investigations — UN Press (2025-08-26)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16156.doc.htm
   Text:
     Nearly three years since the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, a senior United Nations official underscored that any intentional damage to critical civilian infrastructure should be condemned and investigated.
     The destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 has heightened concerns about the safety and security of critical civilian infrastructure “at a time of heightened tensions in the region”, said Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations.  He noted that the incident has also fuelled speculation over the past years, reiterating that the United Nations has no additional details of events and is not in a position to verify or confirm any claims or reports regarding the matter.
     Recalling that four leaks were reported in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines between 26 and 29 September 2022, he said the pipelines — located in international waters within the Swedish and Danish exclusive economic zones in the Baltic Sea — were not operational at the time but contained several hundred million cubic metres of natural gas.
     According to a 2025 study coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), this incident resulted in the planet’s largest human-caused release of methane.  It concluded that the plausible range of the Nord Stream leak was anywhere from 445,000 to 485,000 tons — “more than twice as much as previously thought”. According to the experts, “the Nord Stream leak contributed as much to global warming as would have 8 million cars driven for a year”, he said, citing the incident as “an important reminder of the environmental impact on global warming caused by the destruction of critical infrastructure”.
     He noted that Danish, German and Swedish authorities have provided regular updates on their separate national investigations.  As part of this investigation, the Federal Public Prosecutor General of Germany announced that a Ukrainian national was arrested in Italy on 21 August, based on a European arrest warrant requested by Germany.  The Russian Federation, however, has continued to voice concerns about the ongoing German investigation, calling for an international inquiry into the Nord Stream incidents.
     In the current volatile security environment, he stressed the importance of avoiding the politicization of any findings or developments, instead urging all parties to prioritize cooperation and dialogue.
     The representative of the Russian Federation called for a meticulous investigation into this “terrorist act”, which resulted in “unprecedented, deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure”, with direct risks to both the environment and navigation in the Baltic Sea.  He stressed that the inquiry must identify the perpetrators to ensure such crimes are never repeated.
     Despite numerous appeals, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, conducting their respective national investigations, had chosen to exclude the international community, releasing only “snippets of information” to the media that were insufficient to form a full picture of the events.  This, he said, was done under the pretext of maintaining investigative confidentiality, while all three States refused to cooperate with the Russian Federation.
     As anticipated, the Danish and Swedish investigations concluded after nearly 18 months with only one finding — that “the Nord Stream pipelines had indeed been blown up” — without identifying those responsible.  German investigators, he continued, were instructed to deliberately prolong the process, citing the detention of a Ukrainian national accused of belonging to the group allegedly behind the explosions.
     According to this account, the operation was carried out by an autonomous group of Ukrainian amateur divers acting “almost independently” or possibly on the orders of Ukraine’s former military leadership.  “We are asked to believe,” he said, “that in the middle of the Baltic Sea — despite a significant military presence, including NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] vessels — a group of semi-professional divers managed to plant explosives on the pipelines unnoticed.”  This sounds more like “the plot of a spy thriller” than a credible explanation, he added.
     “We see no reason to question the impartiality, thoroughness or scope of the ongoing German investigation,” countered Denmark’s delegate.  The explosions on pipelines connecting the Russian Federation and Germany occurred in international waters; however, because one of the explosions took place within the Danish Exclusive Economic Zone, Copenhagen’s independent authorities conducted their own investigation in close cooperation with international partners. Their findings confirmed that the pipelines had been deliberately sabotaged, but concluded there were insufficient grounds to pursue a criminal case in Denmark.  “No one is obstructing the Russian investigation,” he emphasized.
     He further noted that, while Moscow has repeatedly demanded the Council’s attention on the Nord Stream incidents, it has simultaneously been carrying out systematic military attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure — rendering its professed concern for infrastructure “rather hollow”.
     France’s representative was among many speakers criticizing the Russian Federation for its repetitive convening of unnecessary meetings such as today’s, noting that they only illustrate Moscow’s willingness to divert the Council’s attention and resources.  Investigations by Swedish and Danish authorities into the 2022 explosions cannot be said to lack transparency, and they have kept the Council informed of the findings of their in-depth, complex inquiries through various letters.  Noting that those national investigations were closed last February, while that of Germany’s continues, she said that, “by making the Council meet many times, the Russian Federation is putting pressure on Germany’s investigation, which is unacceptable”.
     Similarly, the United Kingdom’s delegate called on the Council to respect the integrity of national investigations, pointing out that “attempts to politicize the process or draw premature conclusions risk undermining the credibility of the legal proceedings and the cooperation between the countries involved”.
     Greece’s delegate concurred, pointing out that the Council is not the right forum for discussions of the internal legal and judicial processes of a sovereign State, adding:  “These are ongoing, confidential criminal investigations and the independence of the judiciary in Germany, as in any other country, cannot and should not be undermined or subjected to political pressure.”
     In a contrasting address, China’s representative, recalling his delegation’s requests for an objective, impartial investigation to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, observed that only limited information from Sweden, Denmark and Germany’s investigations being made public, leaving the public to rely on media exposés to speculate over what happened, stressing:  “This is anything but normal.”  Calling on Germany to expedite its investigations, he stressed:  “Truth should not be swept under the rug, investigations should not be politicized, and similar incidents should not be allowed to recur and perpetrators not allowed to walk free.”
     Algeria’s delegate, taking note of the latest findings provided by Sweden, Denmark and Germany, voiced grave concern over the deliberate attack on the pipelines.  Noting that his country is linked to Europe through three gas pipelines, he said that such attacks on critical infrastructure are “unacceptable under any circumstances”.  He called for the facts around the events to be fully determined, underscoring the need for accountability, a point echoed by the delegates of Somalia and Sierra Leone, with the latter emphasizing:  “The rule of law must prevail at every stage, from investigation to prosecution, so that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done in the circumstances.”
     For her part, Guyana’s representative, also underscoring the need for accountability for the intentional destruction of critical infrastructure, took note of the announcement of an arrest of a Ukrainian national in connection with the attacks by the Office of the Federal Prosecutor of Germany, said:  “We are hopeful that this development will accelerate the path towards accountability.”
     Similarly, Pakistan’s representative called for the strengthening of international cooperative frameworks to deter and prevent attacks on transnational infrastructure, voicing hope that the investigations, once concluded, will “reinforce the norm that all such attacks will be met with proper scrutiny and accountability in a transparent and objective manner”.
     For her part, Slovenia’s delegate reaffirmed her condemnation of the sabotage directed towards critical undersea infrastructure, voicing concern about the severe environmental impact of the incident, believed to have caused the single largest discharge of methane ever recorded.  Underscoring the need to protect critical submarine infrastructure against deliberate and accidental damage, she cited numerous such incidents in the Baltic Sea in recent years.  In that context, she voiced her country’s support for Germany’s ongoing investigations.
     Similarly, the Republic of Korea’s delegate joined other speakers in underscoring the need for transparency, due process, non-politicization and cooperative engagement with investigative authorities.  “Three and a half years of war in Ukraine have clearly shown how essential the protection of critical infrastructure is to international peace and stability,” he stated.
     The representative of Panama, Council President for the month, spoke in his national capacity to condemn any attack or act of sabotage against critical infrastructure — particularly when such actions threaten civilian populations or the environment.  He emphasized the vital role of the “invisible arteries” that link millions of people across continents, enabling the uninterrupted flow of energy services.  He further noted that safeguarding transnational infrastructure extends beyond energy facilities to include communication networks.  Citing Panama as an example, he highlighted that eight submarine cables converge through its territory, emphasizing that “protecting this infrastructure must be a collective priority.”
     The representative of the United States recognized the seriousness of the incident, rejecting politicization and using the Nord Stream sabotage as a basis for levelling hyperbolic accusations and escalatory rhetoric. “Let’s not focus the Council’s time and attention on an incident that took place nearly three years ago, but rather on ending the war in Ukraine,” he stressed, expressing full confidence in Germany’s independent judicial process.  He added: “President Trump has focused on one goal:  Bringing about a negotiated and durable peace in Ukraine to end the human suffering. We call on Russia to focus on that goal, as well.”

10) Ocean Biodiversity Treaty’s Preparatory Commission Revisits Agreement’s Clearing-House Mechanism, Relationship with Global Environment Facility — UN Press (2025-08-25)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sea2241.doc.htm
   Text:
     The commission charged with preparing for the entry into force of a new treaty on marine biodiversity resumed today its consideration of the mechanism by which information about treaty-related activities will be shared amongst States, with delegates debating the tasks, composition and working methods for the informal group of experts that will be responsible for its operationalization.
     That treaty was adopted on 19 June 2023, is open for signature until 20 September 2025, and will enter into force whenever it receives 60 instruments of ratification, approval, acceptance or accession thereto — currently eight more are needed.
     From 18 to 29 August, UN Headquarters is hosting the second of three gatherings of the “Preparatory Commission for the Entry into Force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and the Convening of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement”.  (Coverage to date is available here .)
     Under the Agreement, a Clearing-House Mechanism is to be established to serve as a centralized, open-access platform to enable parties to access, provide and disseminate information with respect to treaty activities.  Aiding today’s discussion were revised draft terms of reference prepared by the Commission’s Co-Chairs on the creation of an informal group of experts dedicated to operationalizing that Mechanism (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.2 ).  The document accounts for discussions and written input on this topic to date.
     As the Commission considered the tasks with which the informal group of experts will be charged, the Russian Federation’s representative asked delegates to reflect on the appropriate name for this group.  She emphasized that “this is, first and foremost, not a working group — but an expert group”.
     Along those lines, Vanuatu’s delegate, who spoke for Pacific small island developing States, expressed concern over the use of the term “scientific” in relation to the group’s proposed activities — as the term “technical” is broad and would cover many areas.  The speaker for Norway, whose delegation proposed that language, explained that the intent was distinguish “between the political and the scientific and the technical”.  As the term “technical” would also cover “scientific”, he said that his delegation “could go forward” with removing references to the latter term.  “The most important thing is that the group deliver technical advice to the Preparatory Commission and not political advice,” he underscored.
     With respect to the group’s activities, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, expressed flexibility, but noted a slight preference for language that would task the informal expert group with preparing a comparative assessment of existing multilateral clearing-house mechanisms with similar functions to that called for in the Agreement.  She said that the bloc holds this position “because it seems to be more feasible in the time constraints for the expert group that we have”.
     Japan’s delegate, however, expressed concern over adding such a comparative assessment “on top of the other tasks already prescribed”.  Instead, she voiced support for language calling on the group to “take stock” of existing mechanisms to use as a baseline, with the representatives of Canada and the Philippines in agreement.  New Zealand’s delegate noted that, while a comparative report would be an additional task, it is wise to learn lessons from other clearing-house mechanisms.  “Taking stock of existing mechanisms and platforms provides a practical and efficient basis for developing a roadmap for operationalization of the Clearing-House Mechanism,” said Türkiye’s representative.
     Meanwhile, Australia’s representative expressed concern over both options, stating that his delegation was “very reluctant to micromanage the expert group on its work when it reviews the existing clearing-house mechanisms” and therefore did not prefer language requiring a comparative assessment.  However, he also noted that language tasking the group with taking stock of existing mechanisms — and then using this as a baseline for developing a road map to operationalize the Agreement’s Clearing-House Mechanism — is potentially problematic because existing mechanisms “are potentially different” from the one envisioned by the Agreement.
     Maldives’ delegate added:  “It is important that the informal working group has a clear direction on where the Preparatory Commission needs guidance.”  Samoa’s representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said that, while undertaking a comparative assessment would help to inform the group’s guidance and recommendations to the Commission, “a stocktake — on its own — might not sufficiently inform this work”.
     The representative of Kenya, speaking for the African Group, stressed the need to “remain mindful of the limited time available” for the informal expert group to complete its mandate and deliver its report 120 days before the Preparatory Commission’s third session.  She therefore stressed the need for efficient, inclusive working methods.  Regarding the reference to the “guidance and advice” the group is to provide the Preparatory Commission, she stressed that it must be made clear that any outputs “remain in the nature of recommendations”.
     With respect to the technical aspects of the group’s work, Thailand’s delegate voiced concern that the draft terms of reference “at the moment is too descriptive”, stating:  “If we are going to task an informal group or set up a group to work on behalf of us, we should trust them.”  He added:  “They should be able to interpret the text of the Agreement and Mechanism designed by the Agreement.”
     Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s representative noted that, while “the substance of what the Clearing-House Mechanism needs to cover are set out in the Agreement”, the technical details in the draft terms of reference describe “how is this going to work on the ground for the users”.  Her delegation is “comfortable this is not expanding what’s in the Agreement or changing it”, she added.
     Delegations also elaborated on other aspects of the informal expert group, including its deliverables, with Canada’s representative expressing preference for the term “initial” versus “pilot” to describe the phase of the Mechanism’s operationalization on which the group would focus.  The latter, he pointed out, usually connotes “a testing period”.  Mexico’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group — which proposed the term “pilot” — said that “initial” is acceptable.  He stressed, however, that “the operationalization of the Mechanism is an ongoing process; it’s not going to be interrupted at some point”.
     Indonesia’s representative expressed support for the deletion of language concerning the group’s tasks relating to marine genetic resources and environmental-impact assessments.  However, Cuba’s delegate pointed out that language referring to marine genetic resources, benefit-sharing and environmental-impact assessments are not reflected elsewhere, and must be retained.
     An observer for the High Seas Alliance noted that the timeline and sequencing envisioned in the draft terms of reference is still keyed to the third session of the Preparatory Commission, which is scheduled to meet two to three months after the likely entry into force of the Agreement in January. To address this, he proposed that the current Preparatory Commission — in addition to discussing the draft terms of reference — develop separate instructions for interim arrangements to cover that initial gap.
     In the afternoon, the Commission continued its exchange of views on the revised draft terms of reference, then turning to a refreshed draft memorandum of understanding between the Conference of the Parties to the Agreement and the Council of the Global Environment Facility (document A/AC.296/2025/CRP.1 ).
     Some disagreement emerged concerning preambular paragraph 9 of that document, which refers to provisions in the Agreement setting out the general principles and approaches by which Parties to the Agreement shall be guided.  Further, the paragraph in question goes on to refer to the special circumstances of small island developing States and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.
     The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, while voicing support for the reference to the Agreement, said:  “We do not see the need for insisting in the memorandum of understanding on certain principles more than on others.”  Brazil’s delegate, speaking for the Core Latin American Group, reserved the right to return with additional comments on the added value of outlining those particular principles.
     However, the representative of Papua New Guinea, speaking for Pacific small island developing States, voiced strong support for the inclusion of references to the special circumstances of small island developing States, as well as to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  He pointed out that the special circumstances of those States are mentioned 20 times in the Agreement — with the article concerning funding mentioning this five times.  “Which reminds me of that joke:  ‘New York, New York — a town so nice they named it twice’,” he said.
     The Agreement is replete with references to special circumstances, he continued, adding that such references are relevant in the memorandum of understanding, as well.  Further, he stressed:  “Indigenous People are rights-holders, they’re not stakeholders or civil society.”  Therefore, their rights need to be recognized, and that principle needs to be included in the memorandum.  The representatives of Canada and Antigua and Barbuda, the latter of whom spoke for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), expressed support for that position.
     For her part, the Russian Federation’s delegate said that, unfortunately, the financing mechanism in the Agreement has become intertwined with the Global Environmental Facility, which works in a non-transparent way.  Before finalizing the memorandum, “we need to come to grips with how the funds are allocated for the needs of the Agreement”, she said.  “It is unclear why we have this text,” every provision of which requires additional clarification, she added.
     The Preparatory Commission will reconvene on Tuesday, 26 August, to discuss the selection process for members of the Scientific and Technical Body and other subsidiary bodies to be established under the Agreement, as well as the operationalization of other provisions on financing.

   Text:
     The General Assembly today adopted several resolutions, including one endorsing the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development held in Seville, Spain from 30 June to 3 July 2025.
     By a recorded vote of 158 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with one abstention (Argentina), the Assembly adopted that resolution (document A/79/L.109 ), backing the Sevilla Commitment , which sets out more than 130 concrete actions to mobilize development resources.
     Speaking before its adoption, many delegations voiced their support for the conference which brought together over 50 world leaders, but several other speakers pointed out areas of disagreement and contention.  Denmark’s delegate, speaking for the European Union in its capacity as observer, reaffirmed strong support for the outcome document but formally disassociated from two paragraphs.  On paragraph 50(F), the bloc warned that duplicating existing debt frameworks would “foster uncertainty, reduce predictability, and fragment the architecture”, undermining progress for low-income countries.  On paragraph 16, the climate finance language did not reflect the Paris Agreement on climate change’s principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.
     Palau’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the Sevilla Commitment is “a concrete affirmation to address the deeply entrenched inequities and shortfalls in the international financial architecture”.  It provides a renewed mandate to expedite implementation of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for small island developing States, advance the multidimensional vulnerability index as a tool for fairer access to concessional finance, operationalize the Debt Sustainability Support Service to build lasting solutions and recognize ocean finance as crucial to development. “Commitments must now be translated into action, and action into impact”, she stressed.
     Iraq’s delegate, speaking for the Group of 77 and China, welcomed the Commitment’s recognition of the $4 trillion financing gap and pledged to mobilize affordable, predictable financing, references to the right to development, stronger language on domestic resources, private sector finance, official development assistance (ODA), and climate finance.  At the same time, the Group regretted the absence of explicit commitments on “Leaving no one behind”, climate finance obligations under the Paris Agreement, and key priorities on trade, investment reform, and addressing unilateral measures.
     The Assembly went on to adopt a draft decision on “Participation of non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, academic institutions and the private sector in the ‘World Social Summit’ under the title ‘the Second World Summit for Social Development’ (document A/79/L.115 ).  Prior to its adoption, it also adopted the text’s draft amendment (document A/79/L.120 ), by a recorded vote of 64 in favour to 26 against, with 37 abstentions, that replaces its annex.  Introducing the amendment, the United Kingdom’s delegate stressed the important role of civil society in the multilateral process.
     By a text titled “Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia — residual functions” (document A/79/L.116/Rev.1 ), introduced by France’s delegate, the Assembly encouraged the Secretary-General and Cambodia to implement the Addendum to the Agreement on the Extraordinary Chambers, ensuring completion of residual functions and a smooth transition to a new Cambodian institution.  It further requested consultations to determine whether any residual functions remain and asked the Secretary-General to report back to the Assembly on the matter.
     “Global health is a universal right for rich and poor alike”, said the representative of Venezuela, speaking for the Group of Friends in Defense of the UN Charter on improving international cooperation and multilateral efforts to address global health challenges and promote equity in health for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the Assembly discussed earlier in the day.  “No country or region acting in isolation […] will be able to meet the urgent needs of their people,” he said.
     Further, he condemned “unilateral coercive measures” as “mass violations of human rights” and urged their immediate repeal, while denouncing United States efforts to discredit Cuban medical cooperation and praising Cuban doctors for saving lives worldwide.  On Gaza, the Group warned that “attacks have […] prompted the collapse of the health system” and called for urgent UN action to uphold the Palestinian people’s rights to health, food, and peace.
     The European Union’s representative said “global health and foreign policy are deeply interconnected” and “multilateralism to tackle health issues is delivering results”. “Urgent political action is needed to address the alarming stagnation of progress towards universal health coverage,” he said.  Likewise “strong multilateral cooperation and a robust multilateral health architecture, with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core, are essential”.
     Echoing that point, Thailand’s representative, speaking for the seven members of the Foreign Policy and Global Health (FPGH) Initiative, stressed:  “The spread of COVID-19 has reminded us that a threat to health anywhere is a threat to health everywhere”.  Pointing to the continued human cost and suffering from global health emergencies, he said:  “We must close the health gap faced by the poorest and the most vulnerable, eliminate structural inequalities, integrate environmental protection into public health priorities and catalyse regulatory and fiscal measures to support health objectives.”  Accordingly, he urged adequate, predictable and sustainable health financing.
     “Health is a fundamental human right and a central pillar of sustainable development,” underscored Iraq’s delegate, speaking for the Group of 77 and China.  Rising costs of health technologies and limited national capacities compound these gaps in access to medical equipment, vaccines, diagnostics, and health technologies that continue to disproportionately affect developing countries.  Yet the global response remains insufficient to meet the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda.  He urged increased investment in science, technology, and innovation, and for the implementation of initiatives in critical sectors such as health — where shortages are “particularly acute” and the migration of skilled professionals risks further weakening national systems.
     “In Cuba, health is a human right, enshrined in the Constitution”, said that country’s delegate, adding that “global health cannot be unlinked from political tensions, humanitarian emergencies or the unjust and unequal global economic order”. Citing multilateralism as “essential” to providing effective responses to global health emergencies and delivering true universal healthcare coverage, he said developed countries have an “inescapable debt” that they owe.  “Selfishness must be eliminated from international relations”, along with unilateral coercive measures, which negatively impact the enjoyment of the right to health, he affirmed.
     “Countries of the Global South should not choose between paying the suffocating external debts or financing their national healthcare systems,” he observed, calling for mutual support to build resilient, universal, and humane healthcare systems that are “not governed by the logic of the market”.  While $2.7 trillion is spent on military expenditures, 4.5 billion people worldwide lack access to basic healthcare services, and 2 billion are facing economic hardships due to the expenses of healthcare, he said, pointing to the collapse of the healthcare system in Palestine.
     Zambia’s delegate said “global health, foreign policy and sustainable development are inextricably linked” and that COVID-19 revealed “structural inequalities in access to vaccines, medicine and life-saving technology”.   “No country should be left behind,” he said, urging renewed global commitment and strengthened partnership to build a more equitable future for all.
     On the topic of the Secretary-General’s report on the UN Youth Office (document A/79/986 ), Kuwait’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, stressed that “investing in youth is not a luxury, but a necessity”.  He highlighted the Office’s impact despite limited resources, working with 60 UN agencies and 132 national teams.   The Group welcomed phase two of the UN Youth Strategy 2025–2030, placing young people “at the heart of achieving the SDGs” and ensuring accountability so that “the voice of youth will be turned into tangible actions”.  Also key is youth participation in peacebuilding, climate policies, and UN processes, as is protection from reprisals, expanded training and recruitment, and partnerships to build a fairer and more sustainable future.
     “Young persons are not only beneficiaries, but first and foremost essential partners in building sustainable, peaceful, and inclusive societies”, added the speaker for the European Union.  “It is important for youth participation to move beyond symbolism”, she asserted, adding that it must be institutionalized, inclusive and adequately resourced. Accordingly, she reiterated the bloc’s commitment to supporting the UN Youth Office in its efforts to strengthen accountability, broaden access and safeguard the participation of young persons, noting its ongoing contribution of €1 million to that end.
     Also welcoming the UN Youth Office’s 2025–2028 plan, the Philippines' delegate stressed that youth are “agents of change” central to peace and sustainable development.  She highlighted national initiatives like the Philippine Youth Development Plan, and programmes on internships, entrepreneurship, and inclusive education and underscored commitment to child protection and youth participation in multilateral fora.
     Kazakhstan’s speaker said the record-breaking attendance at the 2025 Economic and Social Council Youth Forum and the convening of Youth Action Day at the Summit of the Future, which engaged over 2,400 young participants, are testaments to the Office's growing role as “a central convener for youth voices”.  He further welcomed the launch of Youth2030 Phase 2, which introduces a results framework and six strategic priorities to expedite implementation of the UN Youth Strategy, citing the development of a system-wide youth marker to track investments as “a critical step” towards ensuring that “our commitments translate into tangible results for young people on the ground”.
     Lastly turning to the matter of Security Council reform to be taken up Tuesday, 25 August, the representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking for the “L.69 Group”, commended the leadership of the Intergovernmental Negotiations co-chairs and the constructive discussions held over the past nine months.  At the same time, he voiced concern that the revised co-chairs’ elements paper does not fully reflect Member States’ positions, noting mischaracterizations of the negotiations’ process, mention of new cross-regional groupings, and the absence of explicit support for expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories — despite this being the majority view.  She called for urgent work on a consolidated model to pave the way for text-based negotiations in the eightieth session, stressing that only a transparent, inclusive, and results-oriented process can deliver meaningful reform of the Security Council.
     “The time has come for continued demonstration of renewed political will to reform the Security Council and show its relevance and legitimacy in today’s world,” stated Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking for the African Union. The Pact for the Future generated a new sense of optimism for genuine progress on Security Council reform, he observed, underlining the need to address historical injustice suffered by the continent and to treat Africa as “a special case and priority”.  In this context, he recalled the adoption of the African Union’s reform model — this significant milestone reflects the continent’s unity and commitment to advance the common African position.
     In other matters, the Assembly  extended the appointment of Rebeca Grynspan as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for a further two-year term of office, from 12 September 2025 to 11 September 2027.  Ms. Grynspan was initially confirmed into that role on 12 September 2021.
