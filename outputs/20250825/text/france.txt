     David Lammy will tell MPs on Monday that the UK still intends to recognise a Palestinian state in September, with Israel having shown no sign of meeting the government’s demands. The foreign secretary will say in a Commons statement that government officials intend to carry out a formal assessment in the coming days of whether Israel has complied with the tests set out by the prime minister, Keir Starmer. But with Benjamin Netanyahu’s government continuing to harden its position on Gaza and the West Bank, the foreign secretary will confirm that Britain still plans to recognise Palestine. A UK official said: “We will assess all the factors relevant to recognition, but as things stand we’re on a pathway to recognition later in September.” Starmer said earlier in August that the UK would recognise Palestine before the UN general assembly, which starts on 9 September, unless Israel met a series of preconditions. The prime minister made his statement after conversations with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The latter has said France intends to recognise Palestine at the UN meeting. Starmer also spoke to Donald Trump before announcing his decision. The US president indicated the US would not object to such a move, but British officials are worried that his administration might retaliate by recognising Israeli jurisdiction over illegal settlements in the West Bank. Starmer’s conditions for Israel include taking “substantive steps” to end the war in Gaza, agreeing a ceasefire and committing not to annex parts of the West Bank. Far from taking steps towards satisfying any of those demands, however, Netanyahu has shown signs of violating them further. Reuters reported that Israel was considering annexation in the West Bank if France, the UK and other countries push ahead with recognising Palestine. Israeli officials said the subject was on the agenda for Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting on Sunday, but would not say where or when annexation could happen. The Foreign Office has just over a week to complete its formal assessment of Israel’s position. Senior government officials say the timing of the British recognition is being driven less by that process and more by diplomatic concerns that the government should be seen to be acting in concert with France. Lammy said on Sunday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where UN-backed experts recently declared a famine, was a “man-made catastrophe” caused by Israel’s refusal to let in aid deliveries. The UN panel said more than half a million people were living in famine conditions, which were likely to spread further in coming weeks. Lammy said in a statement: “The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic, with famine in Gaza City and women and girls bearing the brunt of the suffering. “The UK is doing all we can to improve the situation but we remain crystal clear: for aid to have impact, Israel must ensure it is allowed in and delivered safely and securely to civilians in desperate need.” The government also announced an extra £3m on Sunday to provide midwives and emergency medical supplies for new mothers in Gaza, but it said the aid would only reach the people who needed it if Israel allowed much greater humanitarian access to the region. Lammy said: “This funding can only have maximum impact if the government of Israel allows it. “Israel must ensure protection of civilians including healthcare staff and health infrastructure, and enable the delivery of life-saving medicines, medical equipment and healthcare supplies into Gaza.”

2) Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed 30 around Gaza City, local officials say — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

     Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 30 people in and around Gaza City, local health authorities said, as a 20-boat humanitarian aid flotilla carrying activists including Greta Thunberg set sail from Barcelona for the stricken territory. Authorities said the toll from Israeli tank and gunfire included 13 people who died trying to get food near a distribution site in the Gaza Strip, two in a house in Gaza City and 15, including five children, in a strike on a residential building on Saturday. Residents of Sheikh Radwan, one of Gaza City’s largest neighbourhoods, told reporters the area had been under Israeli tank shelling and airstrikes throughout Saturday, overnight and on Sunday morning, forcing many families to flee. Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire on crowds in the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli military zone bisecting Gaza. “We were trying to get food but were met with the occupation’s bullets,” said Ragheb Abu Lebda, from Nuseirat. “It’s a death trap.” Rezik Salah, a father-of-two from Sheikh Radwan, told Reuters that Israeli troops were now “crawling into the heart of the city … from the east, north and south, while bombing those areas from the air and ground to scare people to leave”. The actors Susan Sarandon, Liam Cunningham and Eduard Fernández were among campaigners from more than 40 countries onboard the Sumud (“Resilience” or “Perseverance” in Arabic) flotilla when it sailed on Sunday afternoon. Organisers said what they called the biggest humanitarian flotilla to Gaza so far, also carrying several European political figures including the former Barcelona mayor Ada Colau, aimed to “break the illegal siege of Gaza” and “open a humanitarian corridor to end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people”. Dozens of other boats from Greece, Italy, Tunisia and other Mediterranean ports are due to join in the crossing next week. Israel has already blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to the coastal territory, intercepting vessels offshore in June and July. Thousands of supporters flocked to the pier in the Catalan capital, some wearing kaffiyehs and chanting “Free Palestine” and “Boycott Israel”. The boats setting sail ranged from run-down old yachts to commercial vessels. “The story here is how people are being deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive,” Thunberg said. Cunningham called the flotilla “an indication of the world’s failure to uphold international law and humanitarian law … and a shameful, shameful period in the history of our world”. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed on Sunday that Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, had been killed in a joint operation with the Shin Bet domestic intelligence service in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. However, the group did confirm the death of Mohammed Sinwar, its presumed leader in Gaza, more than three months after Israel said it had identified his body in a tunnel in central Gaza. The Barcelona flotilla’s departure came two days after the Israeli military ended temporary pauses in the area that had allowed for some aid deliveries. Gaza City was a “dangerous combat zone”, the military said in justification for its decision. In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet would meet on Sunday evening to discuss the next stages of the planned offensive to seize Gaza City, although a full-scale offensive is not expected to start for weeks. Israel has said it aims to evacuate the civilian population before moving more ground forces in. Mirjana Spoljaric of the Red Cross said such a move would provoke a massive population displacement that no other part of the Gaza Strip would be able to absorb. About half of Gaza’s more than 2 million residents are sheltering in Gaza City, local sources estimate, although thousands are believed to have left or to be trying to leave, to seek refuge in more central and southern areas of the territory. Large crowds in Tel Aviv demonstrated against the war on Saturday night and the families of hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza protested outside the homes of Israeli cabinet ministers on Sunday morning. The war began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people – mostly civilians – were killed and 251 taken hostage. Forty-seven hostages are still being held in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 63,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Gaza, considered reliable by the UN. It has left much of Gaza in ruins and plunged it into a humanitarian crisis. The UN this month declared a state of famine in the territory, saying 500,000 people faced “catastrophic” conditions. The Israeli army said on Sunday it had carried out a strike on a site run by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. “The existence of the site and the activity within it constitute a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,” it said.

3) Lyon mayor condemns ‘Free Gaza’ defacement of Holocaust memorial — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     A Holocaust memorial unveiled only eight months ago in the French city of Lyon has been inscribed with the words “Free Gaza”, local officials said, amid growing concern about antisemitic incidents in France. The words were scratched into the black marble memorial late on Saturday, the city’s mayor, Grégory Doucet, said. Yonathan Arfi, of the Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), posted a photo on social media and called the incident “despicable”. Doucet said the defacement of the 3-metre-tall memorial, outside the city station from where hundreds of Jews were transported to Nazi death camps, was “intolerable” and the perpetrators would be “pursued and prosecuted”. Lyon “continues to stand firm against hatred, antisemitism and racism”, the mayor said. The memorial was unveiled in January to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. The number of antisemitic incidents recorded in France has risen sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the start of Israel’s retaliatory offensive, which has killed at least 63,000 Palestinians, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry. The French interior ministry said last week that 27% fewer anti-Jewish acts were recorded in France in the first six months of 2025 than in the same period the previous year, but that the number was more than twice as high as in the first half of 2023. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused Emmanuel Macron of contributing to a surge in antisemitism by calling for international recognition of a Palestinian state, a claim the French president described as “abject” and “erroneous”. This week the French government, which has publicly denounced antisemitism and increased security at synagogues and other Jewish centres, summoned the US ambassador to Paris after he accused it of not doing enough to stem anti-Jewish hate crimes.

4) Vladimir Putin meets Xi Jinping arrives in China for security summit – Ukraine war live — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

     Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events: Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Chinese city of Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security summit, which is aimed at countering western influence in global affairs. China’s President Xi Jinping personally welcomed several leaders to the summit, including Putin, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Xi is expected to hold talks with Putin later on in the week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country’s forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia after he met with his top general, Oleksandr Syrsky. Zelenskyy said Moscow’s forces are suffering heavy losses around Pokrovsk, the strategically important logistics hub in eastern Ukraine that Russia wants to seize control of. Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia’s war in Ukraine by convincing Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, Axios reported. Ukraine’s armed forces said on Sunday that Russian forces failed to gain full control of any major Ukrainian city over the summer as it hit back at Moscow’s claims of a successful summer offensive. Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. A Ukrainian former parliamentary speaker was shot dead in Lviv on Saturday, authorities said, as European foreign ministers met to discuss increasing pressure on Moscow to end its war against Ukraine. Andriy Parubiy, a member of parliament who served as parliamentary speaker from 2016 to 2019 and a key figure in Ukraine’s 2013 pro-European Maidan revolution, was shot dead, prosecutors said. A murder investigation has been launched and the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned the killing as a “horrific murder”. Europe’s foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss possible measures to force Moscow to the negotiating table. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was “clearly not preparing for peace”. “The European Union and all the member states support the diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and the end of Russia’s war. But it’s clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Ministers also discussed the war in Gaza and the deepening humanitarian crisis there. You can read the full story here: Here are some more pictures from the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, where the two-day SCO security summit is being held: Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Tianjin, China. As a reminder (see post at 09.05), the Russian leader will take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin today and tomorrow. He is then due to travel to Beijing to hold talks with Xi and possibly North Korean leader Kim Jong-un later on in the week. The SCO is regional security grouping set up to limit the influence of western alliances such as Nato. Xi and Putin are close strategic allies. The Chinese leader last visited Putin in May for the Victory Day parade in Moscow, which saw Russian troops fighting in Ukraine marching with Chinese forces to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in the second world war. Following a meeting with Ukraine’s top general, Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country’s forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia. In a post on X, the Ukrainian leader wrote: We analysed in detail the situation in the Zaporizhzhia direction and the enemy’s intentions. Also the situation in the border areas of the Sumy and Kharkiv regions. We will continue our active operations in exactly the way needed for Ukraine’s defence. The forces and resources are prepared. New deep strikes have also been planned. Russia launched a deadly attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday when a five-storey residential building was hit in Zaporizhzhia. In his X post, Zelenskyy said that the Russian army is “concentrating its greatest efforts” in Pokrovsk, a strategically important logistics hub and mining town in eastern Ukraine that was once considered the safest place in the Donbas. Zelenskyy said Russia is suffering heavy losses in the area, and claimed that, overall, more than 290,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or severely injured in fighting across the frontline since the start of the year. “The majority of these losses were sustained precisely in the Donetsk region, while failing to achieve any of their strategic objectives,” he wrote. Zelenskyy recently warned that Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the mining town which Moscow has been trying to capture for more than two years. The Kremlin said that European powers were hindering US President Donald Trump’s efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine and that Russia would continue its operation in Ukraine until Moscow saw signs that Kyiv was ready for peace. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media reporters that the “European party of war” was continuing to hinder US and Russian efforts on Ukraine. “We are ready to resolve the problem by political and diplomatic means,” Peskov said. “But so far we do not see reciprocity from Kyiv in this. So we shall continue the special military operation.” European powers say that they do not believe Putin wants peace in Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace but that Russia will not give up any of the land that it has taken in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said that it had struck Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. The military recorded multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia’s south and said there was also a fire in the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara region. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one of the refinery’s units. Russia has downed 112 Ukrainian drones in the past 24 hours and hit port infrastructure in Ukraine used for military purposes, Interfax news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying on Sunday. We will give you more on this as we get it. At an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Friday, the US warned Russia to move toward some sort of peace settlement and meet with Ukraine or face possible sanctions. The meeting was called after a major Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday that killed more than 20 people. John Kelley, the US mission’s minister-counselor, said the airstrikes “cast doubt on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace” and demanded they stop. He said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy must agree to meet, and reiterated Donald Trump’s warning that the US could impose sanctions on Russia if the war continues. Despite months of diplomatic efforts, Putin has repeatedly ignored Trump’s calls to end the fighting. The “America First” Trump administration has not taken any tangible steps to pressure Russia into stopping its attacks, but has paused intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv at various points. Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia’s war in Ukraine by convincing Volodymyr Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, Axios is reporting. The officials, frustrated by the lack of progress since the Putin-Trump talks in Alaska two weeks ago, said some European leaders are pushing Ukraine to hold out for unrealistic territorial concessions by Russia. “The Europeans don’t get to prolong this war and backdoor unreasonable expectations, while also expecting America to bear the cost,” a senior White House official told Axios. “If Europe wants to escalate this war, that will be up to them. But they will be hopelessly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.” Axios did not specify what countries the US officials were referring to but the outlet was told that it was not the UK or France, who set up the “coalition of the willing”, a loose partnership of western countries pledging support for Ukraine. Donald Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness, the Kremlin has held back and intensified attacks on Ukraine despite international diplomatic efforts to bring the war to an end. The deadly assaults have renewed calls to use Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin. A Russian drone attack overnight damaged four power facilities near the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, leaving more than 29,000 customers without electricity this morning, the region’s governor and power firm DTEK said. Hardest hit was the port city of Chornomorsk, just outside Odesa, where residential houses and administrative buildings were also damaged, according to Oleh Kiper, the governor of the broader Odesa region. One person was reported to have been injured in the attack. In a Facebook post, the DTEK Group wrote: The enemy continues its energy terror in the Odessa region. Four DTEK energy facilities were attacked during the night attack. Russian drones also targeted Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region this morning, damaging energy infrastructure and leaving 30,000 households without electricity, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said. The Guardian’s Russian affairs reporter, Pjotr Sauer, has written a piece about Putin’s trip and what it may mean for the war in Ukraine. Here is an extract of his story: Key on the agenda, analysts say, will be for Putin and Xi to align their positions on the war in Ukraine amid US efforts to end the fighting. “It is an important time for them to talk about where the war is headed and how likely it is to be stopped in the near future,” said Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre. Gabuev said Moscow wanted to know whether it could expect any further assistance from China and how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting… China has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine, and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort. Bilateral trade climbed to more than $240bn last year, two-thirds higher than before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Beijing is now the leading buyer of Russian oil and coal and will shortly surpass Europe as Moscow’s main market for natural gas… The talks are also likely to touch on deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, a development that has alarmed western governments. While China has stopped short of providing direct military aid, US officials say Beijing has supplied about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the semiconductors Russia needs to rebuild its war machine. In return, China is believed to be receiving assistance in sensitive defence technologies. China claims it is a neutral mediator in the war in Ukraine, but the two countries have pulled closer together since the start of the invasion. Vladimir Putin and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi are among the more than 20 world leaders attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which is being held in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus – with 16 more countries affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”. The China and Russia-led regional security grouping is trying to rebalance global power in their favour and away from the US. Putin, who is wanted for war crimes by the international criminal court, arrived in Tianjin on Sunday to a red carpet welcome and warm greetings from top-ranking city officials. During his trip, which is expected to stretch to close to a week, the Russian president will hold talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping, his close ally, and watch Beijing’s Victory Day military parade marking 80 years since Japan’s defeat in the second world war, where Putin is due to be the star guest alongside North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and leaders of Iran and Cuba. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and North Korea confirmed this April that it had deployed soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops. Putin has turned to Beijing for trade and political support since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022. China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Ukraine’s armed forces said on Sunday that Russian forces failed to gain full control of any major Ukrainian city over the summer. The chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that since March Russia had captured more than 3,500 square km (1,351 square miles) of territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages. “Despite Gerasimov’s claims, Russian forces have not gained full control over any major city,” the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. “The figures presented by the occupiers regarding captured territories and settlements are grossly exaggerated.” We have not yet been able to independently verify any of these claims. Ukraine acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Russia’s army had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region, a central administrative area previously spared from intense fighting. Russian forces have slowly gained ground in costly battles for largely devastated areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, normally with few inhabitants or intact buildings left. Russia launched a sweeping attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday, with one person killed and 24 injured, including three children, when a five-storey residential building was hit in Zaporizhzhia, according to officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for “tougher” western sanctions on Russia as he says Vladimir Putin’s attacks shows he is not at all interested in trying to pursue peace.

5) David Hockney’s 90-metre Normandy nature frieze to be shown in London — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

     In the spring of 2020, as the Covid-19 virus was “going mad”, David Hockney kept himself busy by painting winter trees bursting into blossom in his Normandy garden. “Many people said my drawings were a great respite from what was going on,” Britain’s pre-eminent living artist said at the time. Citizens of the post-pandemic world, with its rollercoaster of conflict, rightwing populism, climate crisis and techno-revolution, may still be in need of Hockney’s respite by next spring. They will find it at an exhibition of his extraordinary 90-metre frieze, A Year in Normandy, and other works at the Serpentine gallery in London. The free exhibition is likely to draw thousands of fans of the 88-year-old artist, adored for his vibrant images, bluff Yorkshire manner and defiant advocacy of smoking. The show will be mounted in the same year as the Bayeux tapestry – cited by Hockney as an inspiration for his frieze, and described by the artist as “one of the oldest and most remarkable artworks” – comes to London for the first time in nearly 1,000 years in a cultural exchange with France. Hockney moved to Normandy, the home of the Bayeux tapestry, in late 2019, and began producing images of winter trees on his iPad. “Then this virus started …” he told the BBC in the spring of 2020. He sent images to his friends, and publicly released one of daffodils, titled: Do Remember They Can’t Cancel the Spring. “Why are my iPad drawings seen as a respite from the news? Well, they are obviously made by the hand depicting the renewal that is the spring in this part of the world.” He added: “We have lost touch with nature rather foolishly as we are a part of it, not outside it. This will in time be over and then what? What have we learned?” Hockney joined together all 220 pictures of the changing seasons into one continuous frieze. “The viewer will walk past it like the Bayeux tapestry, and I hope they will experience in one picture the year in Normandy,” he said. Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the son of a devout Methodist mother and a socialist activist, first world war conscientious objector father. He decided at the age of 11 he wanted to be an artist, and studied at the Bradford School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London. In the 1960s he produced some of the works that he is still famous for: swimming pools, palm trees, blue skies and beautiful people in Los Angeles. He has always embraced different media, and much of his recent work has been produced on an iPad. This year, the largest ever Hockney exhibition, of more than 400 images spanning 70 years, was hosted in Paris to rave reviews. It closes on Monday. Bettina Korek and Hans Ulrich Obrist of the Serpentine said they were thrilled that Hockney had agreed to the exhibition, which “promises to be a landmark cultural moment”. The exhibition will also include Hockney’s celebrated Moon Room, which reflects his interest in the cycle of light and time passing, and will feature digital paintings from his Sunrise body of work. The exhibition will close just weeks before the Bayeux tapestry, depicting the 1066 conquest of England by William the Conqueror, goes on show at the British Museum in London. Experts have said that the tapestry is too fragile to be moved, and more than 60,000 people have signed a petition urging Emmanuel Macron, the French president, to reverse his “catastrophic” decision to agree to the loan. David Hockney: A Year in Normandy will be at Serpentine North from 12 March until 23 August 2026

6) I’m a liberal who loves hunting. Allow me to change your mind — The Guardian (2025-08-31)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/31/hunting-personal-essay
   Text:
     “Murderer! You’re a murderer!” That is what my French mother shouts down the phone line – right after I tell her I had grouse for dinner. “Grouse?” she gasps. “Yes,” I say, using my nonchalant voice. “We went hunting and shot two of them. Plump ones. I braised them in a mushroom broth and served them with stewed apples and potato mash.” She shrieks. “I can’t believe you killed an animal!” “Mom! Didn’t you just make lamb tagine?” Pause. “Yes, I cooked a Moroccan tagine with raisins, green olives and a lot of cinnamon,” she replies defensively. “I made it with lamb I bought at the farmers’ market. What’s your point?” “My point is,” I say, “where do you think that lamb came from? Did it magically appear on your plate?” It was not a conversation I was going to win, not even with a French woman living in the land of duck foie gras, cured pork sausage and snails – all of which was killed far less humanely than the grouse on my plate. That is what I was trying to tell Mom: hunting may be morally complex, but it is a far more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than the factory-farmed products most people eat. I am not arguing for everyone to go out and hunt their dinner – that would be absurd. But the reflexive disdain for hunters on much of the left feels misplaced. Let me explain. *** If I truly am a murderer, I am not a very vicious one. I killed my first mule deer on public land in northern Montana at the tail end of a five-hour hunt in frigid temperatures on Thanksgiving. My partner and I had been tracking signs all day – hiking up and down ridges, glassing hillsides with binoculars – until I could not feel my toes. We were ready to give up when the curious eyes of two does landed on us. With their oversized ears and mile-long eyelashes, they looked dainty and otherworldly, as if they had stepped out of a Grimm fairy tale. The one in front, maybe 80 yards (73 metres) away, studied me. She had one leg slightly raised, the others rooted in snow, frozen in that split-second decision: flee or stay? Mule deer are naturally more curious and less skittish than their white-tailed cousins, which gave me a crucial edge. I had one extra heartbeat to steady my breath, nestle the rifle into my shoulder, and count to three while exhaling. I pulled the trigger. The shot echoed across the ridge. The doe’s knees buckled and she collapsed. My chest seized – I wanted to give the doe a quick death. I reloaded and fired again, trying to stay steady as adrenaline coursed through my body. I walked to her, stroked her soft ears and burst into tears. Looking back, I am not embarrassed by my reaction; it seemed fitting to the gravity of the experience. In that instant – and there is really no other way to describe it – I felt an immense surge of love for that animal. It reminds me of what the British philosopher Julian Baggini has wondered about modern food gathering: is disgust at meat eating really a sign of a more civilized society, or simply a mark of one that has become detached from the realities of life and death? *** My ascent to the world of hunting was not linear. I moved to the United States 10 years ago, carrying with me the wide-eyed fascination so many French people have for America. I had a slightly embarrassing love for its excess, its swagger, the bigness of it all. But more than that, it was the land – from the Redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, as the song goes – that felt like freedom for me. During my first year in New York City, I befriended Caty and Ryan, two journalists recently transplanted from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Everything about their lives struck me as exotic. Their hallway was cluttered with skis, climbing gear and camping equipment that suggested a life lived outdoors. Mountaineering magazines were strewn on the dining table, and a print of Ansel Adams’s celebrated photograph of the high desert hung on their kitchen wall, austere and magnetic. Soon, Ryan taught me how to fly fish in the rivers of upstate New York – a hobby so quintessentially American I thought it came with its own Yankee passport. Standing in the Beaverkill river, casting in cold thigh-high waters, I was enthralled. When I caught my first rainbow trout, I held its iridescent body underwater and gasped at its beauty. I removed the hook from its mouth and let it go. That winter, Ryan prepared a meal that shifted everything I thought I knew about hunting. Over candlelight, he brought out quails he had shot that fall in his native North Dakota. They had been braised for five hours in apple cider and sage. Silence fell on the table as we ate. Each bite came with the appreciation of what it took for it to reach our plates: a punishing cross-country road trip followed by freezing mornings traipsing through fields with Magnolia, his trusty hunting Labrador, by his side. This food carried a story that was a far cry from the plastic-wrapped slabs of meat stacked in supermarket coolers, and far more interesting. *** *** Hunting has always had a terrible reputation in France, especially in affluent cities. In the court of public opinion – especially on the political left, where my heart is firmly anchored – hunters are viewed with suspicion, if not outright contempt. It is not without reason. Hunting has long been associated with a retrograde political party formerly called Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition, a right-leaning group that seemed to be populated by portly men who sported mustaches and red cheeks, and had an inclination to drink wine before noon. Now, hunting still only makes headlines when accidents happen. So perhaps it is no surprise the sport is in decline: perception matters. In France, about 58% of hunting permit holders are aged 55 or older, and only 3% are women. In the UK, where I lived for eight years, hunting is mostly seen as an upper-class pursuit, and the lingering stain of fox hunting makes it hard to separate the sport in the public eye from cruelty. But in the US, hunting is more widely practiced across groups – even across party lines. Kamala Harris’s former running mate, Tim Walz, for example, is a dedicated wild turkey hunter in Minnesota. In Missoula, where I live – a blue dot in a red state – my hunting community includes conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts, university lecturers and, more prosaically, people simply looking to fill the freezer. There are plenty of Maga types too, I am sure – they are just not in my social circles. Native tribes across the state, who overwhelmingly skew Democrat, hold hunting rights for both big and small game on their lands; their ancestral foodways are considered sacred. More women than ever before are joining the ranks. I am one of them. So is my friend DeAnna Bublitz, who wanted to be more intentional with her meat consumption. “I figured that if I couldn’t pull the trigger myself, I should probably stop eating meat,” she says. But entering the hunting world dominated by older men felt intimidating. “I was lucky to have a female friend who is a top-notch hunter and willing to loan me gear and mentor me. That made all the difference,” she says. “There are a lot of barriers for folks who didn’t grow up hunting – cost and mentorship are two of the biggest in my mind.” The experience transformed her. Her mentor not only taught her practical skills but also helped her process the complicated emotions that come with killing an animal. Eventually, DeAnna started Deer Camp, a free gear library for hunters, and now mentors new hunters herself – including me. “The folks I see expressing interest want to eat healthier, more ethical meat and they’re a more diverse crowd – often younger, with a lot of women and people from the LGBTQIA+ community. But those same groups may not feel safe going into the woods alone or with a stranger. How we depict hunting in media, and who we choose to represent it, can go a long way in either making people feel welcome or shutting them out. The experiences you can have out there are incredible, though – fostering new friendships alongside a sense of stewardship for the land.” In other words, if you are concerned with the health of our ecosystems, maybe – just maybe – I could change your mind. *** Perhaps this is where I should address the elephant in the room: firearms. In the US, thanks to the 1937 Pittman-Robertson Act, taxes on firearms and ammunition are funneled directly into wildlife conservation and habitat restoration. Over the decades, it has generated more than $15bn. Hunters are required to take a gun safety course, which means we start out more educated about risks than the broader gun-owning population. While I would love to call myself an archer, which arguably demands more skills, most of us use rifles: they are accurate and they tend to make for a quicker death. Still, I feel deep ambivalence about firearms. Gun culture unsettles me, and the proliferation of semi-automatic weapons in particular terrifies me. I cannot imagine a world where assault-style rifles belong in civilian hands – let alone with 18-year-olds. I often think of Australia, a country with plenty of big-game hunters, where a single mass shooting in 1996 prompted sweeping reform led by a conservative government. That policy shift ended mass shootings (and firearm suicides dropped, too). It is the kind of success story I wish we could claim here. What makes it harder to stomach is how far the NRA has drifted. Once an organization rooted in hunting and safety, it has become a cynical lobby that trades in fear and division. Take Ryan Busse, a longtime gun executive and keen hunter. He quit his role after watching the gun lobby embrace far-right politics to make a buck – then ran for governor of Montana last year (he lost). Writing in the Guardian, he argued that “it’s up to responsible gun owners and others who care about our country to speak out against [the gun lobby’s] egregiously irresponsible behavior and in favor of commonsense laws like universal background checks and extreme risk protection orders”. Stories like his underline what often gets lost: for many hunters, firearms are a means to an end, not an identity. *** *** I often think of this: hunters and vegetarians – both judged by others, both right – are more alike than either would admit. It is a complex comparison, but consider this: both think deeply about what they eat. They spend a lot of time pondering food ethics: good quality sustenance, preferably sourced locally. Both care about ecosystems and how to preserve them for future generations. Both worry about animal welfare. And yet in western society, veganism holds the moral high ground. Never mind that many plant-based products come shrink-wrapped in plastic and shipped across oceans. The ingredients in vegan snacks – soy, palm oil, cacao, quinoa, coconut, bananas – are rarely local; they rely on extractive systems, exploitative labor and long-distance freight. Large-scale monocropping for soy, corn and wheat depletes soil and accelerates biodiversity loss. This is not a purity test. All I am saying is that eating ethically today is nearly impossible – vegan or not. But most wild game meat? It is sustainable, when conservation practices are observed. And I would argue that it is the most ethical meat one can consume. “Hunters are removing animals, that’s true,” Rebecca Mowry, a wildlife biologist with Montana fish, wildlife and parks, told me. “But they also tend to be extremely passionate about those animals, and deeply invested in making sure they’re still here for future generations.” Each year, state biologists like her set hunting quotas to address overpopulation. Hunters then pay for licenses – or enter lotteries for tags – and those fees directly support wildlife management programs. This system exists for a reason: unchecked animal populations can cause real damage. Deer and hogs, for example, can overgraze and destroy entire ecosystems. In France, the National Forestry Office warns that more than 50% of state-owned forests are ecologically out of balance due to exploding populations of deer, roe deer and wild boar. In Texas, feral hogs are so invasive they are costing millions in the agriculture industry – this very newspaper called it “an aporkalypse”. Mowry says hunting “is a very valuable tool to help manage ecosystems, for multiple reasons”. Without enough predators or healthy migration corridors, she explained, big game populations can balloon beyond what the land can support. “We’re not living in untouched wilderness anymore,” she says. “With all the development on winter range, we’ve altered the balance – and hunting helps restore it.” In his book How the World Eats, Baggini, the British philosopher, describes the Hadza, Tanzania’s last hunter-gatherer society. “They move with the seasons,” he writes, “taking from the natural environment only what they need to survive, leaving it able to replenish itself – so that any extraction of resources can go on indefinitely.” That, Baggini observes, is the very definition of sustainability. Thosh Collins, an Indigenous health educator, author and experienced hunter, echoed this when he told me: “When we harvest, process and cook our food, we’re literally taking the land into our bodies.” His family also seasonally forages on their land in the Arizona desert and grows traditional foods such as corn, bean and squash. For Collins, meat carries spirit – not just calories. “From the Indigenous perspective, a hunter possesses the ability to transform death into nourishment,” he says. “One of the most fascinating paradoxes of our lives is that life feeds off of death. Life energy crosses from one form to another. No one person is exempt from this. If you’re living, you’re taking up space from other sentient life forms trying to thrive.” His O’odham ancestors never separated sustenance from reverence, and neither does he. After a kill, he performs a giving-of-thanks ritual to help send the animal’s spirit on. Nothing about the act is casual; everything is deliberate. Part of what makes a hunter successful is the ability to know the habitat they are in: you have to learn to read the land, understand how changing seasons affect species, and how fires, droughts and climate shifts shape entire ecosystems. Which is why I do not know any group – aside from Native tribes and biologists – more attuned to the health of elk herds, the decline of pronghorns, or the migration patterns of Canada geese than hunters. Yes, hunters kill animals. But Mowry, the Montana biologist, also points out hunters “are largely responsible for some of the most successful wildlife restorations in the country”. How? They fight for public land access – and helped win a political battle earlier this year. They campaign for clean water, wildlife corridors and the removal of barbed-wire fences that kill mule deer and antelope. They report poachers. They fill out wildlife surveys that provide essential data to state officials. Some groups lobby against encroaching development; others build education programs. Many donate meat to food banks. They mentor newcomers, volunteer their time and skills, and open their tables to others. In other words, hunters do not just understand interconnectedness – they live it. Can we all say the same? *** *** After seven years in New York, I moved out west to Montana with my partner Ben, an enthusiastic outdoorsman. The move to the Rockies was a culture shock: I left skyscrapers for snow-capped mountains, $23 cocktails in Manhattan for sticky floors in boisterous dive bars. It was also the perfect terrain to learn how to hunt my own meat. The learning curve was steep. For months, Ben patiently fielded my endless questions: how do you follow a game trail? When do bucks rut – and why do their lymph nodes swell? What’s an elk herd’s migration pattern? Should I worry about chronic wasting disease? I had to learn how to move in the woods: slowly, methodically, discerning broken branches, bedding areas or fresh droppings. I practiced reading wind direction using a neat little indicator powder, studied how to scan hillsides using binoculars, and mastered the art of opening snacks without making any noise. Still, I was afraid I would not be able to carry the responsibility of taking an animal’s life. I had to remind myself that by my standards eating a burger at McDonald’s or chicken strips at my local bar was a worse choice. I studied and passed the hunter safety course. I joined Venery, a women’s hunting group, and spent time with them at the shooting range, familiarizing myself with a tool that until then had been foreign and terrifying to me: a .308 Winchester rifle. Learning with other women gave me the confidence I needed to later go in the field, where I had both amazing and dispiriting experiences. Hunting, after all, is never a promise — it’s unpredictable, and often hard. To kill is to bear witness to the cycle of life. No longer can you outsource the unpleasantness – not to Whole Foods, not to Lidl, not even to your local farmer. Digging your fingers through the entrails, you take ultimate responsibility for your own sustenance. I hesitate to say this, but it is an elating feeling: with it comes a sense of self-reliance long forgotten, especially when everything you would ever want can be delivered to you overnight by underpaid delivery workers. Hunting is the opposite of that: it is patient, demanding, gnarly. It comes with smells, textures and colors rarely seen by anyone eating commercial meat. It is also new language: as you spend days climbing hills and crossing marshes for a chance to complete the task, you live in the present. Collins, the O’odham hunter, told me that his sister is a former vegan. Now, she “will only eat the meat my dad and I hunt because she knows we did it with a good heart and mind and that a ceremony was performed for the buck to send his spirit to rejoin his relatives”. For Collins, hunting is part of a broader circle of sustenance passed down from his ancestors. It’s not just about the meat, but about gratitude, ceremony and a sense of duty. “Foodways is about doing things on the land with people you love, for people you love,” he said. *** These days, I eat far less store-bought meat – though I will admit a weakness for poultry, a whole ethical mess of its own. Instead, we often have elk backstraps, ground venison and summer sausage – all processed at home, wrapped in butcher paper adorned with handwritten details and the processing date on it, stacked deep in my freezer chest. Last fall, I killed a young whitetail buck. Ben and I butchered it in two hours, under the sun filtering through the ponderosa pines. We took with us tenderloins, backstraps, shanks, legs, with leftovers going to scavengers – nothing going to waste. Back home, I marinated the deer’s heart – a perfectly tender piece of meat – in a mixture of soy, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, thyme and vinegar. I grilled it alongside a pile of red peppers, zucchinis and onions, and served it with buttered sourdough bread. My golden retriever, Billie, happy to act as my sous chef, ate the scraps. Forest to plate, in under 48 hours.

7) Family of French woman killed by ex-partner to go to court to find out why she was not protected — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     The family of a woman killed by an ex-partner who bombarded her with hundreds of messages and calls will ask a judge on Monday to force the French authorities to explain why they failed to protect her. Sandra Pla had complained to police three times about Mickaël Falou’s threatening behaviour over a period of six months, but her application for a protection order was rejected. After she sent a desperate plea for help to the public prosecutor in which she wrote “I fear the worst,” Falou was finally summoned by police and told he was being put under investigation. Less than 36 hours after he was released and ordered not to approach Pla, Falou hid for more than four hours in a shed outside her apartment and attacked her as she returned from dropping their daughter at school, stabbing her 50 times. At his trial in January, Falou was convicted of murder and jailed for 30 years. Now Pla’s family want to know why police, social services and the family courts ignored the warning signs. Their lawyer, Elsa Crozatier, submitted a formal case accusing the state authorities of “serious failings” 18 months ago, but says there has been no answer. Crozatier will go to court in Paris on Monday to ask a judge to force them to respond. “I am scandalised by the hypocritical attitude of the state. It claims its priority is combating violence against women but the authorities failed to protect Sandra when she asked for help several times,” Crozatier told the Guardian. “It’s been four years and we’ve had no explanations of what happened and why. We’ve been told it wouldn’t happen today, but we’ve no idea what has changed.” Between 3 January 2021 when Pla, 31, ended their relationship and 18 June 2021, Falou, 40, bombarded her with 317 text messages and telephoned her 67 times. His almost daily presence outside her home was recorded by the doorbell camera her parents installed, but police said Falou was on the public highway and could not be prosecuted. Finally, Pla’s mother, Annie, and stepfather, Gérard, moved from Spain into her small apartment in Bordeaux to protect their daughter, who was so scared her doctor signed her off work for 15 days. In April 2021, police referred the case to social services, who recommended Falou be “made aware of the seriousness of his actions” and be obliged to undergo medical treatment. The following month, the Bordeaux family court granted Pla custody of the couple’s four-year-old daughter, limiting Falou to supervised access for two hours every fortnight. On 1 July, less than two days after he was put under investigation for harassment and ordered not to go near Pla, he killed her. “They didn’t call to inform Sandra he was being let go under legal conditions. They sent a letter that we found in her postbox after she died,” Crozatier said. Last year, 136 women were killed by partners or ex-partners in France, a rise of more than 44% on 2023. In the last five years, the French state has faced several cases brought by victims’ families who accuse it of failing to act to prevent the killings. In June, the state was ordered to pay €27,000 (£23,000) to the family of Nathalie Debaillie, killed by her former partner in Lille in 2019. It is facing at least two other cases, not including Pla’s: the murder of Chahinez Daoud, 31, who was burned alive by her husband in 2021 and the killing of Patricia Gomit, 51, by her ex-partner in 2022. Bernard Grelon, the state’s legal representative in the Pla case, said: “The state’s legal representative is reserving his comments for the court and I have no statement to make prior to the hearing.” Pla’s mother said last year: “For my daughter it’s too late, but women are still being killed. I cannot sit back with my arms crossed and do nothing.”

8) ‘I watched the children uncurl’: people share stories of affordable UK camping holidays — The Guardian (2025-08-31)

   Text:
     Parenting in London can often be defined by “don’ts”, says Jen Ablitt, 48, who has a four-year-old daughter – “don’t touch that, stop there, don’t run”. But whenever they go camping in the countryside, she finds, for a city kid it’s a completely different realm. “Off they go, and you give them more freedom,” she says. Ablitt is one of many people taking a camping or caravanning holiday this summer, options that tend to be significantly cheaper than some other breaks while providing benefits such as proximity to nature. Camping and caravan holidays work out cheaper than other domestic accommodation types. With 62% of UK adults saying they’re currently spending cautiously or cutting back due to the cost of living crisis, according to the British Tourist Authority, cheaper holiday options are increasingly attractive. Dozens of people responded to a Guardian callout asking for their experiences of UK camping holidays. Here are some of their affordable tales of pitching up and switching off. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid that doesn’t love camping’ I was recently made redundant, and hopefully I’ll get a new full-time job, so this might be the last summer holiday where I can spend the entire six weeks with my daughter, who’s four. I rented our home out online and planned nearly three weeks staying with friends and camping: the Forest of Dean, the Peak District, the Lake District and north Wales. We camp a lot anyway – and started when she was 18 months old – so we’re used to it. I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid who doesn’t love camping. We’ve had a very cheap holiday – about £20 a night – more than paid for by the home rental money. But as a solo parent it has been exhausting to do all the driving, packing, camping, parenting, interspersed with house guest changeovers. Overall, I’m very glad I did it. Camping is a terrific way to see some truly gorgeous parts of the UK. Jen Ablitt, 48, south-west London ‘I watched the children uncurl’ I went camping for the first time in the Lee Valley this August – three mums and six kids – to try to give our city kids a taste of outdoor living, off their phones and out into nature. They’re teenagers, and most of them are glued to screens. We had looked at a few seaside holiday lets, but the prices – one place was £1,000 a week – were just too high. Cost was definitely a factor. It feels like UK seaside holidays are getting out of reach, whereas the campsite cost £140, including equipment hire, for two nights per family. It was camping for softies – none of us have camping equipment or tents, so we got to experience it without the stress of bringing endless bits. Only one of us has a car, so she drove with the luggage, and the rest of us got the train, which was only 20 minutes. We then walked 45 minutes along the River Lea to the campsite. It was brilliant that it wasn’t far. There were the initial complaints from the kids: “How long is this walk going to take? There’s no toilet in the tent. It’s cold at night. The shop doesn’t sell any good snacks.” It took about 24 hours, but I watched the children uncurl, and by the end of our stay they were all out playing frisbee, making fires, going on river walks, watching the ducks and climbing trees to get apples. Rebecca Lovell, small business owner, east London ‘On clear nights you could see the Milky Way’ This summer, I’ve reacquainted myself with low-tech camping and had two glorious weeks in Dumfries and Galloway. My family prefer more comfort and also have less spare time, so I went solo. I stayed at a family-owned farm campsite, which is in the Galloway Dark Sky area and close to lots of interesting attractions. This is my happy place. Each day was an early rise, including watching an uninterrupted sunrise on Midsummer Day from my tent. Most days I cycled around the quiet roads and trails. On clear nights you could see the Milky Way and millions of stars. For £17 a night, I got my pitch, free hot water and showers, a freezer for ice packs, and mains electricity to charge my phone and electric bike. It was amazing value and I had a great reception from the owners. The carbon footprint of these holidays was tiny: two cans of butane gas a week and 50 litres of petrol. The weather was kind, but then being retired I could pick my weeks to take advantage of the sunshine. As a solo holiday, there were many other folks around to chat with and share tips. I think these are the best holidays I can remember. Nick Norton, 70, retired business analyst, Glasgow ‘Camping offers the opportunity to be close to nature’ We took our two children to Coniston Water in the Lake District camping, We’re keen paddleboarders and kayakers. It did not disappoint and was only a two-hour journey from our home. We all enjoyed the water, with spectacular views. We played ball games on the camping pitch, made a lovely campfire under the stars and toasted marshmallows. Our children also enjoyed the brilliant tree swing each day. It was absolutely perfect, and all for £34 a night. As a family, we have enjoyed holidays to France, Finland, Scotland, Tunisia, Spain and Cornwall. Each holiday is unique so it’s hard to say how our camping trip compares, but we had just as much fun in the Lakes and felt really connected as a family. Camping offers the chance to be close to nature, and it is a great learning experience for children. We love that these kinds of holidays build character and resilience. Other holidays, you can end up fretting about a missed departure, getting lost or wondering whether you can afford to eat out. But when we got home from camping, we felt refreshed and relaxed.

9) Richard Tice hits back at C of E criticism of Reform immigration policy — The Guardian (2025-08-31)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/richard-tice-church-archbishop-criticism-reform-immigration-policy
   Text:
     Reform UK has engaged in a war of words with the Church of England over the party’s plans to deport all asylum seekers who arrive in small boats, after the church’s most senior bishop called the proposal “isolationist, short-term [and] kneejerk”. Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader, hit back against the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, on Sunday, accusing him of interfering in domestic politics. This week Nigel Farage, Reform’s leader, announced the party’s migration policy, under which Britain would leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and deport people who arrive or have recently arrived by small boat from France. Cottrell told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips: “We should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short-term, kneejerk – in this case, ‘send them home’. Mr Farage is saying the things he’s saying but he is not offering any long-term solution to the big issues which are convulsing our world, which lead to this.” Responding on the same show, Tice rejected the criticism and urged the bishop, who is the acting head of the church while it searches for a new archbishop of Canterbury, to stay out of migration policy. Asked which of Cottrell’s criticisms were wrong, Tice replied: “All of it’s wrong.” He said: “I enjoy the church, I believe in God. But the role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies.” Farage’s new asylum policy involves deporting asylum seekers who cross the Channel, even to countries such as Afghanistan and Eritrea. To do so, Reform is promising to take Britain out of the ECHR, the 1951 refugee convention, the UN convention against torture and the Council of Europe anti-trafficking convention. A Reform government would then send teams of immigration officials into communities across the country to find people who have settled here after arriving as irregular migrants and deport them as well. The party has struggled to answer detailed questions about how the policy would work and how much it would cost. Farage initially said women and children would be detained and deported as well as men, but a day later he appeared to row back on that, suggesting doing so was not “part of our plan”. Asked by the Guardian why he had costed the proposals at £10bn when a thinktank had priced a similar plan by his former colleague Rupert Lowe at £47.5bn, Farage responded: “Zia [Yusuf, the senior Reform official] is very good at maths.” Reform has also talked about deploying the navy to help it enforce its migration plans. Asked on Sunday whether its role would be simply to act as observers while small boats continued to cross, Tice replied: “Yes. In a sense, that’s what the Border Force are currently.” Reform is looking to keep the pressure on the government to close asylum hotels even after a court ruled that ministers could continue to use the Bell hotel in Epping to house people whose claims had not yet been processed. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said on Sunday that the government would look to close hotels in an “orderly” way by the end of the parliament. “We can’t end up with hundreds of people just out on the street because a hotel has closed,” she said. Separately, she appeared to put pressure on the prime minister and the chancellor to end the two-child benefit cap, which Cottrell warned was driving up child poverty. “I’m ashamed of the very high numbers of children growing up in poverty that we see in our country,” she said, adding that bringing that level down was “what I came into politics to do”. Asked specifically about the benefit cap, she said: “It’s not the only way we can lift children out of poverty, and of course, it does come with a big price tag. But we know that not acting also comes with serious consequences and impact too.”

10) Bullfights, ballet and hot jazz: inside Picasso’s scandalous theatre of sex and death — The Guardian (2025-08-31)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/31/pablo-picasso-theatre-dance-tate-modern-weeping-woman
   Text:
     She is called the Weeping Woman, but that is an understatement. She grinds her teeth on a handkerchief that’s like a jagged white-and-blue spearhead while her fingers claw at her face, tearing the flesh to expose her skull. Her chin is two grenades, her eyes are filled with horror – black silhouettes of planes are held in her transfixed eyeballs. They are the German bombers that attacked the Basque town Guernica on 26 April 1937. Picasso’s Weeping Woman was bought from him by the British surrealist Roland Penrose in November 1937, fresh off the easel. Fifty years later, his son gave it in lieu of tax to the Tate Gallery. Now it is about to star in a Tate Modern exhibition that showcases the museum’s Picasso collection, enhanced with terrific loans from the Musée Picasso in Paris. Weeping Woman is a hair-raising example of Picasso’s feel for drama. Tate Modern’s blockbuster, called Theatre Picasso, is “staged” rather than curated, by the contemporary film artist Wu Tsang and writer Enrique Fuenteblanca in a series of cabaret and theatre-like spaces they hope will give visitors “a rhythmic experience”. Picasso, says Tsang, anticipated “the fluid relationship that artists have today with performance”. He certainly loved a good show. Picasso’s passion for drama included a spectacle that ended in real bloodshed – bullfighting. The corridas fuelled some of his greatest art. Guernica evolved from visceral, densely compacted paintings he did in the 1930s of dying matadors, horses gored by bulls and the artist’s alter ego, the man-bull Minotaur. Yet he was equally at home at the ballet, creating sets and costumes for the production Parade in 1917 with Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie, and going on to collaborate with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. His first marriage in 1918 was to a dancer in the company, Olga Khokhlova – it was disastrous, and the artist’s treatment of women has in recent years been heavily scrutinised. The most gossipy exhibit in Theatre Picasso suggests he was an opera fan, too: in a clip from a movie shot by Man Ray, the stocky painter drags up as the opera heroine Carmen. “It’s a bit of a gem to me to see him with the mantilla and the cigar,” says Tsang. But it was his later fierce rejection of the world of ballet and high-society elegance that produced the greatest Picasso in the Tate collection. The Three Dancers, painted in 1925, is violent, apocalyptic and has never calmed down. It’s a drama we don’t fully understand but whose brutal denouement we watch like a stunned audience. It’s like a stage set, a room with a view, except beyond the windows, which are weirdly opaque, is only a blue Mediterranean sky of hard pigment suggesting unbreathable air. Life is a theatre, this painting suggests, where we move among fake furniture in an illusory set with no freedom or space. The people in The Three Dancers unleash themselves in Dionysian frenzy. The woman in the centre flings her arms in the air as she raises her head to the sky: she is dancing to hot jazz, surely, in 1925, the year The Great Gatsby was published. But this dance is lethal. You can feel it get faster and madder. On the left, a woman gyrates even more ecstatically, twisting over so there seems to be a round hole showing dead sky where her heart should be. Her face has the empty nose socket and eyes of a skull. On the right, a male dancer has a partly brown, partly white body, suggesting the multiculturalism of jazz, more embraced in 1920s France than the segregationist US – Josephine Baker first performed in Paris in October that year. The Three Dancers is one of Picasso’s crucial revolutionary works. He regarded it as better than Guernica and kept it with him until 1965, when he sold it directly to the Tate. With its flattened space and overlapping, hard-to-read images, the piece helped to revive cubism, an artistic experiment that seemed to be have ended by 1914, at the outbreak of the first world war. The movement, undertaken by Picasso and Georges Braque from 1907, had asked fundamental questions: what is the fabric of reality, and can art see it? By 1913, when Picasso collaged and drew Bottle of Vieux Marc, Glass, Guitar and Newspaper, he and Braque used real things in their art, inventing the appropriation of found materials as an artistic technique. Then came the war. Picasso stepped back from this dizzying demolition of art as Europeans then knew it. Some people even blamed the war on the chaos of cubism. By 1918, Picasso participated in the “Call to Order” movement that hoped to restore civilisation with a more traditionalist art. Seated Woman in a Chemise from 1923 is a captivating example of this quieter phase of his work: when Picasso chose to draw or paint “properly”, he could do so better than anyone. As he justifiably claimed, he was born with the talent of Raphael and had to learn to paint like a child. The fuse that set Picasso back on a revolutionary road came in 1924, when a younger group of artists, the surrealists, published their manifesto declaring that all creativity comes from the unconscious and erotic compulsion. The Three Dancers’ jazz age cocktail of cubism and the surrealist cult of desire liberated Picasso to create his most pungent artworks, including The Acrobat, a wondrous painting of an impossible body, and the rampant sculpture Cock (the bird, but it’s truly cocky). The early 1930s was also when he pursued sex as a Sadeian theatre and discovered cubism’s most shocking use – to show all a lover’s orifices at the same time. A dazzling work from this era is his 1936 print Faun Revealing a Sleeping Woman, in which he changes into a mythic creature looking at his lover with unabashed voyeurism. Picasso’s scandalous theatre of sex and death gave him the imaginative power to do what few other artists managed: make art that fought fascism. The year he painted Weeping Woman, there were bombers in his eyes. In his loft in a 17th-century building on Rue des Grands Augustins, Paris, he planned and executed the gut-wrenching Guernica, which he finished by early June and unveiled in July in the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris international exhibition. Picasso is certainly theatrical, but his true genre is tragedy. The Weeping Woman cannot stop herself seeing those murderous planes. The nightmare is turning her skin green, as if she rots. Yet a honeybee sucks from a tear: out of this paralysed rage, some hope might come, if people act. The Weeping Woman is often identified with his lover Dora Maar, but why are her fingers so chunky? They look more like Picasso’s. Just as he could imagine himself as Carmen, Picasso is the woman weeping, merging with Maar in grief for the murdered of Guernica and those yet to die in the age of total war. When I look at Guernica now I see Gaza, I see Ukraine. When I look at Picasso’s satirical strip The Dream and Lie of Franco, I see today’s far-right populists and new-style dictators. Picasso lived in a time of emergency and so, it seems, do we. He was far from a perfect human being in his private life. But he was ultimately a political artist who acted in history. On that stage he was on the side of the angels – and of the Weeping Woman. Scene setters: works from the Tate exhibition Bust of a Woman, 1909 Picasso was making sculpture for the first time, carving raw wooden images that pay homage to African art, when he painted this early cubist “portrait”. This woman has rough-hewn wooden body parts and a featureless face, as the artist takes apart the European belief that pictures must be clear, legible perspective windows on the world. Bottle of Vieux Marc, Glass, Guitar and Newspaper, 1913 For a cubist painting, this is easy to make sense of: the guitar body is a white silhouette, part of the glass is sketched beside it, and the bottle recognisable by “Vieux” on its label. But why did he paste in such an old (1883) sheet from Le Figaro? Perhaps it mourns a bohemian cafe lifestyle that was already old. The Three Dancers, 1925 Picasso signed this painting in 1965 when he sold it to the Tate – he’d kept it until then. He also revealed: “While I was painting this picture, an old friend of mine, Ramon Pichot, died and I have always felt that it should be called The Death of Pichot rather than The Three Dancers.” Pichot’s profile is the silhouette on the right of this jazz-age nightmare. The Acrobat, 1930 Picasso was fascinated by circus folk. These performers star in his early Rose Period paintings, holding horses, balancing on balls or gathering in a family group with a clown as its patriarch. Here, he purifies what it means to be an acrobat: this character is all arms and legs, with no torso, as it contorts inconceivably. The closed eyes tell us it’s a dream – this is a surrealist vision. Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, 1932 Cubism was often seen as ugly in its distortions of the human figure, but here Picasso uses it to glorify his lover Marie Thérèse-Walter, composing her face from two different views, full-on and in half-moon profile. He suggests she has got two personalities: one daylit, the other nocturnal, mysterious. Cock, 1932, cast 1952 Picasso was a brilliant sculptor in a casually magical way, as this incredibly alive, spiky creation illustrates. Perhaps it is now in his three-dimensional creations, from a bull’s head made from bike parts to a baboon incorporating his son’s toy car, that the infectious fun of his creativity and playfulness can be felt most. Weeping Woman, 1937 It was in the 1930s that Britain woke up to Picasso, and to modern art, of which he was the recognised leader. A generation galvanised by the Spanish civil war and angered by appeasement of Hitler responded to Picasso’s protest art. In 1939, Guernica was shown at the Whitechapel Gallery, while Weeping Woman came here permanently in the year it was painted. Theatre Picasso is at Tate Modern, London, from 17 September to 12 April.

11) Sally Phillips: ‘I saw Hugh Grant and I screamed. I was surprised he was human-size’ — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     What do people approach you about most: Smack the Pony, Bridget Jones, Alan Partridge or shoving cake into Alex Horne’s armpits? I profile them as they come up. If it’s a man about my age, it would normally be Alan Partridge. If it’s a man in his 30s, it might be Taskmaster or Veep. If it’s a woman, it’s harder to tell. Smack the Pony seems to be having a revival among women in their 20s but it could easily be Bridget Jones and Miranda. It’s starting to happen with Austin, too, which seems to be something that families watch together. You had a really strong Australian accent until you were 12. Can you do one now? Yeah, and I couldn’t hear it! My dad worked for British Airways and we lived in Sydney when I was growing up. I went to Queenwood, which is apparently very posh – thanks British Airways. I have really, really happy memories of that time. But I picked up an Australian accent and my family really teased me about it. It took me quite a long time to get rid of it. The weird thing is, for a while I was quite good at accents but the one I couldn’t do was Australian. Can you do an Australian accent now? [In an Australian accent] I don’t know. I think so? That’s pretty good. When you filmed season two of Austin, did you show Michael Theo around London? Yes I did! Michael came to stay with me. He had a list of things he wanted to do. I took him to the Science Museum and we saw the early steam engines. He was very excited by that. I don’t know why we went to Clapham Junction but we did and he was excited by that. We went round lots of cheese shops. Ben [Miller] took him to Aardman, which he loved. Michael wanted to see the Tower of London and I have a friend who is a Yeoman Warder – a Beefeater. His wife is a special needs mum and they live together in the tower. They are massive fans of Michael so they offered to give him a personal tour. I was like, I have aced this. And he didn’t like it! He knew he was supposed to like it. You go on a little conveyor belt past the crown jewels and he was going: “Why would anyone want to look at this stuff?” There’s some hilarious pictures of him standing on Anne Boleyn’s grave, which is in an area the public is not allowed in. And Michael was really deeply bored and couldn’t hide it. It was very funny – he laughs about it now. Before he came over, he said: “I’m looking forward to meeting English women because they’re gracious and classy.” And then he turned up and met us and at the end he was like: “I think I’m going to marry an Australian after all.” What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? The first time I met Hugh Grant was on the set of Notting Hill – from which I was cut, but I am on the DVD extras! The third assistant director and I were walking to set and the third AD said: “Do you know Hugh?” And I turned around and there was Hugh Grant. And I screamed! I think it was a size thing. He’s not particularly small but I was surprised he was the size of a human, I suppose. That was pretty uncool. What is the most enduring lesson from your time at clown school? I’ve been to lots of clown schools. They teach you that getting it wrong means you are getting it right. When you get something wrong, you seem vulnerable and people can connect with you. Showing your vulnerabilities is actually what everyone’s desperate for and you make it possible for other people to show their vulnerabilities. In jazz, they say if you just hold the wrong note it becomes right – I think we all need to hear that sometimes. I did a clown workshop recently and they applauded every time someone messed up. “This is how to live,” I thought. When you are rewarded with laughter and applause for how stupid you are – life would be much better if we could just do this. Do you have a nemesis? Do you mean an actor who gets jobs you’d like? Because I’ve engaged with parenting like a plough engages with a field – it’s been bumpy. My career choices sometimes haven’t been choices. So there’s not really people who got the thing that I think I should have got. But there are people who I wish I’d been a bit more like. I really admire Sharon Horgan because she had the balls to just do it and not take no for an answer. When I came into the industry you were told no in so many convincing forms that now we know were bollocks. It was just completely accepted that women weren’t as funny as men and that women weren’t as good on telly. I remember pitching a movie and saying: “So this woman is not that attractive –” and the guy said: “Can I stop you there – this is the movies. The least attractive I’m prepared to go is Kelly Macdonald.” And she’s the person who played the part! We were just told no all the time. I wish I’d had more courage. I wish I’d had more balls. That’s the wrong thing to say! I wish I’d been a bit more like Sharon Horgan. Do you believe in extraterrestrial life? I believe there could be something. If there’s infinite galaxies it would be ridiculous to say no! What is the weirdest thing you have done for love? It was 29 February. My partner and I had been together about six months, not that long. It wasn’t a real proposal but I thought I’d frighten him with a proposal in the least romantic place possible. So I got a massive paperweight that looked like a diamond and some chicken wire and made a massive ring. I got a food compost bag full of jelly hearts and lots of photographs of us on a little washing line. We were on a train going north and, as we left Milton Keynes – one of the least romantic places in the UK – I said: “Please don’t marry me.” Probably a bit weird in retrospect. He was frightened but a bit touched. He kept the ring! If you could change the size of any animal to keep as a pet, what would it be? I’ve always wanted a monkey. My dad used to have a monkey before I was born – he rescued a monkey off the streets in Borneo. They shit orange – I remember once having one on my shoulder and it shit orange all the way down my back. So I think I’d shrink the monkey small, in terms of poo management. A palm-sized monkey. What are you secretly really good at? I was the most insanely accomplished 18-year-old – I spoke two languages fluently and I played three instruments really well. But I’m now 55 and I haven’t really done any of that since. I’ve just been to France and I can barely string a sentence together. I got the flute out the other day and it was sad. I used to be good at stuff – does that count? Austin seasons one and two are available to stream on ABC iView in Australia, and season one is on BBC iPlayer in the UK.

12) Crystal Palace reject £35m Liverpool bid for England defender Marc Guéhi — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/30/crystal-palace-reject-35m-liverpool-bid-for-england-defender-marc-guehi
   Text:
     Crystal Palace are demanding that Liverpool increase their offer of £35m for Marc Guéhi to match their valuation of £40m for the England defender before sanctioning his departure. Liverpool are understood to have submitted an official bid for Guéhi on Saturday that was immediately countered by Palace. They want an initial £35m plus another £5m in bonuses and a 10% sell-on clause to be included in the deal, with talks continuing. Guéhi has less than 12 months remaining on his contract and has refused to sign an extension, with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, admitting after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community Shield that he may have to be sold this month to avoid losing the 25-year-old for free next summer. Liverpool are understood to be Guéhi’s preferred destination but the Premier League champions had yet to formalise their approach until Saturday afternoon. Palace are believed to be ready to allow him to depart if their valuation is met, despite Oliver Glasner saying on Friday that it was too late to sign a replacement, given the transfer window closes on Monday. Palace, who rejected a bid worth up to £70m for Guéhi from Tottenham in January, have been desperate to add defensive reinforcements amid uncertainty over his future and agreed a deal worth up to €27m (£23.4m) with Toulouse for Jaydee Canvot, with the France Under-20s defender expected to sign a five-year contract at Selhurst Park. Canvot is seen as a player with huge potential, having made his breakthrough in Ligue 1 last season. But the FA Cup winners have been frustrated so far in their efforts to find a more experienced replacement and Liverpool are believed to have rejected an approach to sign Joe Gomez on loan as part of the Guéhi deal. The England defender could still be available on a permanent deal, while Palace have been in talks with Manchester City over a move for Manuel Akanji but the Switzerland defender has interest from Milan so will likely move elsewhere. They have also made inquiries about taking former Southampton defender Mohammed Salisu on loan from Monaco. Glasner made it clear on Friday that he wants Guéhi to stay. “From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,” said the Palace manager. “When we see our foundation of success in the last few months, it’s our defence … Marc is a crucial part. Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.”

13) Seven Israeli soldiers wounded in explosion in Gaza City, IDF says — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     Seven Israeli soldiers were wounded in an explosion targeting an armoured vehicle in Gaza City on Friday night, the Israel Defense Forces have said. The soldiers were wounded while operating in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, which has been the site of intense Israeli military activity in recent weeks. Intense clashes in the area on Friday night were reported by Arab media, including Al Jazeera, which said that Hamas had attempted to kidnap some of the Israeli soldiers at the time of the explosion – reports the Israeli military said were false. Israel declared Gaza City a “dangerous combat zone” on Friday, ending the daily humanitarian pauses that were meant to alleviate hunger there. Gaza City is in the throes of famine, a result of an Israeli blockade that despite the pauses has choked off food and medical supplies into the territory. The Israeli defence ministry approved plans to occupy and take over Gaza City last week, and despite international and domestic opposition, is pushing ahead with the offensive. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants carried out an attack in southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. On Thursday, Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s military wing, warned that Israel’s plans to occupy Gaza City would increase the chances of the group capturing Israeli soldiers and that any Israeli military operation would put the lives of remaining hostages at risk. Before its offensive, the Israeli military is seeking to forcibly displace the residents of Gaza City to southern Gaza. Israeli bombardments of the area have intensified in recent days, with the Israeli air force carrying out strikes on tent encampments in Zeitoun and the al-Nasr neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. At least 62 Palestinians had been killed across Gaza in the previous 24 hours, Gaza’s health authorities said. The renewed bombardment has already caused more than 23,000 residents of Gaza City to leave, the UN said on Thursday. Gaza City hosts nearly half of Gaza’s 2 million population and is in the grip of famine. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that it would be impossible to keep these residents safe during a mass-displacement scenario. “It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,” said Mirjana Spoljaric in a statement on Saturday. She added that no other area in the Gaza Strip had the capacity to accommodate such a massive displacement, given the already dire shortages of food and shelter. Gaza’s health ministry reported on Saturday that 10 people had died as a result of starvation or malnutrition in the past 24 hours, including three children. Since the war beganin October 2023, 332 people have starved to death in Gaza – the majority of whom have died since July. Despite the worsening humanitarian crisis, Israel will soon slow or halt aid into parts of northern Gaza as it begins its Gaza City offensive, an Israeli official told the Associated Press on Saturday. The official said Israel would halt airdropped aid into Gaza City over the coming days and decrease the number of aid trucks that entered northern Gaza, even as the UN says the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is far below what is needed. The continued Israeli-aid blockade and planned Gaza City operation has drawn a global outcry, including condemnation by six European foreign ministers on Friday. Many EU member states, such as Ireland and Spain, have called for a suspension of the bloc’s free trade pact with Israel, but countries including Germany and Hungary are against this measure. On Saturday, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she was “not optimistic” that the EU would take any measures against Israel because of internal EU divisions. “I’m not very optimistic, and today we are definitely not going to adopt decisions … We are divided about this issue,” Kallas told journalists at a meeting in Denmark for foreign ministers to discuss suspending EU funding to Israeli startups. The proposal would require a voting majority in the bloc, something that the EU does not have. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Harris, said: “If the EU does not act as a collective now and take sanctions against Israel, whenever will it. What more could it possibly take? Children are starving.” As the EU debated taking steps against Israel, the US announced it would not allow the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to travel to New York next month for the UN general assembly. It also denied and revoked the visas of about 80 Palestinian officials. Abbas was due to attend a conference where Britain, France, Canada and Australia are expected to recognise a Palestinian state – a step opposed by the US and Israel. The step is unprecedented, as the US is obliged to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York under the 1947 UN headquarters agreement, except in the case of a security threat. The decision drew international condemnation, with the vice-president of the Palestinian Authority, Hussein al-Sheikh, calling it a clear violation of international law. EU foreign ministers urged the US to reconsider its decision to bar Palestinian officials from attending the UN general assembly, Kallas said on Saturday. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the decision “unjust” and expressed support in a phone call to Abbas. Palestine is a member of the UN and is a permanent observer state, allowing it to participate in the organisation’s proceedings.

14) Ukrainian lawmaker shot dead in Lviv as Zelenskyy says hunt for killer is under way – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     This blog will be closing shortly. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s Ukraine-Russia coverage here. Here is a summary of the key events from today’s live blog: Andriy Parubiy, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker, was shot dead in western city of Lviv on Saturday. Prosecutors have opened a murder investigation and said police were still searching for the shooter but have not mentioned possible motives at this stage. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned it as a “horrific murder” and said “all necessary forces and means” would be used in the investigation. By Saturday afternoon, tributes had come in from colleagues in Ukraine’s parliament and the government, praising Parubiy’s contribution to Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty and independence. Former president Petro Poroshenko said on Telegram that the killing of Parubiy, who was a member of the parliamentary committee on national security, defence and intelligence, was “a shot fired at the heart of Ukraine”. Iryna Herashchenko, a lawmaker from the European Solidarity party, described Parubiy as “one of the founders of the modern Ukraine … principled and decent, patriotic, intelligent”. In a statement on Telegram, foreign minister Andrii Sybiha described Parubiy as “a patriot and statesman” who “rightfully belongs in the history books”. Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko called for a prompt investigation of the murder, calling it “a profound loss” for the country. One person was killed and 24 were injured, including three children, in Zaporizhzhia after a Russian strike on a five-story residential building. Regional governor Ivan Fedorov said the attack on Zaporizhzhia cut power to 25,000 residents. The Ukrainian air force recorded five missile and 24 drone hits at seven locations with debris falling on 21 sites, according to a statement on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday. Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region came under a “massive attack” early on Saturday, the region’s governor said, reporting strikes in Dnipro and Pavlograd. “The region is under a massive attack. Explosions are being heard,” Sergiy Lysak wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. He said overnight Russian strikes killed two people in Dnipropetrovsk. On Saturday, in a post on X, Zelenskyy accused Moscow of using “the time meant for preparing a leaders-level meeting to organise new massive attacks” and called for “tougher” banking and energy sanctions on Russia. He said Russia’s latest attack had shown its “utter disregard”. Speaking after a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in the Danish capital Copenhagen, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she had asked EU governments to submit proposals next week for another package of sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine. The chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that Russian forces were conducting non-stop offensives along the entire frontline in Ukraine. Since March, Russia has captured more than 3,500 square km (1,351 square miles) of territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages, Gerasimov added. Ukrainian military said on Saturday that it had struck Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. Kyiv’s military recorded multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia’s south and said there was also a fire in the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara region. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one of the refinery’s units and a fire had broken out over an area measuring 300 square metres (3,230 square feet). That fire was later extinguished, authorities said. There were no casualties, and employees were evacuated, authorities wrote on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry said it had downed 11 Ukrainian drones over the Krasnodar region overnight. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday its troops had taken control of the village of Komyshuvakha in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The ministry said its forces had successfully carried out strikes with high-precision weapons on Ukrainian missile and aviation enterprises, as well as military airfields in Ukraine. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports. Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are among the world leaders who will attend a military parade with President Xi Jinping in Beijing next week, in a show of collective defiance amid western pressure. Against the backdrop of China’s growing military might during the Victory Day parade on 3 September, the three leaders will project a major show of solidarity. The Russian defence ministry said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian drones, including 18 over Moscow-annexed Crimea, between 4am and 8am GMT on Saturday. The other two drones were shot down over Russia’s western Smolensk region. In an earlier statement, Russia’s defence ministry said it had destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met the families of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine and offered condolences for their “unbearable pain”, state media said on Saturday. Pyongyang has not confirmed the number of its soldiers that died fighting for Russia, though Seoul estimates it is about 600, with thousands more wounded. Speaking after a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in the Danish capital Copenhagen, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she had asked EU governments to submit proposals next week for another package of sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine. A Russian overnight attack struck residential properties in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine leaving at least one person dead, according to officials. Footage released on Saturday by emergency services shows firefighters and paramedics fighting blazes in destroyed buildings and tending to residents: The chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that Russian forces were conducting non-stop offensives along the entire frontline in Ukraine, reports Reuters. In an address to his deputies published by Zvezda, the official outlet of the defence ministry, Gerasimov also said that Russia now controls 99.7% of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, 79% of the Donetsk region, 74% of the Zaporizhzhia region and 76% of the Kherson region. Since March, Russia has captured more than 3,500 square km (1,351 square miles) of territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages, Gerasimov added. Ruslan Stefanchuk, the current Ukrainian parliament speaker, has described Andriy Parubiy as a “consistent defender of Ukrainian statehood”, according to the Kyiv Independent. In a post on Facebook, translated in to English by the publication, Stefanchuk wrote: On behalf of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I express my condolences to Andrii’s family and friends. Here are some more images coming in from Zaporizhzhia today via the newswires: Reuters has a bit more background on the Ukrainian former parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy who was shot dead in Lviv on Saturday. Parubiy, 54, was a member of parliament and was parliamentary speaker from April 2016 to August 2019. He was one of the leaders of protests in 2013-14 calling for closer ties with the European Union. He was also secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council from February to August 2014, a period when fighting began in eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula. Ukraine has now officially launched a murder investigation into the shooting of former parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy. In a statement, the office of the the prosecutor general of Ukraine said the shooter was being sought for the “intentional homicide” of the well-known 54-year-old politician. More tributes are coming in from colleagues in Ukraine’s parliament and the government, praising Parubiy’s contribution to Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty and independence. Former president Petro Poroshenko said on Telegram that the killing of Parubiy, who was a member of the parliamentary committee on national security, defence and intelligence, was “a shot fired at the heart of Ukraine”. He said: Andriy was a great man and a true friend. That is why they take revenge, that is what they are afraid of. In a statement on Telegram, foreign minister Andrii Sybiha described Parubiy as “a patriot and statesman who made an enormous contribution to the defence of Ukraine’s freedom, independence and sovereignty. He was a man who rightfully belongs in the history books”. Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko called for a prompt investigation of the murder, calling it “a profound loss” for the country. She said: You always remained a patriot of Ukraine and made a great contribution to the formation of our state. Iryna Herashchenko, a lawmaker from the European Solidarity party, also confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that the victim of the shooting in Lviv was Andriy Parubiy. According to the publication, Heraschenko said in a statement published on European Solidarity’s Facebook page (written in Ukrainian but translated into English by the online newspaper): Our team is shocked. This is terror. Andrii was one of the founders of the modern Ukraine … principled and decent, patriotic, intelligent. The Kyiv Independent reports that authorities received an emergency call at around noon after the shooting in Lviv’s southern Frankivskyi city district. Police said the victim had died at the scene. According to the publication, officials have not commented on potential suspects or a possible motive. Andriy Parubiy, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker, has been shot dead in western city of Lviv, say officials. Confirming the news, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X: Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs Ihor Klymenko and prosecutor general Ruslan Kravchenko have just reported the first known circumstances of the horrendous murder in Lviv. Andriy Parubiy was killed. My condolences to his family and loved ones. All necessary forces and means are engaged in the investigation and search for the killer. We will update with more information as soon as possible. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday its troops had taken control of the village of Komyshuvakha in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, reports Reuters. The ministry said its forces had successfully carried out strikes with high-precision weapons on Ukrainian missile and aviation enterprises, as well as military airfields in Ukraine. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has thanked those working for Ukrainian security and developing its aviation in a post to mark Aviation Day. Every year on the last Saturday of August, Ukraine celebrates Aviation Day, a holiday to honour military and civilian pilots and aviation industry workers. In a post on X, Zelenskyy wote: Aviation Day. A day to honor those for whom the skies became their workplace, their dream, and their true calling. Military and civilian. Pilots, crews, engineers, designers, air traffic controllers, technicians – each of you is doing a tremendous job for Ukraine. Our sky is under your protection. I thank everyone who works for our security, for Ukraine’s strength in the air, and to all those developing our aviation. We will certainly do everything to ensure that Ukraine’s sky is peaceful and safe. Happy Aviation Day of Ukraine! Here are some images coming in via the newswires of Zaporizhzhia: Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are among the world leaders who will attend a military parade with President Xi Jinping in Beijing next week, in a show of collective defiance amid western pressure. No western leaders will be among the 26 foreign heads of state and government attending the parade next week – with the exception of Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia, a member of the European Union – according to the Chinese foreign ministry. Against the backdrop of China’s growing military might during the Victory Day parade on 3 September, the three leaders will project a major show of solidarity. Russia, which Beijing counts as a strategic partner, has been battered by multiple rounds of western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with its economy on the brink of slipping into recession. Putin, wanted by the international criminal court, last travelled in China in 2024. North Korea, a formal treaty ally of China’s, has been under UN security council sanctions since 2006 over its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Kim last visited China in January 2019. Those attending the parade marking the formal surrender of Japan during the second world war will include Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko, Iran’s president Masoud Pezashkian, Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto and South Korea’s National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik, said Chinese assistant foreign minister Hong Lei at a news conference. Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vucic will also attend the parade. The United Nations will be represented by under secretary general Li Junhua, who previously served in various capacities at the Chinese foreign ministry, including time as the Chinese ambassador to Italy, San Marino and Myanmar. The Russian defence ministry said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian drones, including 18 over Moscow-annexed Crimea, between 4am and 8am GMT on Saturday, reports Reuters. The other two drones were shot down over Russia’s western Smolensk region. In an earlier statement, Russia’s defence ministry said it had destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met the families of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine and offered condolences for their “unbearable pain”, state media said on Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Pyongyang has not confirmed the number of its soldiers that died fighting for Russia, though Seoul estimates it is about 600, with thousands more wounded. South Korean and western intelligence agencies have said North Korea sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in 2024 – primarily to the Kursk region – along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems. Kim gave a speech to the families on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, after meeting only some of them last week at another public ceremony awarding honors to the soldiers. According to KCNA, Kim said in his speech: I thought a lot about other martyrs’ families who were not present there. So, I had this meeting arranged as I wanted to meet and console the bereaved families of all the heroes and relieve them of their sorrow and anguish even a little. He pledged to erect a monument in the capital as well as a new street for the bereaved families, while the state would give full support to the troop’s children. He said: My heart breaks and aches more at the sight of those little children. I, our state and our army will take full responsibility for them and train them admirably as staunch and courageous fighters like their fathers. North Korea only confirmed it had deployed troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine in April and admitted that its soldiers had been killed in combat. Regional governor Ivan Fedorov said that three children were among the 24 injured in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after a Russian attack (see 8.59am BST). He confirmed that one person had been killed. The Ukrainian air force recorded five missile and 24 drone hits at seven locations with debris falling on 21 sites, according to the statement on the Telegram messaging app, reports Reuters. The attack on Zaporizhzhia cut power to 25,000 residents, Fedorov said. The local energy facility said the attack damaged its equipment and that repairs were under way. As of early Saturday, Ukrainian state-owned railway Ukrzaliznytsia said it had repaired the damage to its infrastructure in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian military said on Saturday that it had struck Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. Kyiv’s military recorded multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia’s south, which produces 3m tonnes of light petroleum products annually, reports Reuters. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one of the refinery’s units and a fire had broken out over an area measuring 300 square metres (3,230 square feet). That fire was later extinguished, authorities said. There were no casualties, and employees were evacuated, authorities wrote on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry said it had downed 11 Ukrainian drones over the Krasnodar region overnight. There was also a fire in the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara region, which had a processing capacity of 8.5m tonnes per year before August, the Ukrainian military said. Samara’s regional governor confirmed an attempt overnight to attack an industrial enterprise, but gave no further details. One person has died and dozens have been injured, including children, in Zaporizhzhia after a reported Russian strike on a five-story residential building, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday morning. “All emergency services are engaged at the site,” said Zelenskyy. He added that Volyn, Dnipro, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Rivne, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy, Chernivtsi and Chernihiv regions were all affected by the attack. “Numerous fires broke out, and civilian infrastructure – homes and businesses – suffered the most damage,” he said. According to Zelenskyy, Russia launched “nearly 540 drones, 8 ballistic missiles, and 37 other types of missiles against civilian life”. In a social media post on X, Zelenskyy wrote: We saw the world’s response to the previous strike. But now, as Russia once again shows its utter disregard for words, we count on real action. It is absolutely clear that Moscow used the time meant for preparing a leaders-level meeting to organise new massive attacks. The only way to reopen a window of opportunity for diplomacy is through tough measures against all those bankrolling the Russian army and effective sanctions against Moscow itself – banking and energy sanctions. This war won’t stop with political statements alone; real steps are needed. We expect action from the US, Europe, and the entire world. In other developments: Vladimir Putin will travel to China this weekend for what the Kremlin has called a “truly unprecedented” visit to his most important ally, which comes at a crunch moment in talks over Ukraine. Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region came under a “massive attack” early on Saturday, the region’s governor said, reporting strikes in Dnipro and Pavlograd. “The region is under a massive attack. Explosions are being heard,” Sergiy Lysak wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. He said overnight Russian strikes killed two people in Dnipropetrovsk, which had been largely spared from intense fighting since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Kyiv acknowledged on Tuesday that Russian troops had entered the region. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned that Donald Trump risked being “played” by Putin if a Russia-Ukraine peace summit did not go ahead. Macron expressed hope that the two-way meeting would take place but warned if Russia did not meet a Monday deadline to agree to the talks, “it will show again President Putin has played President Trump”. Zelenskyy said he expected to continue talks with European leaders next week on “Nato-like” commitments to protect Ukraine, adding that Trump should also be involved. “We need the architecture to be clear to everyone,” he said, adding that he wanted to tell Trump “how we see it”. EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen on Friday expressed “broad support” for expanding the bloc’s military training mission to operate inside Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said. “The EU has already trained over 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers,” Kallas wrote on X. “We must be ready to do more.”

     A man drove a car into a crowd outside a bar in northern France after a dispute in the early hours of Saturday morning, killing one person and injuring five others, according to prosecutors. The incident took place in the town of Évreux, Normandy, at about 4am. Authorities have launched an investigation into homicide and attempted homicide, with prosecutors saying they had ruled out terrorism as a motive. Police have taken two men and a woman into custody. “Unfortunately, the toll is very heavy,” Rémi Coutin, the local prosecutor, said. Of the five people who were injured, two were in critical condition. The attack took place after an altercation between a young woman and several men, Coutin said, with staff escorting the wine bar’s customers outside. The prosecutors said the altercation had “escalated and ended in a terrible tragedy” after a man entered a vehicle and “deliberately reversed at high speed into the crowd outside the establishment”. Guy Lefrand, the mayor of Évreux, said in a statement posted on social media: “This morning I was informed of a serious incident that occurred in front of La Winery on Winston Churchill avenue. A fight broke out, causing a crowd to erupt, and a vehicle struck several people.” Lefrand noted that one person had been killed and five others injured, and offered his condolences: “I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones.” Commending the emergency services and police for their response, the mayor added: “The situation has now returned to calm. An investigation is under way to establish the exact circumstances of this tragedy.”

16) ‘Garnet red with a delicious flavour’: the best supermarket strawberry jams, tasted and rated — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     Jam is a simple product: it’s mostly fruit and sugar with added pectin and sometimes citric acid, and it needs little else, so I tend to avoid any with unnecessary additives. Legally, it has to contain a minimum level of sugar, so when manufacturers use fruit juice concentrate instead of sugar, they often fall below that threshold and have to call their product a fruit spread instead. I tasted 10 jams straight from the jar, much to my teeth’s dismay, and then again spread on warm buttered baguette. Every product was delicious in its own right, but some really stood out as exceptional, with serious complexity and depth, and not overpowered by the sugar. Strawberries are among the most heavily sprayed crops in the UK, according to Pesticide Action Network’s “dirty dozen”, so I always look for organic strawberry products, especially in a concentrated one such as jam. Where the sugar content is notably high or low, I’ve also included the percentage of sugars. Sugar is integral to jam – it’s what preserves the fruit, after all – but in today’s health-conscious world, it’s worth knowing what you’re spreading. It’s also worth noting that there’s a trade-off for lower-sugar jams in that, once opened, they have a shorter shelf life. It’s also remarkable how many of these brands are steeped in history: Wilkin &amp; Sons started Tiptree jam back in 1885; Hartley’s was founded in Lancashire in 1871; St Dalfour was established in rural France at the turn of the 19th century; and Bonne Maman arrived in 1971. These are more than just spreads – they’re edible heritage. *** The best supermarket strawberry jam *** Best overall: Duchy Organic strawberry extra jam preserve £2 for 340g at Waitrose (59p/100g) ★★★★★ Mahogany red with deep flavour and a pleasantly sour twang, making it my favourite for both flavour and texture. Has a high sugar content of 65%, though. It contains perfect whole candied strawberries alongside others that have broken down into a jammy jelly. Really good value and organic, too! *** Best bargain: Morrisons the Best strawberry conserve £2.55 for 340g at Morrisons (75p/100g) ★★★★☆ A dark, vermilion hue with an archetypal strawberry flavour and good depth. Very sweet, with 59.3g carbohydrates per 100g, of which 57.5g are sugars. It has delicious bits and pieces of strawberries still half intact, giving a more textural finish. Overall, a great conserve for your money. *** And the rest … Fearne &amp; Rosie strawberry preserve £3.20 for 310g at Tesco (£1.03/100g) £3.20 for 310g at Ocado (£1.03/100g) ★★★★★ The colour of stewed forced rhubarb with a lovely clean berry flavour and balanced sourness. Much less sweet than most, it has an interesting, stewed fruit-like texture. Fearne &amp; Rosie is B Corp certified, and its strawberry preserve is manufactured in Belgium from EU produce. It has a high (70%) fruit content and low sugar (35%). Good quality for a natural-tasting fruit spread. *** St Dalfour strawberry spread £3.25 for 284g at Sainsbury’s (£1.14/100g) £3.40 for 284g at Waitrose (£1.20/100g) ★★★★☆ Crimson red with a familiar, candied strawberry flavour and decent texture, featuring nice pieces of strawberry. Less sweet than some, while still retaining a traditional taste. Made in Marmande, France, it uses regional fruit and natural sweeteners such as grape must (a waste product from the wine industry). Notably, the brand shares its sustainability efforts online. With a simple formula and slightly lower sugar content (48%) than many, this is a great buy. *** Clearspring organic strawberry fruit spread £3.50 for 280g at Ocado (£1.25/100g) ★★★★☆ Garnet red with a delicious strawberry flavour and just a hint of apple butter. Much less sweet than most, making this a great choice for family use. Sweetened naturally with apple juice concentrate and puree, it has very low sugar (29%). Despite being the most expensive in the test group, it’s still pretty good value, especially as an organic product. *** Bonne Maman strawberry conserve £3.30 for 370g at Morrisons (89p/100g) £3.30 for 370g at Tesco (89p/100g) ★★★☆☆ Apple-red colour with a quintessential strawberry flavour and a lovely varied texture. Recognisable by its handwritten font and gingham lid, Bonne Maman is sold globally in more than 100 countries. While provenance and sustainability details are scarce, this uses a simple, conventional recipe. *** Tiptree strawberry conserve £3.30 for 340g at Morrisons (97p/100g) £3.30 for 340g at Ocado (97p/100g) ★★★☆☆ Brick red with a traditional strawberry taste and a lovely texture featuring lots of seeds. This has a high sugar content of 66%, which is typical of more traditional recipes. *** Hartley’s best strawberry jam £1.70 for 340g at Morrisons (50p/100g) £1.70 for 340g at Iceland (50p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ A pinkish, burgundy red with a candied strawberry flavour and a sour punch, but rather lacking in nuance. Very sweet (59% sugar), too. A smooth, jelly-like texture dotted with seeds. That said, this has good heritage and is a fair price, too. *** Stute no sugar strawberry extra jam £2.65 for 430g at Sainsbury’s (62p/100g) £2.65 for 430g at Morrisons (62p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Candy red, with a traditional, sweet strawberry taste that has some sourness to balance things out. This sorbitol-sweetened jam (meaning it’s suitable for people with diabetes) has a smooth, jelly texture with some lumps and seeds. Based in Bristol since 1969, the brand is actively reducing emissions and producing 18% of its own electricity. With almost no sugar content (2.4%), it’s definitely a healthier option, although some consumers may be concerned about the use of sweetener. *** Mackays Scottish strawberry preserve £2.30 for 340g at Ocado (68p/100g) £2.30 for 340g at Tesco (68p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Ruby red with a familiar strawberry flavour that’s delicious, though not outstanding; very sweet, too, with a notably high sugar content of 66.9%. The texture is very sticky, though the inclusion of whole strawberries adds some interest. Founded in 1938, Mackays is one of the few products tested that states the fruit’s provenance, using Scottish-grown berries boiled in copper pans.

17) Never mind the flag bans, where are the policies? Assessing 100 days of Reform-led councils — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

   Text:
     “This motion is bizarre to say the least,” said a bemused Doncaster Labour councillor as Reform proposed that the council fly no flags apart from the union flag from its buildings. It would not just mean no Pride flag on Pride Day, a debate heard. It would mean no white rose flag on Yorkshire Day, no Rovers flag celebrating the football team winning the league, no St George’s flag marking England’s Lionesses’ Euros triumph, and no green flags celebrating municipal park management achievements in the city’s green spaces. The motion was “a waste of time and a waste of resources”, one councillor said. Meanwhile, at Nottinghamshire county council, climate change was being discussed. Bert Bingham is the Reform councillor now responsible for the council’s environmental policies. He does not believe human-made climate change exists, saying it is a “hoax” and that declaring a climate emergency is “ridiculous and nonsensical”. The media had brainwashed the public about the whole subject, he said. In Kent, a Reform councillor boasted about ensuring the removal of “trans-ideological material and books” from the children’s section of the county’s libraries. It later emerged the books were not there in the first place. In Durham, the Reform deputy council leader, a gay man, pledged that Durham Pride “won’t get a single penny from this council next year”. It received less than £10,000 from the council this year. Welcome to the world of local government in England after the success of Nigel Farage’s Reform party on 1 May this year. The party recently celebrated 100 days in power in local councils with an extensive press release trumpeting its work, including “rolling back the net zero agenda” and “flying patriotic flags”. It boasted of Staffordshire county council’s attempt to stop all solar, wind or battery farms, and Kent council cancelling climate-friendly property modifications, as well as other decisions including not upgrading buses to electric vehicles and scrapping EV charging points. Farage has been front and centre on the summer front pages, which aides said was part of a desire to look more prime ministerial, holding a press conference every Monday of the parliamentary recess. Here, he has announced a slew of defections, not only of former Tory MPs but a number of key local politicians, including a Tory police and crime commissioner and a member of the Scottish parliament. Though much of the national party focus has been on small boats and asylum hotels – particularly the controversy over the Bell hotel in Essex – Farage has begun to turn the national spotlight on to houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) used to accommodate asylum seekers. Reform councils are also beginning to emphasise these, setting up another potential national flashpoint. Durham and West Northamptonshire councils have begun crackdowns on the use and conversion of HMOs. Reform is on a high but how effective is it in power? Has anything changed for residents? Why did people vote for the party and what do they expect? Reform won outright majorities in Kent, Durham, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, North Northamptonshire, West Northamptonshire and Doncaster. In the Hull and East Yorkshire combined authority, Luke Campbell, a former Olympic boxer, was elected as its first mayor. The party was mostly wresting control from the Conservatives but election night was also terrible for Labour. In Durham, Reform succeeded a coalition of Liberal Democrats, independents and Conservatives in what was once a solid Labour stronghold. This year, Labour won four seats compared with Reform’s 65. To put that into perspective, in 2017 Labour had 94 of the council’s then 126 seats. It now has four of 98 seats. ‘Telling us like it is’ On the streets of Consett, once a proud, thriving steel town in County Durham, it is easy to find people who voted Reform. It is easy to find people who voted Labour at the general election. It is hard to find anyone who says they would vote for Keir Starmer’s Labour today. Corey Barron, 27, who was recently made redundant, said he used to vote Labour like all of his family. “Up here, all of us were Labour but look what has been done to the country in the past year,” he said. “Reform are the only ones telling us like it is. Labour have told us about a load of policies but haven’t stuck to them. Reform are the only ones being honest. People can see we need someone different.” Yvonne Hillier, a McDonald’s worker, said she was “Lib Dem through and through” but understood why so many people were voting Reform. Her two children, in their 20s, still live with her. “They just can’t afford to get on the housing ladder,” she said. “There are so many problems, so I can see why people voted Reform … but I couldn’t vote for them. I liked Nigel Farage in the jungle. I don’t like him the way he is now.” It is market day in Consett and there are just two stalls, including that of John Gardiner selling fruit, veg and flowers. “I’ve been coming 20 years and seen this street full, but not now,” he said. The farmer had always voted Conservative until May, when he voted Reform. “I think they [the Tories] are in a bit of a muddle at the moment, they need to sort themselves out. You just want anyone who gets in to do a good job.” Julie Walker, a receptionist and former Labour voter, ticked Reform for the first time at the council elections. “I just think we need somebody fresh and new,” she said. “I’m not a fan of Starmer, I just don’t think he cares what the average person thinks … immigration is a massive issue.” Many people the Guardian approached either said they had no interest or thought every party was as bad as the other. Of course, not everyone had voted Reform. “Are you fucking kidding me,” said Peter Wood when asked. “I blame the BBC for bringing Farage into the limelight.” His partner, Sheila Johnson, said she could not believe so many Reform councillors had been elected in Durham. “None of them have any experience. They don’t know what they are doing. God knows what’s going to happen.” Neither liked Starmer and both were thinking of supporting Jeremy Corbyn’s new party. As was Peter Monroe, a retired secondhand book dealer. “I disagree with all [Reform’s] policies,” he said. “I’m disheartened. The fact that Reform got in is terrible and it saddens me that it would happen in this strong, working-class area. “One of the first things they did when they got in at County Durham was ban flying the flag in solidarity with Ukraine at county hall. It was just wrong.” If an alien were to land in England this summer they would assume the English had an obsession with flags. Opposition councillors say flag policies have taken up an inordinate amount of debating time, and as how life has changed for residents, the answer is “not much”, they say. Some Reform councillors also acknowledge that. It will take time, they say. At the most recent full meeting of Warwickshire council, the Lib Dem councillor Sarah Boad complained of “stagnation … no ideas, no plans, except for silly, silly things that get press coverage but don’t actually help the residents of Warwickshire”. A clearly exasperated Reform councillor, Michael Bannister, replied: “We’ve been here two months and they want policy, policy, policy, policy.” The leader of Warwickshire council, an authority with a £2bn budget, is George Finch, a 19-year-old who still lives at home and cannot drive. Wits have invoked Pitt the Younger, or “young snotty” from Blackadder the Third, when writing about Finch, providing an excuse to repeat some of the character’s best lines: “My three main policy priorities are: one, war with France; two, tougher sentences for geography teachers; and three, a right royal kick of the prince’s backside!” Finch has called critics of his lack of experience “ageist”. He told the BBC: “All I see is age … I don’t care about my age. Would people be questioning if there was a 70-year-old at the helm? Probably not. Joe Biden, Donald Trump, presidents that are older – no one questions it. But they’re questioning someone who is 19.” At West Northamptonshire, the Conservatives laid out a formal motion addressing the lack of a corporate plan from Reform. There was “no vision, no manifesto, no plan” from Reform, said the Conservative councillor Daniel Lister. But the council’s Reform leader, Mark Arnull, told the BBC: “The danger when we write manifestos is that sometimes you have to keep to them.” ‘Doge’ units The “give us time” plea is one that has been expressed by a number of Reform councillors. Political observers say it is a message that comes from not having had firm plans in the first place. Colin Talbot, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of Manchester, said: “I went through Reform’s national policy statements and they had no policies whatsoever on local government. Nothing at all. They really haven’t thought about local government and what they want to do with it.” In speeches before the election, Farage spoke of fixing a broken Britain, which included “broken councils”. On 2 May, he warned that council staff working on diversity or climate change initiatives should be “seeking alternative careers”. The party has pledged to save money by sending in an Elon Musk-style “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit to examine all council spending in the areas it controls. It would use artificial intelligence, advanced data analysis tools and forensic auditing techniques to “identify wasteful spending and recommend actionable solutions”. Talbot said he believed there was little scope for any major savings because councils had already gone through more than a decade of austerity. “There is nothing left to cut, basically.” He said the 10 councils Reform had control of had already agreed to savings totalling £500m because of the extreme financial pressure on local government. And even if they find possible savings, Reform’s “Doge units” might find it tricky to force through cuts. “These units are not part of the council,” Talbot said. “They’ve not been authorised by the council. They are Reform entities and they’ve got no legal standing with the council. I suspect council officials will put up roadblocks to them getting access to data and so on, unless they’re instructed to by Reform councillors. “Even then, I suspect they’ll be open to legal challenge if it involves handing over things like people’s personal data about their council taxes and so on. So they’re pretty hemmed in.” If anything, Reform has been accused of costing taxpayers money because of several byelections being held since May after its councillors stepped down for various reasons. Each byelection is estimated to cost councils £25,000. In Nottinghamshire, a Reform councillor quit after six days because, a full council meeting heard, “he realised he wasn’t up for the job”. A Conservative won the byelection. In Durham, a Reform councillor resigned after a week for failing to declare he worked for the council. A Lib Dem councillor was elected in his place. That is not to say the Reform bandwagon has stopped. Its candidates have won other byelections caused by resignations and the party also gained its first council seat at the polls in London – Alan Cook won a Bromley byelection from a turnout of 28%. ‘Wrong side of the tide’ Reform continues to perform strongly in opinion polls, and many on the left and centre are worried. Talbot, who has experience of many elections over the decades, said Reform’s May victories needed to be treated with caution. “They have established quite a strong beachhead in local government,” he said. “However, beachhead is probably the right word because they’re on the wrong side of the tide. More than half of the councils they’ve taken over are top-tier county councils, which are due to disappear under the local government reorganisation.” Talbot said Reform’s success came from protest votes. “They only do well when they are standing for impotent levels of government, so Ukip did well when they stood for the European parliament. But when it comes to central government, actual elections not polls, they tend to do not very well at all. “Also, there aren’t any local charismatic leaders coming out of any of this. Reform isn’t the sort of party which would encourage that anyway … it’s Farage’s party. You can’t imagine anyone challenging him, whereas you can in the Lib Dems, Tories or Labour.” More than 100 days into their tenure, Reform councils have faced hundreds of protesters outside full meetings. In Durham, they were casually dismissed by the deputy leader, Darren Grimes, as “the jobless masses”. Inside council chambers, Reform councillors are going out of their way to present a united front. In Durham, they posed for an awkward group photo wearing “Make Durham Great Again” baseball caps. How long can they stay united? Will Reform councils go the way of the only Ukip-led council, Thanet, where in 2015 the party lost its majority after less than five months because of splits. “They are, by nature, a bunch of mavericks and protesters and dissidents,” Talbot said. “They very quickly fall out with each other usually … there is no cultural cohesion to them as a party. They tend to fall apart very quickly.”

18) Women’s Rugby World Cup needs jeopardy to stay in Monday morning conversations | Andy Bull — The Guardian (2025-08-30)

     After all these years of asking for more, it’s churlish to complain when the Women’s Rugby World Cup delivered so much in one weekend. England’s victory pulled in two-and-half million prime time viewers on the BBC, 85,000 fans turned out across the four grounds, including a record-breaking 42,000 crowd in Sunderland, five hat-tricks, four packed fan zones, free concerts, and all those fireworks. It had almost everything anyone could have wanted. Almost. The one thing missing was a tight finish. The closest of the eight games was settled by three tries and change. The success of the World Cup isn’t just going to be measured by what happens on the weekends, but in the days in between them. World Rugby wants people to be talking about this tournament when they go into work on Monday morning. And for that to happen it needs some jeopardy. There were 72 tries in eight matches altogether, but 66 of them were by the winning team. England scored 11, so did Australia and Canada. South Africa scored 10. New Zealand eight. Blowouts happen in the pool stages of every Rugby World Cup: there were a bunch of one-sided matches in the men’s tournament two years ago, when France beat Namibia 96-0, New Zealand scored 96 against Italy and Ireland defeated Romania 82-8. The difference this time was in what happened in between. The matches that we hoped would be close turned out anything but, with Scotland beating Wales 38-8 and France beating Italy 24-0. Which didn’t surprise anyone who regularly watches women’s rugby, but maybe requires some explaining to the huge new audience who are only just discovering it. “The numbers don’t always tell the full story,” said World Rugby’s director of women’s rugby, Sally Horrox, when she was asked about it this week. Horrox argues that 49% of women’s rugby fans have come to it in the past two years regardless of how uneven the standard. These scorelines don’t necessarily stop the games from being entertaining. And she’s right, the Red Roses’ victory was as good as a one-sided game gets. No one at the stadium felt it suffered from being so predictable. Like the competition director, Yvonne Nolan, said, there was a lot of “fast, free-flowing rugby”, and plenty to admire in the way the losing teams played. But it’s true, too, that no amount of fireworks or free concerts can disguise the gaps between some of these teams. Women’s rugby needs the enthusiastic support of the media as it grows; its lack of visibility is, World Rugby argues, the biggest obstacle to its success. So there are good reasons why a lot of what is written and said about the women’s game tends to gloss over the obvious imbalances between the teams. The irony is that it’s a sign a sport has matured that everyone involved is able to be honest about what everyone’s watching, instead of celebrating the simple fact that so many people are. To their credit, Horrox and Nolan are both too smart to pretend anything else. They don’t shy away from speaking about the lopsided results, which are inevitable given the uneven pace of development in women’s game around the world. “These teams,” as Nolan says, “are all at different stages of their journey.” Women’s rugby is growing so quickly that the gaps between the teams are actually wider now than they were during the first tournament, back in 1991 (when only one match ended with a 50-point margin) because a handful of sides, and England in particular, have raced so far ahead. This Saturday, a Red Roses side, who have the benefit of all the expert coaching, medical support and sport science the Rugby Football Union can provide and who, because the country has one of the two professional domestic leagues in the world, are paid to play and train seven days a week, take on Samoa, who don’t even have national contracts, and whose team include a full-time property manager, police officer and primary school teacher, who all had to rely on donations to cover the lost income they have suffered by missing work to compete in England. Which invites the question of which is the better achievement, an overwhelming victory for the professionals or an honourable defeat for the amateurs? If they’re honest, the Red Roses will know that given their pedigree and the resources at their disposal, they made too many basic mistakes even when they beat the USA by 62 points. And that, too, may be the result of the fact that they have had so few close matches in recent years that they have been able to get away with being sloppy. World Rugby is doing what it can to help narrow the gap. It has provided all the smaller teams with access to a pool of nine specialist coaches, who work across set pieces, skills, and strength and conditioning, Alain Rolland has been brought in to work with them on how to reduce their penalty counts. But they can’t cover everything. Even Canada, who are one of the strongest teams in this tournament, had to crowdfund the last $1m of the $3.2m they needed to compete. But in the long term, a lot of this will come down to the hard work of widespread structural change, the small steps forward in between the tournaments, as well as the great leaps made during them.

     Going out: Cinema Caught Stealing Out now Darren Aronofsky (The Whale, Black Swan) is back, with an adaptation of the first of Charlie Huston’s novels about former baseball player Hank Thompson, played here by Austin Butler, who is unwittingly drawn into the criminal underworld of 1990s New York when a cat-sitting job goes awry. The Roses Out now Having a bash at rerunning a classic, this new take on the Wars of the Roses draws on both the 1981 novel and the 1989 Kathleen Turner v Michael Douglas big-screen adaptation. Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch star as the wealthy couple whose divorce turns increasingly ugly, with darkly comic consequences. Young Mothers Out now Belgian brothers the Dardennes are noted for their humane, realist approach to telling ordinary people’s stories. Their latest focuses on young mothers Jessica, Perla, Julie, Naïma and Ariane and their children, and won the screenplay prize at Cannes this year. Dogtooth: 4k Restoration Out now Back in 2009, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos became internationally recognised with this shocking Oscar-nominated third feature. Since then he’s been continuously serving, with the likes of The Favourite and Poor Things, but this stunning black comedy of familial dysfunction, in which a couple keep their children intentionally ignorant of the outside world, is one of his very best.

20) ‘La tapisserie, c’est moi’: Macron accused of putting politics first in Bayeux tapestry loan — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/30/emmanuel-macron-bayeux-tapestry-loan-british-museum-petition
   Text:
     The Bayeux tapestry is so fragile that transporting it risks irreparable damage, French experts have said, as a petition urging Emmanuel Macron to reverse a “catastrophic” decision to loan the unique embroidery to Britain passed 60,000 signatures. France’s president declared in July that the nearly 1,000-year-old, 70-metre-long wool-on-linen artwork, which depicts William the Conqueror’s victory over King Harold II of England at Hastings in 1066, would cross the Channel next year. For nine months from September 2026, it is due to be on display at the British Museum, whose director, Nicholas Cullinan, has called it “one of the most important and unique cultural artefacts in the world”, symbolic of a millennium of shared history between Britain and France. Expert studies and conservators who have worked on the embroidery, however, say it is so fragile as to be essentially untransportable, and the organiser of a campaign against the loan argues Macron has ignored near-unanimous specialist advice for a grand political gesture. “I’m not against the loan of cultural artefacts and I have always liked the UK,” said Didier Rykner, the editorial director of La Tribune de l’Art, an art news website, whose month-old petition against the loan has been signed by nearly 62,000 people. “But this is a purely political decision. Here is an extraordinary work of art, a wholly unique historical document, an artefact without equivalent anywhere – and which expert opinion agrees, overwhelmingly, cannot travel. It’s not complicated.” Macron first suggested lending the Bayeux tapestry to the UK – as previously requested by London, and rejected by Paris, for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 and, in 1966, for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings – in 2018. Conceived as the sort of momentous cultural offer that might help sustain British ties to the continent even as it was preparing to quit the EU, the plan foundered as cross-Channel relations soured during the bitter Brexit negotiations and their aftermath. The idea was resurrected as relations gradually improved after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss left Downing St, and accelerated with Keir Starmer’s EU “reset”. French officials say King Charles was also instrumental and personally “very supportive” of the plan. But the loan agreement to celebrate cross-Channel reconciliation – which will also involve French museums displaying artefacts from the Anglo-Saxon burial site Sutton Hoo, and the Lewis Chessmen – ignores decades of warnings about the state of the tapestry. Housed since 1983 in a purpose-built museum in Bayeux due to close next month for a major two-year renovation, the fabric has been severely weakened by age but also, experts say, by being displayed suspended from a rail, rather than laid out flat. Some of the most damning arguments against the plan have come from curators and restorers who have worked or are working on the tapestry, five of whom have told Rykner – on condition of anonymity – of their disbelief and concern. Precisely because the tapestry was considered too fragile to move far, complex plans were already under way to remove it from display and store it during the museum’s rebuilding work, with a full restoration to follow once it was returned. “We fell off our chairs when we heard,” said one conservator. “It’s the opposite of all we had prepared for.” Any movement at all of the canvas, in a state of “absolute fragility”, was “fraught with risk, an incredibly delicate operation”, said another. Now the embroidery is set to be carried over a distance of possibly more than 500km (310 miles) “in its most fragile state, with its stabilising lining already removed, and before its restoration”, said a third. All emphasised that thousands of existing weak spots would be strained, with every movement risking tears, and it seemed almost impossible that what would have to be an entirely new system of transporting the tapestry could be designed in time. “It’s discrediting our profession,” one said. “Not listening to us is like saying we’re useless.” A rare conservator to speak publicly, Thalia Bajon Bouzid, said any damage would be irreversible: “Tears would not be repaired, for reasons of authenticity.” The conservators’ fears echo multiple previous expert warnings. As early as 2018, Antoine Verney, the chief curator at the Bayeux Museum, said he “could not conceive” of it being moved far. A report by eight antique textile experts in 2020 recommended a full restoration, identifying 24,204 stains, 16,445 creases, 9,646 deficiencies and 30 “non-stabilised” tears, and a pre-restoration study in 2021 “advised strongly against transporting the tapestry over a long distance (for more than an hour)”. That study added: “The longer the timeframe for micro-alterations to occur, the greater the risk that visible and irreversible alterations will appear”, especially since “no vibration-absorption system currently exists that can eliminate all risk during transportation”. Yet another analysis the following year reached much the same conclusion, according to Le Monde – but remains confidential except to companies submitting tenders for a full feasibility study into the tapestry’s proposed removal to London, Rykner said. So far, the French government has barely acknowledged the experts’ concerns. Macron went out of his way to dismiss them, saying in July that France had “found the best experts of the world to explain in perfect detail” why the loan “was impossible”, but “we decided” otherwise. Philippe Bélaval, the president’s special adviser on the project, has insisted the tapestry is “absolutely not untransportable”, referring to an “extremely precise” – but confidential – report from early this year detailing what precautions must be taken. “Playing with words,” said Rykner. “The transport had already been decided, so it was not the job of this report – about which we know strictly nothing – to argue against it. Any artwork is transportable. The question is, in what condition will it arrive?” The fact of the matter, Rykner said, was that Macron, famously enamoured of both the grand theatrical gesture and making his own decisions, had placed politics over the conservation of an exceptionally vulnerable piece of cultural heritage. One of the tender documents related to the loan, Rykner said, contained what was probably a mistake, but a revealing one: “The loan of the Bayeux tapestry has been granted”, it reads, “by the President of the Republic, owner of the work …” In the 17th century, Louis XIV, the Sun King, apocryphally said: ‘“L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state.”) This, Rykner said, was a case of “‘La tapisserie, c’est moi.’ It’s outrageous, and people are starting to see why it must be stopped.”

21) My favourite childhood outfit: ‘I liked this M&S jacket so much I’ve bought a vintage one for my daughter’ — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/30/my-favourite-childhood-outfit-i-liked-this-ms-jacket-so-much-ive-bought-a-vintage-one-for-my-daughter
   Text:
     I’m not saying I peaked at two, but I certainly gave myself an uphill struggle. This jacket was from M&amp;S, or St Michael to be precise. Bomber-style, it was white cotton with red, blue and yellow stripes. It was jolly and innocent in the way of a deckchair, and I appear to have worn it a lot in 1986 and 1987, with mustard dungarees, or shorts and T-shirts in clashing prints. On my feet, I am often pictured wearing scuffed white trainers or a pair of T-bar shoes that are still stashed away in an attic in Sheffield. They were my first proper pair of shoes and, as I would tell anyone who would listen, they were burgundy, not red. I was too young then to be able to remember anything concrete from this period, and what I can recall is filtered through grainy family photo albums: vast, northern French skies and wide sandy beaches, jellies (the shoes) and Calippos. My dad’s BMW, the smell of his cigar smoke clinging to the leather seats and the packet of Soft Mints that was always in the glovebox. Crazy golf and grownups’ parties where women in mists of perfume laughed raucously about things I couldn’t understand. I wore this jacket to meet Bertie Bassett, a figure whose pink face and liquorice nose loomed large over my childhood because my mum worked for the company. No wonder it reminds me of the carefreeness of being two, or three, or four. But I think what I love the most about this look is what I love about a lot of children’s clothes: it’s not just the garments themselves but the way they get worn, truly worn. Outfits get thrown together at that age; kids don’t “curate”, they chuck. Sequin frocks over jogging bottoms; straw hats that need to be worn on a cold day in December with a snowsuit; orange teamed unapologetically with red, pink and an exclamation of purple. This jacket speaks to a time before my awkward preteen years and my mistaken belief that shin pads were an acceptable everyday accessory, with or without the full Sheffield Wednesday strip. It also speaks to the present because once, scrolling Vinted late at night while feeding my few-month-old daughter, I found the same jacket for sale. It was marked up as “vintage” and going for a silly amount; old St Michael’s is sought-after stuff. I bought it regardless and my daughter Olive has since worn it while learning to scoot, dribbling her way through strawberry lollies and sitting on the same overcast beaches in northern France. I like this idea of clothes as an echo of the past, even if it seems a lot to load on to a jacket. Plus, the way Olive wears it, wears everything, speaks to that unabashed confidence of childhood. This morning, for nursery, it was paired with a dinosaur T-shirt with a tutu and Crocs. Olive swaggers like she has dancehall running through her head; no doubt, no fear. I could use a bit of that. If only they did the jacket in my size.

22) ‘Far more dangerous than war’: Iranians brace for prospect of UN sanctions — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/30/far-more-dangerous-than-war-iranians-brace-for-prospect-of-un-sanctions
   Text:
     As the worshippers streamed into the vast Grand Mosalla mosque in central Tehran to hear a call to prayer, the mood was one of determination, and some trepidation, as they faced the real prospect of UN sanctions in 30 days and even a rerun of the 12-day war with Israel. With guards watching, a worshipper giving his name simply as Mousavi said: “The reality is that many countries have nuclear power and are not subject to these rules but Iran is singled out for controls because we oppose Israel. We are dealt with in a different way because of our foreign policy. “But an economic avalanche is looming with these UN sanctions – they are very different from what has happened before – and that means even more economic adversity will only impoverish us more. So I think we have to relent a little. We have to let the UN inspectors in. There is probably not much nuclear material for them to see.” But that is far from the universal view, reflecting the politics of a mosque associated with hardliners and closely involved in the burial ceremonies of the previous president Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash that some Iranians still insist was not caused by bad weather but by sabotage by the Mossad. Rajabi Seddequi, also fatalistic as he headed across the boiling and dusty car park towards the mosque, said: “For 40 years we have become familiar with sanctions. They did not break us. They made us more resilient. Life has gone on. It does not bother us whether they are UN or US sanctions. If we have to choose between war and the entry of the UN inspectors, we will choose war. We will protect Iran and Islam.” A third worshipper, Ibrahim Heshmati, smiled as he insisted: “If there is a second war, this time it will be all the way to Israel. We stopped too early last time and we have the missiles to do this. “How can we trust a country like the US since we were in the middle of negotiations when they allowed Israel to attack us? If they did not claim we were making nuclear weapons they would find another pretext,” he added. “If there is a war we have to face the consequences. This is both a war of religion and war between states. We have nothing to fear.” Akbar Babaye, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, remembered: “Iran was alone before, facing US Awacs, French Mirage jets, T-72 tanks from Russia. We had 22 countries against us and alone we won. “Every government has underestimated our resilience. We are not going to back down. Next time Israel is going to be completely destroyed. A third of the population of 90 million are ready to go to war, and we are not afraid of death because when we die we will go to heaven because we are oppressed by the oppressors. The Israelis will not.” In Qom, Hashem Hosseini Bushehri, the Friday prayer leader, denounced Israeli oppression at length. He said: “We too must stand against Israel’s crimes with initiative and resistance, just like the people of Yemen, so that life in Gaza can continue.” The sentiments expressed show how hard domestically it will be for a divided Iranian government to make the kind of concessions the European governments are demanding. Radicals in the parliament are planning to table new laws calling for Iran to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but that decision in practice may be the prerogative of the supreme leader, and would lead to a massive internal political battle about the direction of Iran. Iran has been in a state of neither war nor peace since the 12-day war ended with a ceasefire that left the Iranian nuclear programme largely destroyed. Europe has given notice that it will snap back the sanctions unless the UN nuclear inspectorate is readmitted to all of Iran’s nuclear sites, and not just those that were not attacked by Israel. Tehran has said it is willing to negotiate the modalities of the inspector’s return, but western diplomats, confident they have the legal and political base to act, say they have been given nothing substantive about how these inspections will work in practice. The Iranian foreign ministry insisted the European powers had no legal basis to act. The European diplomats believe Iran fears independent confirmation that its 30-year nuclear programme has been destroyed by Israeli bombing, which could prompt a backlash from a population angry at the sacrifice of withstanding sanctions for no purpose. Iranian diplomats say they will spell out their likely reprisals if the UK, France and Germany press ahead with reimposing sanctions. Separately, behind closed doors, at the UN headquarters in New York, the UK and French delegations were briefing fellow diplomats about how the unprecedented snapback procedure would work. Some politicians say the impact of the sanctions will be limited since they were foreseen. Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer and Nobel peace prize winner, wrote on Instagram that the consequences of sanctions will be “far more dangerous than war” for Iran. She predicted the value of the national currency would fall even further, infrastructure would fail, poverty would increase, and social crises would spread, adding that the Islamic republic was the main culprit of this situation. Iran is also debating the impact of the return of the sanction resolutions that do not directly target Iran’s oil, gas and petrochemical industries or even banks and financial institutions. Most of these resolutions impose restrictions in the military and nuclear industries, especially on the buying and selling of weapons, and call on governments to exercise greater oversight and monitoring of Iran’s transactions and shipments to prevent their use in developing Iran’s nuclear and missile industries. In a wider political change, if the sanctions are reinstated Iran will be recognised as a country violating international laws and subject to chapter seven of the UN charter. Iran’s entire nuclear programme will be declared illegal.

23) ‘Jeff Buckley was a once-in-a-lifetime’: Australia’s 30-year love affair with an enduring, tragic talent — The Guardian (2025-08-30)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/30/jeff-buckley-30-year-anniversary-first-australia-tour
   Text:
     You had to see Jeff Buckley to believe him. Jon Pope, a veteran of the Australian music industry, was tour manager for the singer on his first visit to Australia, in 1995. Three days after Buckley’s first show at the Metro in Sydney on 28 August, the road crew were preparing for a much more intimate gig at the Lounge in Melbourne for an audience of a few hundred. Pope had an unusual request to make, per Buckley’s management. “You know those old cash registers that would go ‘ping’ when the tray would pop out? I had to tell them to turn them all off,” he remembers, laughing. The bar manager was aghast. “You’ll understand why when he starts playing,” Pope tried to reassure him. When Buckley and his band took the stage, the effectiveness of the edict became apparent. Buckley’s voice, and his band, soared and swooped. It was a masterclass in dynamics: in the silences between and sometimes during songs (the brief drop-out in So Real, for example), you could hear the proverbial pin drop. It is now 30 years since that first tour by Buckley to Australia (where his career first began to gain international traction) and 31 years since the release of his only finished album, Grace. The anniversary coincides with a revival of interest in Buckley, with a documentary, It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley, showing first at Sundance and the Melbourne international film festival earlier this month. And in September, singer Katie Noonan is touring a 20-date Buckley tribute show, with shows at Melbourne’s Hamer Hall and Sydney’s Enmore theatre already sold out. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As an 18-year-old, Noonan saw Buckley for the first and only time on his second and last tour of Australia, in February 1996. “I had never heard a voice used that way – never before, never since,” she says. “He was a once-in-a-lifetime.” Buckley’s death in 1997 at the age of 30 (an impromptu swim in the Wolf River in Memphis ended tragically when he was dragged underwater by a passing tugboat and drowned) has left a difficult legacy. A contentious unfinished album, Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, was released in 1998, followed by a seemingly endless stream of live recordings and assorted barrel-scrapings. Those live recordings are almost all variations of the songs Buckley recorded for Grace, one of the most acclaimed albums of the last three decades. Buckley simply didn’t live long enough to fulfil his enormous talent. Overfamiliarity has bred a degree of contempt. So too the many pale imitators, not to mention the buskers laying waste to his version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah on seemingly every street corner. As a witness to those shows though, I can confirm: Buckley was the real deal. A few days after his performance at the Lounge, I drove 13 hours from Brisbane to Sydney to see the last gig of the tour at the Phoenician Club, recorded by Triple J for Live at the Wireless. (I still give thanks to my then-partner, who brazenly purchased our tickets before we were officially an item.) He had it all. He could sing like a bird, he was a great guitar player, he was a superb bandleader, he had the songs (Lover, You Should Have Come Over sounded like an instant standard). He was also a gifted interpreter of other artists’ material: no one else could tear through the MC5’s Kick Out the Jams, then slip effortlessly into Nina Simone’s crushing Lilac Wine. It didn’t hurt, of course, that he was terribly good-looking. Warwick Brown, who runs the Melbourne record emporium Greville Records, was an early convert. Already a fan of Buckley’s father Tim, he’d heard Jeff’s first release, the EP Live at Sin-é, before Grace appeared in August 1994. “The day it came in, we stayed back after work to smoke a joint and lie on the floor and listen to it,” he remembers. “It just blew our minds.” Brown points out that if Buckley isn’t exactly a hip name to drop now, he wasn’t at the time, either. Coming at the tail end of grunge, Buckley was covering Van Morrison, Édith Piaf, even Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Alongside Hallelujah and Lilac Wine, Grace also featured a rendition of Benjamin Britten’s Corpus Christi Carol as delicate as gossamer. But it wasn’t an instant hit. “It was the sort of record you had to turn people on to, which is hard to believe these days,” Brown remembers. The Lounge show was full of hardcore music nerds, so perhaps Buckley was preaching to the choir, but once the show finished, “everyone was a fanatic”. By the time his Australian tour finished at the Phoenician Club, he was a star. Six months later, Buckley was back in Australia, playing more shows to much bigger rooms. “We tripled the audience,” Pope says. It was unusual for an international artist to return to Australia within such a short time frame, but Australia (and increasingly France) remained his stronghold. Back in the United States, he was still a cult act. Noonan drove from Brisbane down to Seagulls, a sports club on the Gold Coast, to see him: “It was a hugely transformative event in my life. I just went, whatever this band is doing, I want to do that, whatever that is.” But to Brown, Buckley looked exhausted at this point. “I heard someone say ‘It’s great to have you back,’ and he said, ‘I haven’t been home since last time I was here.’” After Buckley died, he says, “It was so painful that I don’t think I could listen to him for a long time without that sadness that came with it. I just couldn’t believe it. It was such a tragic, silly way to die, and I wish we were talking about his fifth album, not his first one. He was a phenomenal artist.” It is the younger music fans who come through Brown’s shop who are the acid test of Grace’s longevity. “We’re all jaded old men, but then 20-year-olds come in and go, ‘What the fuck is this?!’ That’s a sign of good music. Grace is a record that just never stops selling. We would sell a copy of that record every single day.” Really, though. You had to be there.

24) Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 6: Leicester — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     Guardian writers’ predicted position: 12th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s position: 10th Prospects Leicester’s rather muted pre-season got turned upside down with the announcement that the club had parted ways with the manager Amandine Miquel 11 days before the start of their campaign. On the face of it, the decision appears to be harsh on a manager who will feel she was building something after a rollercoaster of a first year. As injury after injury rolled in during the first four months of last season, Miquel cut an increasingly baffled figure at her side’s constant run of bad fortune and her lack of centre-forward options. Jutta Rantala, Lena Petermann and Noémie Mouchon sustained season-ending injuries; Shana Chossenotte was troubled by recurrent injury issues; and Deanne Rose and Hannah Cain continued their recovery from long-term problems. The defensive midfielder Saori Takarada and Ruby Mace were among those given a try-out in the No 9 role as Miquel tried to find a solution. An impressive 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea in December proved a turning point. A strong finish meant Leicester recorded their highest WSL points tally, securing 10th place. They were a team built on solid defensive play, quick transitions and a strong trust in young players – a hallmark of Miquel’s style – and the foundations looked to have been laid for the coming campaign. There has been player turnover this summer and recruitment has been a challenge. Seven players have left, leading to a loss of experience. Petermann, Takarada and CJ Bott returned home and the departures of the ever-present Sophie Howard to FC Como and Yuka Momiki to Everton will have been a blow. Only three players have come through the door. The 18-year-old goalkeeper Katie Keane is one of the Republic of Ireland’s brightest young talents and made the move from Shamrock Rovers. The experienced midfielder Celeste Boureille arrived from Montpellier and Heather Payne also signed. Leicester’s problems could mount rapidly given their tough start. They face Manchester United and Chelsea in the first three games, a challenge that has become more difficult in recent days. The manager The rumour mill is circling around who Miquel’s replacement could be, with Matt Beard a strong contender after his shock departure from Burnley. As it stands the team are manager-less at a time when several key rivals are recruiting significantly. Whoever comes in will have their work cut out and will need to get a young team up to scratch very quickly to avoid a washout. Off-field picture The appointment of Lee Billiard as director of women’s and girls’ football was regarded as a coup after his four-year spell at Aston Villa as Leicester look to build for success on the pitch and commercially. Now without a manager and assistant manager – Amaury Messuwe also departed – he will be busy as the season approaches, with the squad also needing to be bolstered. Will the decision to remove Miquel prove to be the making or breaking of his tenure at the club? Star signing In a relatively quiet summer to date, Payne has been the signing that has caught the eye. The Republic of Ireland international arrived after two years at Everton and getting over recent injury struggles. A versatile wide player, the 25-year-old has the attacking attributes to thrive as a winger but can equally be used as a full-back or wing-back. With more than 50 caps, she adds to Leicester’s growing international contingent and played a significant role in Ireland’s inaugural World Cup appearance in 2023. Stepping up: The 17-year-old Nelly Las has had a year to remember for club and country and signed a new contract this summer. Her transition from Leicester’s academy, which she joined at the age of nine, to the senior setup has appeared seamless.

25) Police warn protesters not to travel to Epping after asylum hotel ruling – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     The Home Office won its appeal against the closure of the Bell hotel in Epping for asylum seekers. This means asylum seekers will stay in the lodgings in Essex past 12 September. In its successful appeal, the Home Office argued removing the men could damage the asylum accommodation system but the government said it still plans to stop using the hotels by the end of this parliament. The council could still be granted another injunction at the full hearing in mid-October. Epping Forest District council has said “this is not the end of the matter” and they will “continue to fight”. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch responded to the court decision by saying Keir Starmer “puts the rights of illegal immigrants above British people”, while shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said there is “no acceptable accommodation for illegal migrants”. In nearby Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a video posted on YouTube showed dozens of demonstrators behind barriers near the Delta Marriott hotel, which has also been used to house asylum seekers. Essex police said it was putting a section 60AA order in place in Epping, which gives police the power to ask anyone to remove an item such as a mask that is being used to conceal identity. The order will be in place for 24 hours, the force said. In a post on Facebook, Essex police said: “Throughout the evening, we have monitored a protest in Cheshunt and we now believe a group of people present there are planning to travel to Epping. A number of people involved in that group have been seen wearing facemasks and balaclavas.” Deputy PM Angela Rayner should face an ethics inquiry over her tax affairs, the Conservatives said. The Telegraph newspaper claimed Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, saved £40,000 in stamp duty on a second home she bought in Hove for £800,000. This was because she removed her name from the deed to a family property in Greater Manchester, the newspaper reported. However, Rayner also previously suggested the Greater Manchester home remained her primary residence, according to the Telegraph, saving some £2,000 in council tax on her grace and favour home in central London at Admiralty House. The Conservatives have referred Rayner to the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests as a result of the conflicting reports. The Tories have also written to Tameside council, the authority that covers her Greater Manchester home, asking the authority to strike her from the electoral register if the property is no longer her primary residence. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said Rayner “has followed advice on the allocation of her official residence at all times”. A statement provided by the deputy prime minister’s team to the Telegraph said: “The deputy prime minister paid the relevant duty owing on the purchase of the Hove property in line with relevant requirements and entirely properly. “Any suggestion otherwise is entirely without basis.” Essex police said it was putting a section 60AA order in place in Epping, which gives police the power to ask anyone to remove an item such as a mask that is being used to conceal identity. The order will be in place for 24 hours, the force said. In a post on Facebook, Essex police said: “Throughout the evening, we have monitored a protest in Cheshunt and we now believe a group of people present there are planning to travel to Epping. “A number of people involved in that group have been seen wearing facemasks and balaclavas.” Assistant chief constable Glen Pavelin said: “We will always seek to facilitate peaceful protest, for all groups. “But the threat of antisocial behaviour and criminality by people attempting to conceal their identity steps outside of the reasonableness of protest, and we have a duty to protect our community. “My officers will be fair and engaging, but they will be firm in how they deal with anyone who is asked to remove a face covering and refuses. “Anyone who does not will face arrest.” In nearby Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a video posted on YouTube showed dozens of demonstrators behind barriers near the Delta Marriott hotel, which has also been used to house asylum seekers. Police stood in front of the barriers and some roads were closed with counter-protesters from Stand Up To Racism also in attendance. At one point, protesters appeared to clash with officers. Away from the ruling for a moment, suspended Labour MSP Colin Smyth has denied allegations that he placed a secret camera in toilets inside the Scottish Parliament. The Press Association understands that Smyth has been charged by the police in relation to the allegation, which was first reported in the Daily Record. The South Scotland MSP was arrested on 5 August and charged with a separate offence of possession of indecent images, prompting his suspension from Scottish Labour. His Holyrood pass was deactivated on Thursday. On Friday, Smyth said he was “fully co-operating” with the investigation but said the decision by the police to release further information and his home address had been “devastating”. He said: This allegation has come as an utter shock and one I strongly refute. For legal reasons, I can’t respond to specific matters or speculation, and I appreciate there is a process to go through which I am, of course, fully co-operating with. But I sincerely hope it can be concluded quickly and fairly. The speculation, and the recent decision by the police to publicly release details of their ongoing inquiries along with my home address has been devastating and has taken a serious toll on my health. After my address was published with no warning to my family, I felt I had no choice but to move away to protect them. That has also meant losing the local NHS critical support I had been receiving for the past few weeks, making an already difficult time even more distressing. I would therefore ask that the privacy of myself, but above all my family and friends, is respected while this matter is resolved. Having this hanging over them is especially overwhelming. Responding to the ruling, Steve Smith, chief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais, told the BBC it “made it clear that violent protest, and in many cases overt racism, is not a fast-track route for the far right to attack the rights of people seeking sanctuary in this country”. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Lisa Smart, told the broadcaster that Labour should be “speeding up asylum processing to bring down the backlog and end hotel use once and for all”. And border security and asylum minister Dame Angela Eagle said the government “will stop using hotels, which aren’t a sustainable solution, by the end of this parliament”. “This judgement assists us by allowing us to do that in a planned and orderly fashion,” she said. “We all want the same thing,” she added, “which is to get out of asylum hotels”. Protesters were already gathering outside the Bell hotel by Friday evening with St George and union flags waving. This court ruling was never going to end as a quiet legal moment. For the Home Office, the court of appeal’s decision was a practical win. If the ruling had gone the other way the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils. Since there is scant alternative accommodation available, this ruling buys the government time. Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year. If the closures proceed, the ruling means they still have time to deliver their promise of shutting all the hotels down “in a controlled and orderly way” by 2029. But political tensions have, of course, been reignited. Nigel Farage immediately jumped on the moment, accusing the government of “using the law against the people of Epping”. He said “illegal migrants now have more rights than the people of Essex” and promised Reform UK would “put an end to this”. This is the kind of high-emotion, high-visibility moment Farage thrives on and a story that plays into his hands. Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, also piled in, telling supporters on X: “Judges side with illegal migrants against British people. ECHR used by judges to overrule planning law, democratic protests and the safety of Epping residents.” The government remains stuck in the same political fight – trying to stave off challenges from the right while at the same time getting on with the job of ensuring there is a functioning political project that can communicate its wins. Angela Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said: “Nobody wants to close the Bell hotel and all other asylum hotels more than me.” She reiterated the government’s pledge to do this by 2029. Asked what her message is for those who say the fight’s not over, she responded: “I think we all want the same thing – which is to get out of asylum hotels.” Eagle added: “We’ve said they’re not sustainable and we’ve inherited a system with huge backlogs,” the BBC reported. A temporary injunction that would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, has been overturned by the court of appeal. Here we explain what the court decided, and its significance, writes Haroon Siddique and Aletha Adu. What was the appeal about? Last week, after an application by Epping Forest district council (EFDC), a high court judge ruled that asylum seekers could no longer be placed at the protest-hit Bell hotel and gave its owner, Somani Hotels, until 12 September to rehouse the 138 remaining there. Mr Justice Eyre granted the injunction, to remain in force until the case could be heard in full in October, after hearing EFDC’s complaints that planning law had been breached in changing the site’s use. Somani Hotels challenged the decision at the court of appeal, as did the Home Office, which had been refused permission by Eyre to intervene in the high court case. What did the court of appeal decide and why? The three justices said both Somani Hotels and the Home Office, which it permitted to intervene in the case, could appeal against Eyre’s decision and quashed the temporary injunction in the meantime. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said Eyre had made a number of errors in principle. He said: “The judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system.” A protester outside the Bell Hotel in Epping said the Court of Appeal ruling was “devastating” and could “cause civil unrest”. Carmen, who wore a pink top that said “Pink Ladies Say, The Only Way is Epping, Send Them Home” on it, said she was “very let down” by the ruling. Speaking outside the Bell Hotel, the Epping resident told the PA news agency: “We come every week – march, protest – and today’s ruling is just devastating, absolutely devastating. It will probably cause civil unrest. “It’s shocking, it’s like they’ve won. The schools go back next week – the kids will be walking around the back, it’s not good.” Asked why she was protesting outside the hotel, Carmen said: “To show our support – get them out. “We’re not racist, and I’m all for things done legally, but these are unvetted 18-30s, maybe some plus. “We don’t know who they are, we don’t know what they’ve done, but now they’re letting us know what they’re like.” An Epping councillor said the Court of Appeal ruling was “hurtful” and claims children are “frightened to go to school” in the town. Shane Yerrell, who represents Waltham Abbey West for Epping Forest District Council, said he was “disgusted” by the Court of Appeal’s ruling. Speaking outside the Bell Hotel, Yerrell told the PA news agency: “All the local parents felt like there was one big step forward when the High Court agreed to close the hotel and things started to calm down. “But then for the Home Office and the Government to both appeal and that be accepted today is hurtful.” In a further statement following the Court of Appeal ruling, Epping Forest District Council said it was “ruling nothing out”, including taking its bid for a temporary injunction to the Supreme Court. It said: “We do not accept the criticisms of the council which has acted only in the interests of the people of Epping Forest. We are reviewing our position – we are ruling nothing out until we have examined all the options up to and including the Supreme Court. “Epping Forest District Council has responded to criticism related to earlier use of the Bell Hotel despite this not being relevant to the current legal action. “The circumstances of the placement in 2023 were very different to those in 2025. In reality the complexity of some planning applications mean that they take much longer than the statutory eight weeks to determine.” The council added: “In any case it would not have affected the outcome of the application. At any time after the eight-week period, the hotel operator could have appealed against non-determination. “In the event, the Home Office ceased the use of the Bell as asylum seeker accommodation and it became an academic point. “To have continued once the use had ceased would seem to have been a waste of taxpayers’ money, especially as we had no reason to believe the Bell would be stood up again.” Shadow home secretary Chris Philp claimed the Epping hotel case had “seen the Labour government using the courts against the British public”. He said: The government even brazenly said in court that the rights of illegal immigrants were more important than the rights of local people. The numbers in asylum hotels were dropping fast before the election – but have risen since because Labour has lost control of our borders. We need a proper deterrent so that all illegal immigrants are immediately removed on arrival. Then no one would bother crossing in the first place. We had a plan to do this – the Rwanda plan – but Labour scrapped it just before it was due to start. As a result, numbers crossing the channel are now the worst ever. We have a full-blown border crisis and public-safety crisis – but this government is too weak to take the action needed to fix it. The full written ruling overturning the temporary injunction which would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel will be handed down remotely on Monday at 4pm, according to court listings. Before reading a summary of their judgment on Friday, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said their full judgment, running to more than 120 paragraphs, would be handed down later. The leader of Epping Forest District Council in Essex has questioned whether Bell Hotel owners Somani Hotels “chased” its planning application. In a summary of their ruling, Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb highlighted that in February 2023 Somani had sought planning permission from the council to temporarily change the hotel’s use to accommodate asylum seekers rather than paying members of the public, but that the council “did not process the application” for more than a year. Asked why the application had taken so long to process, councillor Christopher Whitbread said he was “not close enough to the detail” to give a “full answer”. He added: “I think, you know, you have to ask yourself ‘was the company chasing the planning application during that time?’ “In my knowledge of planning applications, if they’ve been delayed, that the company going for the planning application will be chasing the council. “Did they chase the council? We don’t know.” The government has “let the residents of Epping down”, the leader of Epping Forest District Council said. Asked what his message would be to people who may be planning to protest this weekend in the Essex town, Councillor Christopher Whitbread told the PA news agency: “We don’t want to see some violent scenes around the hotel or in the town itself that would that would only help the Government’s arguments, and it’s the Government that have let the residents of Epping down. “I had numerous conversations with various people around this issue, the Home Office were not helpful.” He said housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel was “not right” for residents of Epping or those living in the hotel itself, adding: “We made that argument to the previous government and eventually they closed it. “This Government reopened it in April with no real consultation with us, they instructed us that they were going to use it. “We were instructed on the numbers and such that they were prepared to use it up to, and really they have let down completely the residents of Epping Forest, and I think what underlined it was their legal argument yesterday around the ECHR and the fact that the asylum seekers trump the residents of Epping when it comes to their rights.” In reaction to today’s verdict, Weyman Bennett, Stand Up to Racism co-convenor said: “The initial judgement was always wrong. It was a concession to racist thugs set on scapegoating and intimidating refugees.” Kevin Courtney, Stand Up To Racism co-chair, said: “This court judgement is welcome, hateful demonstrations should not determine public policy. “The far right will seek to use it to stimulate more and more hostile demonstrations targeting asylum seeker in hotels. It’s important that all people of goodwill speak out and peacefully mobilise against this hateful targeting of vulnerable people.” Protesters have begun to gather outside the Bell Hotel in Epping after the Court of Appeal ruling. A small number of demonstrators carrying England and Union flags have gathered outside the hotel, with police officers guarding its entrance – which is gated off with metal fencing. An England flag has been attached to a drain pipe on the side of the Bell Hotel and England flags have also been painted onto signs and a speed camera outside the hotel. Three appeal judges on Friday set aside a temporary injunction granted to Epping Forest district council last week, saying the decision to allow it was “seriously flawed” and contained several “errors in principle”. The hotel has in recent weeks become the focus of repeated protests – some of which have been orchestrated by far-right extremists and have turned violent. Epping council had offered this as part of its grounds for seeking the injunction – alongside concerns about planning permission for the hotel. Last week, Mr Justice Eyre, sitting in the high court, agreed. But, on Friday, the court of appeal judges said upholding that order could lead to further disorder by effectively demonstrating it could achieve its ultimate goal – the removal of the asylum seekers one way or another. They said the people living at the Bell hotel would have to be housed somewhere, while other councils could take preserving the injunction as a green light to seek the same in their areas. In a summary of their ruling, Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb said that Somani Hotels, which owns the Bell hotel, was first made aware of legal action being taken by Epping Forest district council when it “received the court papers and a court bundle running to over 1,600 pages”. The judges said the authority’s “tactics” were “procedurally unfair” and “ought to have reinforced the argument” that a temporary injunction should not have been issued. They said: For much of the period of four years from 2020-2024, Somani [Hotels] had been running the hotel as accommodation for asylum seekers without enforcement action from the council. When, in 2023, Somani [Hotels] sought planning consent to change its use, for over a year, Epping did not process the application, notwithstanding the statutory duty upon it to do so within eight weeks. The council was aware by February 2025 that the hotel was once again to be used to house asylum seekers and by its letter of 15 May 2025, Somani [Hotels] made clear that it had been advised by the Home Office that a planning application was unnecessary. The council took no steps in response to this letter, whether by issuing an enforcement notice or otherwise. There was no threat of court proceedings. Epping Forest district council will “continue to fight” the government after the court of appeal ruling, a councillor has said. Holly Whitbread said the ruling was “deeply disappointing”, adding she felt “utterly let down and betrayed by the government”. Whitbread, who is finance and economic development portfolio holder for Epping Forest district council, told the PA news agency: The council will continue to fight this We’re looking at our legal options now and we will be going ahead, I presume, with the permanent injunction in the October trial, if that’s still possible. The Conservative councillor added: The council has always been against the use of this hotel in this location. One of the key points that wasn’t made clear in the court case was the change to all-male asylum seekers within the hotel. I’m pretty furious at the government’s action to intervene in what was a legal planning matter. And I think this news will be deeply disappointing to the residents of Epping Forest and, more broadly, across the UK as well. In a summary of their ruling overturning the injunction related to the Bell hotel, Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb said an argument put forward by the Home Office in the appeal about a “hierarchy of rights” was “unattractive”. The Home Office had told the court of appeal in written submissions for Thursday’s hearing that while Epping Forest district council represented “the public interest that subsists in planning control in its local area”, the department represented the “public interest of the entirety of the United Kingdom”. Barristers for the government told the court that the European convention on human rights “establishes non-derogable fundamental human rights”, adding: The respective legal rights in play are fundamentally different in nature. In a summary of their ruling, the three court of appeal judges said: The written arguments on behalf of [the Home Office] in this appeal included the contention that ‘the relevant public interests in play are not equal’ and that one aspect of this is that the home secretary’s statutory duty is a manifestation of the UK’s obligations under article 3 of the European convention on human rights. This point was not pursued in oral argument. Any argument in this particular context about a hierarchy of rights is in our view unattractive. The summary continued: We were told by counsel for Epping [Forest district council] that the protests operated as a ‘trigger’ for the application for the injunction. The fact of protests outside a building is not obviously a matter falling within planning control. While we accept that the judge was right to exercise considerable caution before attaching weight to the fact of the protests, including unlawful protests outside the hotel, he nonetheless gave weight in his evaluation to the fact that protests were occurring and weighed them in the balance as a factor in favour of granting the injunction. These are worrying aspects of the judgment. If an outbreak of protests enhances the case for a planning injunction, this runs the risk of acting as an impetus or incentive for further protests, some of which may be disorderly, around asylum accommodation. At its worst, if even unlawful protests are to be treated as relevant, there is a risk of encouraging further lawlessness. The judge does not appear to have considered this risk, again perhaps because he had denied himself the advantage of hearing submissions on the merits from counsel for the [Home Office]. Further and in any event, in this regard the judge failed to consider whether there would have been alternative measures to mitigate the disruption, such as the use of police powers. Nigel Farage claimed the European convention on human rights had been “used” by the government “against the people of Epping”, though the judge ruled that arguments about a “hierarchy of rights” were “unattractive”. The Reform UK leader said: The government has used ECHR against the people of Epping. Illegal migrants have more rights than the British people under Starmer. He did not specify which part of the case he was referring to. The Home Office’s lawyers had argued “the relevant public interests in play are not equal”, referring to Epping’s interest in enforcing planning control on the one hand, and the home secretary’s duty which comes from UK obligations under the ECHR on the other. However, Friday’s ruling says: Any argument in this particular context about a hierarchy of rights is in our view unattractive. For more on this topic, read BBC News home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani’s take on the ruling (see 3.29pm BST). The leader of Epping Forest district council has called for calm after the court of appeal ruled asylum seekers can stay at the Bell hotel in Essex. Councillor Chris Whitbread told Times Radio: I call for calm. There’s been peaceful protests and there’s been non peaceful protests outside the hotel. He added: We saw yesterday the government say that asylum seekers have more rights than my residents. I’m really cross with this ruling. Obviously we’ll now reflect on where we are. Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful, but we will do everything we can still. This is an awful position for the town … I’m really concerned for the future of the town at the moment. Speaking outside the London court after the ruling, Ken Williamson, member of cabinet for Epping Forest district council said: We understand government faces a dilemma, but that should not be at the expense of local communities. Planning law may seem dull, it might seem boring, but it goes to the heart of the relationship between local communities and good government. It enshrines the rights of local people to have a say within their own communities, and it should not be set aside lightly. The government can still listen. It needs to understand and take responsibility for the events that have taken place in Epping over the past six weeks, for the trauma and disruption brought upon our community. The council could still be granted an injunction after a full hearing of the legal claim, which is due to be heard in October. Reacting to the overturning of the injunction, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said while the government was successful in its appeal, the reality of using hotels to house asylum seekers is “untenable”. He said: Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an option. As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and persecution feeling unsafe. Through our frontline work we see how refugees housed in neighbourhoods, rather than isolated in hotels, are able to rebuild their lives, enter training or work, and contribute to the local economy. The refugee charity urged ministers to adopt a “one off” scheme granting temporary permission to stay to asylum seekers from countries most likely to be recognised as refugees as a way to close hotels by next year, according to its own analysis. Speaking on BBC News, the broadcaster’s home and legal correspondent, Dominic Casciani, said from outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the judgment: To use an analogy from sport, it felt like a wrestling smackdown for the judge who gave this injunction to the council. This is quite a technical thing because in essence the lower court, the high court, the judge there had the discretion to say: ‘Look, I’ve looked at all the facts and using my discretion, which is why I think an injunction is necessary because the facts on the ground are such that we’ve got a really concerning situation. We’ve got to contain what’s going on there, therefore I think it’s in the best interest to move the asylum seekers out for the time being before Epping Forest district council gets to mount its full case against the hotel owner, which will then ultimately decide the issue one way or another.’ What the court of appeal said today was: ‘No, you got that completley wrong. And the reason you got that completely wrong is because you failed to take into account that there are compelling arguments that the home secretary has to be allowed to make, because she is under a legal duty, imposed by parliament.’ [And] this is the important thing, it’s imposed by parliament, it’s got nothing to do with the European court of human rights or all that stuff you might read elsewhere, this is a duty imposed by parliament to make sure that asylum seekers aren’t sleeping on the streets. So, every day that the home secretary is not finding somewhere to put somebody in a bed, she’s facing potential legal action over that failure to do so. And what the court of appeal said was that the judge who issued the injuction should have taken all of this in to account before issuing his orders to clear the hotel, because how could he otherwise have understood the implications for national policy and effectively what is known as the wider public interest. … the strength of the argument from the court of appeal … in essence, the practical effects of that are that I think this makes it exceptionally hard for any other council to try and do what Epping Forest [council] have done. The Home Office has issued a ministerial statement regarding today’s court of appeal judgment on the use of the Bell hotel. Angela Eagle, minister for border security and asylum said: We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day. The number of hotels has almost halved since its peak in 2023 and we have brought down costs by 15% saving £700m and putting us on track to save a billion pounds a year by 2028-29. We are also working hard to relieve pressure on the system and striking back at criminal people smuggling gangs at every stage, including returning more than 35,000 people who have no right to be here, equipping law enforcement with counter-terror style powers and starting to detain small boat arrivals under our groundbreaking deal with France. It will take some time to fix the broken system we inherited, but the British public deserve nothing less, and we will not stop until the job is done. Senior Tory Robert Jenrick called the court of appeal ruling “extremely disappointing” and urged councils to still take action to close asylum hotels in their areas. Shadow justice secretary Jenrick posted on X: This is an extremely disappointing decision. Yvette Cooper used taxpayer money – your money – to keep open a hotel housing illegal migrants. The government’s lawyers argued accommodating illegal migrants was in the ‘national interest’. In court they said the right of illegal migrants to free hotels is more important than the rights of the British people. Well, they are not. The British government should always put the interests of the British people first. Starmer’s government has shown itself to be on the side of illegal migrants who have broken into our county. But this is not a free pass for asylum hotels. Councils can and should still act to close hotels. If they don’t, residents will rightly ask, on whose side are they? My team and LawForBorders will continue to provide legal assistance to help protect communities. There is no acceptable accommodation for illegal migrants. The government should be prioritising Brits in need and deporting every illegal migrant, as the last government should have done and I’ve argued for years. Senior Conservative James Cleverly suggested that the Home Office was cutting local people out of the loop. The shadow local government secretary said: I’m sure that Yvette Cooper and the Home Office officials think this is good news. It really isn’t. Cutting local people and their elected representatives out of the loop isn’t a good look. After the court of appeal’s ruling, Lisa Foster of Richard Buxton Solicitors, which represents Somani Hotels, said: We are pleased that the court of appeal has ruled that the injunction should not have been granted by the high court. Our clients realise that they have been caught in the middle of a much wider debate on the treatment of asylum seekers and respectfully ask that members of the public understand that the Bell hotel has simply been providing a contracted service that the government requires. We now ask that all associated with the Bell hotel are left alone to continue to support the government’s asylum plans as best they can. We are grateful to the court of appeal for appreciating the urgency of the matter from everyone’s point of view and dealing with the matter so swiftly. We have no further comment and will not be commenting on the matter again. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed Keir Starmer “puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities”. She urged Conservative councillors seeking similar injunctions to “KEEP GOING!” despite the ruling. In a statement, Badenoch said: Local communities should not pay the price for Labour’s total failure on illegal immigration. Keir Starmer has shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities. This ruling is a setback, but it is not the end. I say to Conservative councils seeking similar injunctions against asylum hotels – KEEP GOING! Every case has different circumstances, and I know good Conservative councils will keep fighting for residents, so we will keep working with them every step of the way. She said the party will be writing to all Tory councillors with further advice after the judgment. Badenoch added: Labour have run out of options, so the only answer left is to dump the problem on local communities. Reading the summary, Lord Justice Bean said: The Epping residents’ fear of crime was properly taken into account by the judge as a factor in favour of grant of an injunction. He described it as being of limited weight. He added: We agree it is relevant, but in our view, it is clearly outweighed … by the undesirability of incentivising protests, by the desirability in the interests of justice of preserving status quo for the relatively brief period leading up to the forthcoming trial and by the range of public interest factors which we have discussed in our judgment. A temporary injunction that would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, has been overturned at the court of appeal. Quashing the injunction, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said: We grant permission to appeal, both to Somani and to [the Home Office]. He continued: We allow the appeals and we set aside the injunction imposed on 19 August 2025. Giving a summary of their ruling, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said: We conclude that the judge made a number of errors in principle, which undermine this decision. He continued: The judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system. He added that such an injunction “may incentivise” other councils to take similar steps as Epping Forest district council. He said: The potential cumulative impact of such ad-hoc applications was a material consideration … that was not considered by the judge. Three senior judges have ruled that the Home Office can intervene in the case related to a temporary injunction concerning the Bell hotel in Epping. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said that Mr Justice Eyre made an “erroneous” decision not to let the department be involved. Reading a summary of their decision, Bean said the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public safety” and was affected by the issues. Reading a summary of the ruling, Lord Justice Bean said: We should say at the outset what this appeal is not about. It is not concerned with the merits of government policy in relation to the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers in hotels or otherwise. Lord Justice Bean is reading a summary of the panel’s judgment. He’s just outlined the two linked applications for permission to appeal, one from the Home Office and home secretary and the other by Somani Hotels, which owns the Bell hotel. He has also spoken about how many asylum seekers the hotel houses and Epping Forest district council’s (EFDC) argument that Somani Hotel’s actions are in breach of planning law. Three senior judges have begun giving their judgment on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is set to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, is reading a summary of their decision at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. We’re expecting the judgment from the court of appeal shortly on whether to overturn a temporary injunction to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. In the meantime, here’s the Guardian’s report on the hearing that took place yesterday: The government failed to analyse the costs involved in the largest reorganisation of English councils in decades, BBC News reports. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner claimed that merging councils in 21 areas into single authorities could save “a significant amount of money.” But cost estimates from Rayner’s housing department were based on a 2020 report commissioned by the County Councils Network (CCN), which projected potential savings of £2.9bn over a five-years period. Since then, the CCN has updated its findings and now suggests that the reorganisation might not lead to any savings and could, in some cases, result in higher costs. Tim Oliver, chairman of the CCN, said reorganisation could still deliver “billions in efficiency savings to be reinvested in frontline services,” but only if implemented at the right scale. Oliver added: We are concerned over the potential costs of reorganisation where proposals seek to replace the two-tier system with multiple small unitary councils. In the current two-tier system, responsibilities are shared between county councils and district councils. Local councils involved in the restructuring have been submitting proposals to form new single-tier authorities. David Lammy was given more than £32,000 worth of luxury gifts from the crown prince of Kuwait after visiting the country last month but is not keeping the offerings due to UK government rules, PA reports. The foreign secretary received a Chopard watch and pen set worth £11,002, a Cartier pen worth £435, FRED jewellery worth £18,250 and perfume worth £2,500 by Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah, newly released data shows. All the gifts, given in July, will be held by the Foreign Office. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has not kept a special edition whisky he was given by Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort, which was above the value limit for gifts that can be accepted by members of government without being declared. A book and a tie he received from French president Emmanuel Macron, and a leather wallet received by Victoria Starmer from Brigitte Macron, have also been held by No 10 rather than purchased. Ministers can keep gifts worth up to £140 and do not have to declare them but if the gift is of higher value, they can choose to pay the difference between the value and £140 to buy it, or to leave it with their department. Meanwhile, the Green party in England and Wales has confirmed it will announce the result of its leadership election on Tuesday (2 September). Two weeks ago, we reported that Zack Polanski, the insurgent candidate whose “eco-populism” and social media savvy have upended the race, had started to pull away from his more-established rivals. There is a growing expectation that the election will be won by the 42-year-old former Liberal Democrat, who appears to have seized the initiative from his opponents. One likened it to a “hostile takeover”. The comment relates to an apparent influx of new left-leaning members in local areas, attracted by his modern communications method and more pugnacious style. It has left his nearest opponents, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, struggling to gain traction despite their head start in terms of profile within the party. The full timetable for its internal elections can be viewed here. The new leaders of the Scottish Greens, Ross Greer and Gillian Mackay, have promised to campaign for a universal income, free bus travel and higher taxation on the rich after winning a muted election contest. Greer and Mackay, who were both backbench MSPs at Holyrood, were appointed co-conveners of the Scottish Greens after a noticeably low turnout of 12.7% – only 950 of the party’s 7,500 members voted after a low-key summer campaign. They admitted the turnout was worrying. Greer said he had long believed the party had lost its energy and significant changes to its structures, internal elections and campaign apparatus were needed. “We’ve allowed ourselves to become a radical bureaucracy rather than a radical democracy,” he said. “And we need to see serious internal reform. We need to reform as a party if we are to grow as a party.” Mackay denied it was embarrassing. “I think it is a concern. And I think that’s why we do need to find out why [turnout was so low],” she said. The leadership contest took on added significance as it was called after Patrick Harvie, who had been the UK’s longest-serving party leader, announced earlier this year he was standing down after 17 years in the post due to ill health. Scott McDonald, the chief executive of the British Council, has written an opinion piece for the Guardian: On Wednesday night, our office in Kyiv was damaged in a Russian missile attack. It was a stark reminder of the risks that an organisation such as ours faces in conflict-affected areas. I was relieved to hear that all colleagues were safe and accounted for. One colleague was injured and admitted to hospital but thankfully he is in a stable condition. Working under such conditions around the world is challenging, and yet, time and again, our colleagues and partners demonstrate courage and commitment in carrying on despite the dangers. Their resilience is extraordinary. We are working to find ways to minimise disruption and continuing to support our team there. Persistent air alerts mean some of our colleagues are required to remain in shelters, but sadly this is nothing new. The war has taken an enormous toll on the Ukrainian population, including a deterioration in quality of life, severe psychological and emotional challenges, and the disruption of social connections and education. But the unyielding spirit of the people is always evident. Take, for instance, a British Council event that took place in September last year, when we set up a pop-up event in Lviv in partnership with Molodvizh, the city’s largest youth event. Tragically, during a missile attack a few hours before the event, a representative of a partner organisation was killed, along with her family. This greatly affected everyone, but it was felt by all the partners that it was important the event should continue. Despite these perilous circumstances, British Council colleagues and partner organisations continue our work with education, teaching, English language learning and cultural programmes right across Ukraine, as we have done for the past 30 years. When a country is at war the protection of its culture is ever more important, and the British Council is a key partner in supporting Ukraine.

My colleagues, Nicola Davis and Jamie Grierson explore the background to the rollout in this explainer: Three senior judges will rule on whether to overturn a temporary injunction to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, at 2pm on Friday. The Home Office and Somani Hotels, which owns the site, are attempting to challenge a high court judge’s decision last week to issue an interim injunction to Epping Forest district council that will stop dozens of asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel beyond 12 September. The government is also seeking to appeal against Justice Eyre’s decision not to allow it to intervene in the case, while the council opposes the appeal bids, the PA news agency reports. At the end of a hearing on Thursday, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said that they would hand down their judgment on Friday afternoon. He said: Because of the great urgency of this matter, we will aim to give judgment at 2pm tomorrow. If it proves impractical for us to meet the deadline, we will let people know in advance. Speaking after the Scottish Green party leader election results were announced in Edinburgh on Friday, newly elected co-leader Gillian Mackay said “today marks a generational shift in the leadership of the Scottish Greens”. She vowed she and Ross Greer – also a newly elected co-leader – will “lead with courage and listen with intent”, putting party members “at the heart of our movement”. Greer said he is “excited to be embarking on this journey as co-leader” with his “friend” Mackay, reports the PA news agency. Mackay won 34% of first preference votes, and was elected at stage one of the ballot. Greer gained 31% of first preference votes, ahead of Lorna Slater on 28% and Dominic Ashmole, who polled 7%. Greer was elected at the third stage of the ballot, with 33.4% of votes, ahead of Slater, who had 32%. Greer said after the results were announced: Gillian and I have known each other for a long time, we have spent a long time talking about what we would do if we were ever in charge of this party. Now we get to stress-test all of those theories about what a Scottish Green party led by us would actually look like. He insisted the Scottish Greens are “the only genuinely progressive party left in this country” in the run-up to next May’s Holyrood election. He claimed the SNP is “dropping progressive policies all over the place”, while Labour is “aping every Nigel Farage press release”. Greer said the Greens are “brave enough to take on the rich and powerful”, and he told party members: Now is the time for us to do difficult things. We know our party can do better, can be better. We need to continue on that journey of improvement, we need to get better with our messaging, better with our campaigns. We need to make it fun. We are trying to transform Scotland for the better, that should be a joyful experience for everyone who wants to get involved in. Mackay meanwhile said Green policies, such as free bus travel for under-22s and the introduction of buffer zones around abortion clinics – legislation she herself successfully brought forward at Holyrood – mean the party has “already started improving the lives of millions”. But she insisted: “We can and will go further.” Mackay, who had her first baby over the summer recess, said she will “champion a four-day week, better parental pay and basic universal income” – adding these are “policies that will transform lives”. Both new co-leaders praised their predecessors, with Mackay saying: I want to thank Patrick for the work he has done for the party in the past 17 years. I have never known a Scottish Greens without him at the helm, and I certainly think it is going to be an adjustment for us all. Greer said: Patrick has defined our party in the eyes of the Scottish public for almost two decades, he has led us through periods of incredible growth and achievement. He thanked Patrick Harvie for “transforming this party from a well-meaning, enthusiastic fringe outfit into a force capable of delivering the transformation people and planet really need here in Scotland”. He also thanked Slater for “six years of incredible service as co-leader of our party”. Government silence and a light news agenda has created the conditions for a seemingly well-funded Nigel Farage barrage, writes the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot. You can read her analysis on Farage season and how, with its rivals away, Reform has been basking in summer headlines: Bunting has been removed by a council from across a road due to concerns that a high-sided vehicle could drive into it and pull down the poles holding it up, reports the PA news agency. Durham county council has issued a statement about the recent increase in the number of union flags and Saint George’s cross displays on lamp-posts. The Reform-led council said that while it understood and respected people’s desire to display national pride, public safety should not be compromised. It will take a “risk-based approach” and it will remove flags where they pose a danger to road users, obstruct visibility for drivers or pedestrians, or if they are poorly secured. The statement published on Friday continued: Yesterday we were left with no choice but to remove bunting across a road at New Brancepeth, following a risk assessment. The rope involved was so strong that, had a high-sided vehicle driven into it, the poles it was attached to could have been pulled down. Our approach reflects our commitment to balancing community expression with public safety, practical resource management, and proportionality in our operations. According to the PA news agency, the council also warned the public of the risk of attaching flags to lighting columns, saying that leaning ladders against them “imposes additional loads beyond their designed capacity”. The council said: The weight of a person climbing or working on a column can lead to structural failure, endangering both the installer and the public. UK bank shares tumbled on Friday, cutting the stock market value of the sector by almost £8bn in morning trading, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the autumn budget spooked investors. Calls for a tax grab, in a paper written by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank, took a toll on some of the UK’s biggest high street banks. NatWest Group suffered the biggest drop on Friday morning, registering a decline of as much as 5% in its share price, while Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays followed close behind, falling 4.5% and 3.6% respectively. HSBC dropped more than 1%. The falls cut the notional value of the UK’s biggest banks by £7.9bn within hours of the market opening. It comes as rumours swirl over a number of potential tax increases – including on banks, property and landlords’ rental income – which could help the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, plug a shortfall of up to £40bn in the public finances. The IPPR’s report calls for a new tax on the big banks that would help to recover “windfalls” enjoyed by lenders as a result of an emergency economic policy known as quantitative easing, which was put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Confidence among UK businesses has grown despite anxiety about the state of the economy, in a rare slice of positive news for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to her autumn budget. An August poll of UK companies by Lloyds Bank showed that improved sentiment among manufacturers and retailers helped push overall optimism within UK plc up by two percentage points, with 54% of companies now feeling confident in the current environment. It marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase in overall business sentiment, according to the Lloyds business barometer, driven by a growing number of businesses – roughly 63% – feeling strong about their own trading prospects. On that measurement alone, confidence reached its highest level since 2014. About half of all businesses now expect to hire more staff in the coming year despite growing costs. The survey found 38% of companies are expecting to have to raise wages by 3% or more, with the vast majority – 83% – saying that higher employment-related costs would have a limited impact on hiring plans. Overall optimism across the private sector comes despite jitters over the state of the economy, with levels of positive sentiment falling for the first time since the drop seen in April, when Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements sparked fears over the future of global trade. Economic confidence fell three points to 44% this month, Lloyds said, although that remained above the longer-term average of 19%. However, the fact that business confidence continues to rise amid the economic gloom will be a rare piece of good news for the chancellor, given fears that a fresh round of tax increases – meant to bolster the public finances – could knock confidence and investment across the private sector as companies try to recoup and offset costs. Reeves is expected to announce a date for her autumn budget within days. Scottish Greens have elected a new co-leadership team, with MSPs Gillian Mackay and Ross Greer voted in to take the party forward. The pair replace Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, both of whom had served as junior ministers in the Scottish government under a powersharing deal with the SNP. Harvie announced earlier this year he was standing down from his co-leadership post. Slater had stood for re-election, but was defeated in the leadership contest, which is held every two years under Scottish Green party rules. The UK government has banned Israeli officials from attending the country’s flagship defence event next month. Israeli industry, including UK subsidiaries of Israeli companies will be able to attend London’s Defence &amp; Security Equipment International (DSEI) show in September but the UK government will not invite representatives of the Israeli government to the major industry event. The move comes as Keir Starmer prepares to recognise a Palestinian state after warning Israel it would do so if the country did not take steps to relieve suffering in Gaza and met other conditions. A UK government spokesperson said: The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong. As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025. There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion as it has done previously at the DSEI. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael, IAI and Uvision, will be able to attend. Conspiracy theorists who spread misinformation must be defeated, a health minister said, as he urged parents to take up the new chickenpox jab. The government has announced a new vaccination programme for chickenpox from January, meaning that GPs will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – the clinical term for chickenpox – as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule. Health minister Stephen Kinnock argued it is “common sense” for parents to vaccinate their children, amid what he described as a rise in “vaccine hesitancy” after the Covid pandemic. Speaking to LBC, Kinnock said: There’s been a 10-year trend in declining take-up of vaccines, and I think obviously the vaccine hesitancy that came after the pandemic has definitely not helped. These conspiracy theorists, who are peddling this nonsense and rubbish, we’ve got to take them on, we’ve got to defeat them in our arguments and drown out the noise that they’re making. The government is working with GPs, schools and public health authorities to create local and national campaigns in an attempt to increase take-up, Kinnock said. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: Most parents probably consider chickenpox to be a common and mild illness, but for some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal. It is excellent news, that from next January, we will be introducing a vaccine to protect against chickenpox into the NHS routine childhood vaccination programme – helping prevent what is for most a nasty illness and for those who develop severe symptoms, it could be a life saver. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, chickenpox causes an estimated £24m in lost income and productivity every year in the UK, with parents forced to take time off work to care for their children. The rollout of the vaccine is also expected to save the NHS £15m a year in costs for treating the illness. Kinnock said: We’re giving parents the power to protect their children from chickenpox and its serious complications, while keeping them in nursery or the classroom where they belong and preventing parents from scrambling for childcare or having to miss work. This vaccine puts children’s health first and gives working families the support they deserve. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the jab on the NHS in November 2023. Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, said: This is a hugely positive moment for families as the NHS gets ready to roll out a vaccine to protect children against chickenpox for the first time, adding to the arsenal of other routine jabs that safeguard against serious illness. We will work with vaccination teams and GP surgeries across the country to roll out the combined MMRV vaccine in the new year, helping to keep children healthy and prevent sickness from these highly contagious viruses. The PA news agency reports that outsourcing company Mitie, which manages the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC), has responded to its earlier news story about the government instructing it to remove certain jobs at an immigration removal centre from a recruitment website (see 9.07am BST). A spokesperson for the company said: As part of our contractual obligations, we employ colleagues to run activities at Heathrow immigration removal centre to support the physical and mental wellbeing of detained individuals. The impact of these services was highlighted in the recent HMIP (HM Inspectorate of Prisons) report into Harmondsworth, which said that these provisions contributed to a greater overall focus on helping individuals to manage the stresses of detention. Last year, the watchdog said the conditions at Harmondsworth were the “worst” in the country, with the chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor describing the “chaos” he discovered there as “truly shocking”. The Scottish Greens will announce the result of its leadership election on Friday. Current co-leader Lorna Slater, MSPs Gillian Mackay and Ross Greer and activist Dominic Ashmole are seeking to form the new co-leadership team, with the result to be announced at an event in Edinburgh. Co-leader Patrick Harvie – who has been one of the party’s leaders since 2008 – announced earlier this year he would stand down from the role but continue to be an MSP. Among the policy pledges outlined by the candidates is universal free bus travel, which was proposed by Greer – who has widely been seen as a contender for the leadership since he was elected to Holyrood at the age of 21. Mackay – who shepherded landmark legislation placing buffer zones outside abortion clinics through Holyrood – said she believed she can “take the party further and deliver great election results”. Slater – one of the two only Green members in the UK to serve as a government minister as a result of the Bute House agreement – said the party went from “being a small but effective party to being a significant force in Scottish politics” as she pledged to go further to “build a fairer, more progressive and greener country”. Ashmole – who has stood for the party at numerous elections but does not hold elected office – said his pitch to members is to put climate change front and centre, urging Scots to “prepare for the worst, strive for the best – and protect what we love”. Whichever pair wins the final ballot, reports the PA news agency, the leadership team will probably be the ones to lead the party into the 2026 Holyrood election with a view to increasing their MSP cohort from the seven won in 2021. The government has instructed a contractor to remove certain jobs at an immigration removal centre from a recruitment website after advertisements for floristry and hairdressing tutors emerged, reports the PA agency. Outsourcing company Mitie, which manages the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC) near the west London airport, listed several roles online including a painting and decorating tutor and gym manager at the IRC for salaries that range between £31,000 and £38,000. One of the job descriptions includes responsibilities to deliver workshops in floristry, cake decorating, balloon-craft and arts and craft activities to “provide a safe, secure, stimulating, supportive and productive environment for residents”. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra said: We do not believe all these roles are necessary and have told the Home Office to speak to Mitie to remove them. The government department has not yet clarified which jobs Mitie has been directed to remove, and a number of roles remain listed on the government’s find-a-job portal, reports the PA news agency. On its website, Mitie said it aims to “treat those in our care with dignity, decency, and respect” and provide an environment for residents to “engage in activities relevant to them”. Health minister Stephen Kinnock said there had been “excessive interpretation” of contractual obligations. He told LBC: My understanding of it is, they’re contractually obliged to have some kind of physical exercise, because you want to make sure that people aren’t falling into ill health, because that just makes it even worse for the taxpayer if we’re having to deal with that kind of thing. But it seems that there’s been an excessive interpretation of those contractual obligations and Seema Malhotra, the immigration minister, I’m very pleased to say, has rapidly responded to this and instructed Mitie to delete those jobs, and that is a good move on her part. The Heathrow IRC combines Colnbrook and Harmondsworth removals centres and is, according to Mitie, the largest IRC in Europe with a capacity of 965 residents. The company has been approached by the PA news agency for comment. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax and urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued. In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as public finances are tight. “What started as a programme to boost the economy is now a massive drain on taxpayer money,” he said. “Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design. While families struggle with rising costs, the government is … [in effect] writing multibillion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.” The emergency policy, first enacted in 2009 during the global financial crisis, involved buying up £895bn of bonds from the UK’s banks and, in exchange, crediting them with reserves at the Bank of England. The Bank is now winding down QE – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – by selling the bonds at a rate of £100bn a year, but these sales are taking place at a loss. In accordance with a promise from Alistair Darling, then chancellor, the Treasury bears the financial risks of QE, so these losses hit the government’s finances. In addition, the higher Bank of England base rate, now set at 4% to combat above-target inflation, means the Bank is paying out higher interest rates on banks’ reserves than it is receiving on the bonds it holds. In total, these losses amount to a £22bn-a-year hit to the public finances, according to the IPPR. Jung calls for the Treasury to tax the big banks on their QE-related reserves, saying the profits of the big four have more than doubled since before the Covid pandemic. He says such a policy could bring in £8bn a year and sidestep the Bank’s objections to a widely mooted alternative known as “tiered reserves”, which the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has argued could interfere with its job of combating inflation. The immediate closure of asylum hotels could lead to migrants “living destitute in the streets”, a government minister said, as he warned against a “disorderly discharge”. Health minister Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: It’s not a question of if we close the hotels, it’s a question of when and how we close the hotels, and what we don’t want to have is a disorderly discharge from every hotel in the country, which would actually have far worse consequences than what we currently have, in terms of the impact that would have on asylum seekers potentially living destitute in the streets. And I don’t think any one of the communities that are campaigning on these hotels issue want to see that. So what we are doing is looking to appeal this injunction simply because we’re taking a pragmatic approach to how we want to manage the process, not because we believe that the hotel … per se should stay open.” Pressed on where the migrants would be moved to if the Bell hotel in Epping were to close, Kinnock said: We’ve got a whole range of options – disused warehouses, disused office blocks, disused military barracks. We are looking at every option that we have to manage the discharge, and it’s really important that we do that and put those plans in place, but of course, it’s going to be much more effective if we’re able to do that in a way where we’re controlling the discharge from these hotels. Later today, we should get the judgment from the three senior judges ruling on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel. It is expected at about 2pm. In other developments: The Foreign Office in London summoned Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, at 1pm, in direct response to the severe damage inflicted on the British Council building in Ukraine, government sources said. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the attacks as “senseless” and accused Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax and urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued. In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as public finances are tight. England needs to “wake up” to its faltering infant vaccination programme, experts have warned, as it was revealed that one in five children start primary school unprotected from serious infectious diseases. The government has urged parents to make sure their children are up to date with their vaccines. The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the country’s most senior chief constables has said. Serena Kennedy retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four years in charge. She criticised politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport riot. A member of the House of Lords asked a senior British diplomat to help a Ghanaian goldmining venture in which he held shares, claiming it was “in the UK national interest”, the Guardian can disclose. The revelation will add to concerns about apparent breaches of parliamentary lobbying rules by Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army. The peer is already under scrutiny over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases to investigations by the Lords’ standards body.

26) ‘It doesn’t have to be like an Airbnb’: how to travel through house swapping and sitting — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Free accommodation in someone else’s home might seem like an easy hack for cheap travel, but there’s more to house-sitting and swapping than a free room. While sitting usually involves caring for pets in exchange for accommodation, swapping requires participants to make their own home available to others for the pleasure of staying for free in someone else’s. Angela Laws, a founder of Trusted Housesitters, the world’s largest house-sitting platform with more than 200,000 active members, wants to be clear with those considering giving it a go: “It’s not a free vacation. It’s not free travel. It’s not free accommodation. It is a mutually beneficial exchange between pet parents and sitters.” She stresses too that anyone wanting to take advantage of the benefits needs to appreciate and honour the responsibilities it entails. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning On the other hand, it can work well if you have your own home. Emily Budin, an Australian living in the UK, has swapped her zone two London apartment for New York brownstones, a Christmas in Switzerland, chateaus in the south of France, Croatian villas – and more. She says, with caveats, the practice is a “super-easy” way to banish accommodation costs from your holiday budget. Swaps don’t always have to be simultaneous, which makes platforms like Home Exchange – made famous by the film The Holiday – much more convenient. Budin says its annual fee is about equivalent to one night in a decent hotel in a big European city. “You can earn points while your house is empty,” Budin says. If you’re visiting family elsewhere, and use them to “pay” for a property during a time that suits your vacation schedule. Meanwhile, when you’re away, someone else might use their points to book your place, which will in turn earn you more points. This also means the swaps don’t have to be like-for-like. Budin says a reasonable quality property in a central location might command the same points per night as a more remote but more lavish one. If your place isn’t top tier, you can still bank your points to spend on more premium properties. If you’re renting, you can still join HomeExchange, but the onus is on the swapper to check if their rental agreement allows it. Communication is key Laws says you can find a sit within 24 hours, but in her experience, “the more communication, the better”. If a listing aligns with your experience as a sitter, the first step is to reach out through the secure messaging system within the platform. Laws recommends a video call, where both parties can ask questions, take a virtual tour of the home, and even share their own living space. Hannah Wilkinson, 32, started house-sitting to see Australia on the cheap with her boyfriend in 2023 and has chronicled the experience on Substack. Two years and nearly 30 back-to-back sits later, Wilkinson says the rare hiccups she has experienced could have been avoided by more thorough communication. Laws says the sit she is currently organising has involved at least five days of back and forth to ensure everyone is on the same page. For house swappers, similar advice applies. Budin says she doesn’t always bother with a video call, but does like to make expectations clear and be sure to ask about what her hosts expect of her via messages. She says even when “rules” aren’t explicitly outlined, it’s expected that you won’t be treating the property as if you’re a paying customer, but rather a personal house guest: “You’d be neighbourly, make sure to put the bins out, things like that.” Be flexible Wilkinson likens the house-sitting to backpacking: “You need to be organised, but you also need to be completely open to the unexpected.” She and her boyfriend, for example, spent a few weeks in Jindabyne simply because the opportunity arose. Swapping can also be pretty spontaneous, according to Budin, who says that if her husband were also a remote worker, she believes they could stay elsewhere “every other week if we wanted to”. Be organised Wilkinson says staying on top of what’s available and being prompt with messages go a long way to securing the most desirable house-sits. She likes to lock things in about a month in advance. Budin says the preparation for swapping can be a “bit of a headache”. She increases her cleaners’ hours before and after having people stay at her place. While it’s not expected that all your personal effects will be removed, it’s customary to leave empty shelves in the fridge, pantry, closet and vanity, she says. “It doesn’t have to be like an Airbnb, but it definitely has to be livable.” Is it weird? Budin says it’s all a state of mind. If you come to terms with people being in your space, house swapping is a legitimately good way to access properties you might not otherwise be able to afford. “You’re either a house swapper or you’re not,” she says. “But for me, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.” She says while she has come home to surprises, like the house being messier than anticipated – and once finding a vibrator left behind in her dresser – she has never had anything broken or stolen. “I’m sure there’s been a few men that have worn my underwear, but what you don’t know won’t hurt you.” “There’s also insurances that are in place and a holding deposit that’s kept every time you swap,” she says. Emmanuel Arnaud, the CEO and co-founder of HomeExchange, told Guardian Australia via email that the platform had facilitated nearly half a million swaps in 2024, up 42% on 2023, and that 99.7% of exchanges occur without incident. For Wilkinson, arriving at one house-sit to discover there was an expectation that the dogs would share her bed was “a bit much,” but she says this kind of detail can be ironed out in advance. Pets are the priority when sitting Of house-sitting, Wilkinson says simply: “If you aren’t into pets, just don’t even consider it.” She has had to scrub poop out of carpets and once devoted weeks to caring for a blind pug whose health deteriorated rapidly in their owner’s absence. The experience, she says, was like “looking after a toddler”. Even with a healthy animal, she points out, “you’re going to have to give up at least an hour of your day”. While you can be strategic and look for sits with independent felines or older dogs that need less exercise, the fact remains that caring for pets is what you are doing in exchange for accommodation, so it needs to be seen as a job.

27) US denies visas to Palestinian Authority leaders for UN general assembly — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The US has begun denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) in advance of the UN general assembly meeting in September, the state department said on Friday. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was included in the restrictions. Abbas had been planning to travel to New York to deliver an address to the UN general assembly. Abbas’ office said it was astonished by the visa decision and argued that it violated the UN “headquarters agreement”. Under an agreement as host of the UN in New York, the US is not supposed to refuse visas for officials heading to the world body for the general assembly, but the state department said it was complying with the agreement by allowing the Palestinian mission to attend. “The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,” the state department said in a statement. The new measure further aligns Donald Trump’s administration with Israel’s rightwing government which adamantly rejects a Palestinian state. Israeli officials have repeatedly equated the broadly secular PA, which exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, with its bitter Islamist rival Hamas. Using a term favoured by Trump to deride his legal troubles while out of office, the state department accused the Palestinians of “lawfare” by raising grievances against Israel at the international criminal court and international court of justice. It called on the PA to drop “efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state”. The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, thanked the Trump administration “for this bold step and for standing by Israel once again” in a post on X. Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said it was “important” for all states and observers, which includes the Palestinians, to be represented at a summit scheduled for the day before the general assembly begins. “We obviously hope that this will be resolved,” Dujarric said. The US statement justifying the new measure echoed claims often repeated by Israeli officials. “Before the PLO and PA can be considered partners for peace, they must consistently repudiate terrorism – including the 7 October massacre – and end incitement to terrorism in education,” it said. The PLO was founded in 1964 as an umbrella organisation for Palestinian factions and recognised a decade later as the sole political representative of the Palestinian people. The PA was set up almost 20 years later as an interim body that would provide an institutional framework for a Palestinian state. Both are likely to be integral to any future Palestinian state. Arab powers, the UK, European countries and others want the PA to take a central role in the administration of Gaza if the conflict can be ended, though they agree it needs reform. Australia, Canada, the UK and France are to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly next month if certain conditions are met, in a move that has infuriated Israel. Israel’s government has rejected any role for the PA in Gaza and said that recognition “rewards Hamas’s monstrous terrorism”. Though Israel’s government is under mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its offensive in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has ordered military forces to launch an assault to seize Gaza City. Once a major commercial and cultural hub, it has been reduced to ruins and is home to hundreds of thousands of destitute Palestinians after repeated rounds of fighting. The Israeli offensive has so far killed 63,000 people, mostly civilians, injured 150,000 and displaced the vast majority of the population. The UN last week declared a famine in and around Gaza City, blaming “systematic obstruction” by Israel of humanitarian aid deliveries. “We have begun preliminary operations and the initial stages of the attack on Gaza City, and we are currently operating with great force on the outskirts of the city,” Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesperson, said on X. The war was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 abducted. About 50 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom less than half are thought to be still alive. Activists each year press the US to deny visas to leaders of countries that they oppose, often over grave human rights violations, but their appeals are almost always rejected. In a historic step in 1988, the general assembly convened in Geneva rather than New York to hear the then PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, after the US refused to allow him in New York.

28) Labour won the legal battle over asylum hotels, but the right is running the story — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Protesters were already gathering outside the Bell hotel by Friday evening with union flags and St George’s flags waving. This court ruling was never going to end as a quiet legal moment. For the Home Office, the court of appeal’s decision was a practical win. If the ruling had gone the other way, the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils. Since there is scant alternative accommodation available, this ruling buys the government time. Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year. If the closures proceed, the ruling means they still have time to deliver their promise of shutting all the hotels down “in a controlled and orderly way” by 2029. But political tensions have, of course, been reignited. Nigel Farage immediately jumped on the moment, accusing the government of “using the law against the people of Epping”. He said “illegal migrants now have more rights than the people of Essex” and promised Reform UK would “put an end to this”. This is the kind of high-emotion, high-visibility moment Farage thrives on and is a story that plays into his hands. Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, also piled in, telling supporters on X: “Judges side with illegal migrants against British people. ECHR used by judges to overrule planning law, democratic protests and the safety of Epping residents.” The government remains stuck in the same political fight: trying to stave off challenges from the right while at the same time getting on with the job of ensuring there is a functioning political project that can communicate its wins. Kemi Badenoch, the opposition leader, has told Tory councils to “keep going” with their legal challenges, despite the court ruling making it clear that protest and local pressure will not count in planning law. Views in her party slant right on the issue, but not exclusively. One senior Conservative MP said: “They’re human beings – they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?” But another backbencher said: “We have to make it impossible for them to stay open.” Farage had described the mood in the country on Tuesday around the issue of immigration as being “a mix between total despair and rising anger”. Yet he persistently confuses irregular migrants with asylum seekers who are fleeing harm. Recent polling shows the issue is one of voters’ biggest concerns, with a YouGov poll revealing 71% of voters think Keir Starmer is handling the asylum crisis poorly, including a majority of his own supporters. Nearly seven in 10 said immigration levels were too high, which indicates why Farage was able to seize another moment this week to claim a “genuine threat to public order” unless this issue is solved. The government says its plan is working: the backlog is falling and deportations are increasing, and a deal with France has been signed. But as of Friday evening, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had not commented publicly. The last post on X from the official Labour party account is a photo of Farage with the caption: “No plan. No idea.” There is still a long way to go before Labour can look back on what it has achieved in its first parliament. But public mood is shifting faster than policy. This Labour government did inherit a broken system, and a large number of hotels opened by the Conservatives. But it has not stopped the Tories washing their hands of it, or Farage from circling. On the streets outside the Bell hotel, the noise is getting louder, along with fears there could be more protests across the country to come.

29) IDF declares famine-hit Gaza City a combat zone, ending ‘tactical pauses’ that allowed limited food delivery – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has declared Gaza City “a dangerous combat zone” as the military prepares for an assault on the shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. In a post on X, the IDF wrote: “In accordance with the situational assessment &amp; directives of the political echelon, starting today at 10:00, the local tactical pause in military activity will not apply to the area of Gaza City, which constitutes a dangerous combat zone.” The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department said in a statement on Friday. The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports. Israel’s foreign minister has hailed the US decision as a “bold step” on Friday. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said earlier this week that the evacuation of Gaza City is “inevitable”. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will launch its Gaza City assault while simultaneously pursuing a ceasefire, though talks have stalled. Israel has recovered the body of hostage Ilan Weiss from the Gaza Strip, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has confirmed. The body of a second person, whose identity has not yet been cleared for publication, was also retrieved, the statement added. At least 63,025 Palestinian people have been killed and 159,490 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. At least 59 Palestinian people, including 23 aid seekers, were killed in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. Israel targeted the Houthi group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior figures in airstrikes on Sanaa in Yemen on Thursday, and was still verifying the outcome, an Israeli military official said on Friday. Yemeni government sources told Reuters that Asaad al-Sharqabi, who oversaw the group’s defence ministry, was killed in the strikes. Gaza City is being gripped by famine caused by Israel’s restrictions on aid and the assault will only deepen the widespread suffering of the civilian population there and could forcibly displace an estimated one million Palestinian people. A joint statement from a number of UN organisations including Unicef and the World Food Programme said “it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist”. Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying they were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”, and denied the existence of a famine in Gaza. Mohammed Abu Afash, the director of the medical charity, the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, has told Al Jazeera that the southern part of the territory is extremely dangerous for civilians as the Israeli military is targeting areas it claims are safe zones. Afash told Al Jazeera that the army is targeting people who are waiting for food and residents sheltering in their homes, and that southern Gaza cannot accommodate the volume of people who will be displaced from Gaza City by Israel’s assault. More than 500 staff at the UN have urged its human rights chief, Volker Türk, to describe Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide being committed against the Palestinian people. In a letter to Türk, staff reportedly claimed that the legal criteria for genocide – which, under international law, is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group – has been met. The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. A spokesman for Gaza’s only Catholic church said some 440 people who have taken shelter there had unanimously agreed to stay, despite word that the IDF has declared Gaza City “a dangerous combat zone” and is preparing for an assault on the shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. Farid Jubran told The Associated Press on Friday that five clergy have also stayed in the church to assist those sheltering, which include women, children and older people. Israel’s foreign minister has hailed the US decision to deny Palestinian officials visas for next month’s UN general assembly, where France is leading a push to recognise a Palestinian state, as a “bold step” on Friday. “We thank [President Donald Trump] and the administration for this bold step and for standing by Israel once again,” Gideon Saar posted on his official X account. “Thank you [secretary of state Marco Rubio] for holding the “PLO” [Palestine Liberation Organization] and PA [Palestinian Authority] accountable for rewarding terrorism, incitement and efforts to use legal warfare against Israel,” he added.

A joint statement from a number of UN organisations including Unicef and the World Food Programme said “it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist”. The director of the UN World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, said it is “very evident” there isn’t enough food in Gaza, adding that starvation was clearly under way in the territory. Her comments were made to the Associated Press during a visit to Gaza earlier this week and echo the declaration last Friday of widespread famine in Gaza made by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying they were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”, and denied the existence of a famine in Gaza.

The Israeli military has expressed “its regret” after Lebanon’s army reported two of its soldiers were killed when an Israeli drone that crashed in the country’s south exploded. Lebanon’s army said its personnel were inspecting the drone that had fallen in the Naqura area on Thursday when it exploded, killing an officer and a soldier and wounding two others, according to a report from AFP. The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. Iranian oil minister Mohsen Paknejad said on Friday a return of sanctions under the so-called “snapback” may create restrictions on oil exports but Tehran has learned to bypass them, Iran’s state media reported. Britain, France and Germany on Thursday launched a 30-day process to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear programme, a step likely to stoke tensions two months after Israel and the United States bombed Iran. “We have faced restrictions on oil sales for years, and this has led to us gaining the necessary expertise in bypassing sanctions,” Paknejad told state media. “Naturally snapback may create conditions requiring new measures but we are not tied down by these restrictions.” The US denial of visas to Palestinian officials ahead of the UN general assembly meeting follow the imposition of sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July. In a statement, the state department said that “it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace.” Officials with the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, reject that they’ve undermined peace prospects, Reuters reports. Under the 1947 UN ‘headquarters agreement’ the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons. The state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate. An Israeli army position is set up along the fence separating the Gaza Strip from southern Israel, earlier today. The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department said in a statement on Friday. The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports. The move follows the imposition of US sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July, even as other Western powers moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood. In its statement, the state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate. Israel targeted the Houthi group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior figures in airstrikes on Sanaa in Yemen on Thursday, and was still verifying the outcome, an Israeli military official said on Friday. Yemeni government sources told Reuters that Asaad al-Sharqabi, who oversaw the group’s defence ministry, was killed in the strikes. They added that another Israeli raid targeted a military site frequented by the Houthis’ chief of staff, Muhammad Abd Al-Karim al-Ghamari. The Houthi group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Israeli military said fighter jets struck a compound in the Sanaa area where senior Houthi figures had gathered, describing the attack as a “complex operation” made possible by intelligence-gathering and air superiority. “We took advantage of an intelligence window of opportunity to carry out the strike and acted with precision and speed at the right moment,” a military official said in a statement. Hundreds of employees of the United Nations’ leading human rights agency have backed an internal letter telling its leadership to declare Israel’s offensive in Gaza a genocide and to call on UN member states to suspend arms sales to Israel. The 1,100-word letter, signed by about a quarter of the 2,000 staff of the Geneva- and New York-based Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), says the Israeli offensive in Gaza meets the legal threshold of genocide and that this means “arms sales, transfers and related logistical or financial support to Israeli authorities” constitutes a clear breach of international law by all those involved. OHCHR employees told the Guardian they were frustrated with the failure of agency’s head, Volker Türk, to “move beyond condemning Israel”. “The messaging has been the same for almost two years. Criticising Israel is not enough. He needs to be saying exactly what steps member states need to take to meet their obligations to prevent genocide and very firmly pointing out the legal consequences for leaders, officials and private businesses if they don’t,” said one staff member who signed the letter. Another praised Türk’s criticism of Israel for grave breaches of international law and apparent war crimes but charged that the decision to avoid clearer public statements about genocide was “a political not a legal choice”. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says that based on the “available evidence and authoritative assessments by the UN-appointed experts, as well as legal and [international humanitarian law] professionals, the legal threshold [for genocide] has been met. [We] therefore urge the Office to state the legal characterization publicly.” William Christou is a Beirut-based journalist The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. The approved resolution said Unifil would begin an “orderly and safe withdrawal” of its 10,800 peacekeepers from Lebanon in December 2026. The planned withdrawal will end the more than 47-year-long peacekeeping mission. Initially created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Unifil’s soldiers patrol the shared border between Israel and Lebanon. The force has been tasked with monitoring and reporting violations of the November ceasefire between Hezbollah and Lebanon, so the Lebanese army can enforce the terms of the agreement. You can read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from Gaza City: At least 63,025 Palestinian people have been killed and 159,490 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. At least 59 Palestinian people, including 23 aid seekers, were killed in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. In a post on Telegram, the health ministry wrote: A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the streets, as ambulances and civil defense crews are unable to reach them until now. Over the past 24 hours, hospitals in the Gaza Strip recorded five new deaths due to famine and malnutrition, including two children, the ministry said in a separate post. This brings the total number of Palestinian people who have died from famine and malnutrition to 322, including 121 children. Figures from the health ministry are generally seen as reliable by the UN and other international organisations. Mohammed Abu Qamar, 42, who is originally from the Jabalia camp in northern Gaza, is travelling to the south under threat from the expanded Israeli assault. “We don’t want to leave our home. We’re exhausted, driven north and south with no relief,” he told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency by telephone, adding that his “heart is burning”. “Death is closing in around us. We walk on the road, not knowing if we’ll reach safety or die halfway there.” Mohammed Abu Afash, the director of the medical charity, the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, has told Al Jazeera that the southern part of the territory is extremely dangerous for civilians as the Israeli military is targeting areas it claims are safe zones.

Lebanon’s army said its personnel were inspecting the drone that had fallen in the Naqura area on Thursday when it exploded, killing an officer and a soldier and wounding two others, according to a report from AFP. The Israeli army’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee wrote on X that the military had on Thursday “attacked an engineering vehicle in the Naqura area in southern Lebanon that was preparing to rebuild Hezbollah military infrastructure in the area”. He added that during the raid, “a technical malfunction occurred” which meant the munition failed to explode and fell to the ground, “with subsequent reports indicating several Lebanese army casualties.” Adraee said an investigation was underway “to determine if the incident was caused by the explosion of Israeli weapons,” adding that the military “expresses its regret for the injury of Lebanese army soldiers”. Pro-Palestinian campaigners are preparing to set sail for Gaza from Spain on Sunday in dozens of boats and have called on governments to pressure Israel into allowing their flotilla to pass through a naval blockade. Greta Thunberg and is among hundreds of people from 44 counties due on the flotilla. In June, the Israeli navy boarded and seized a boat containing Thunberg that attempted to break the blockade. It is the last day of recess for the British parliament and, as MPs prepare to head back to Westminster, a reminder that the UK’s prime minister Keir Starmer said in July that the country will formally recognise the state of Palestine this September unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution in the Middle East. An official government statement issued on 29 July night said the UK would recognise Palestine at the UN general assembly unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire, makes it clear it will not annex the West Bank, and “takes substantive steps” to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza including by allowing the UN to supply aid. This effectively requires Israel to revive the prospect of a two-state solution, an idea that Benjamin Netanyahu has long rejected. Recognition is a symbolic step but one that would infuriate the Israeli government, which argues that it would encourage Hamas and reward terrorism. It is in effect a formal, political acknowledgment of Palestinian self-determination – without the need to engage in thorny practicalities such as the location of its borders or capital city. It also allows the establishment of full diplomatic relations. Israel has recovered the body of hostage Ilan Weiss from the Gaza Strip, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has confirmed. The body of a second person, whose identity has not yet been cleared for publication, was also retrieved, the statement added. In a tribute to Weiss, Israeli president Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X: 692 days after he was brutally kidnapped with his wife Shiri and their daughter Noga, Ilan’s body was recovered in a joint IDF and Shin Bet operation. A moment of deep sorrow, but also of closure. Ilan showed courage and noble spirit when he fought the terrorists on that dark day. In his death, he gave life. And ever since, his family has shown extraordinary strength in their struggle for his return. Gaza City is being gripped by famine caused by Israel’s restrictions on aid and the assault will only deepen the widespread suffering of the civilian population there and could forcibly displace an estimated one million Palestinian people. A joint statement from a number of UN organisations including Unicef and the World Food Programme said “it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist”. “Many people – especially sick and malnourished children, older people and people with disabilities – may be unable to evacuate,” it said. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said earlier this week that the evacuation of Gaza City is “inevitable”. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will launch its Gaza City assault while simultaneously pursuing a ceasefire, though talks have stalled. The Israeli prime minister has claimed the assault is the best way to weaken Hamas and return hostages, but many hostage families disagree and fear it will endanger hostages lives. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on southern Israel in 2023. Most hostages have been released during previous ceasefires. About 50 remain in Gaza, and Israeli officials believe about 20 are still alive. Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging ceasefire negotiations – and blocking their progress – to ensure his own political survival by having the war continue. The Israeli leader is on trial in Israel for alleged corruption and is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. He denies all the charges against him. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has declared Gaza City “a dangerous combat zone” as the military prepares for an assault on the shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. In a post on X, the IDF wrote: In accordance with the situational assessment &amp; directives of the political echelon, starting today at 10:00, the local tactical pause in military activity will not apply to the area of Gaza City, which constitutes a dangerous combat zone. The IDF continues supporting humanitarian efforts while conducting operations to protect Israel. Planes and tanks have reportedly been pounding parts of Gaza City over the past week and Israeli tanks and armored vehicles have been deployed to its outskirts. Around one million Palestinian people, many of whom are too frail or old to keep moving, are expected to be displaced by Israel’s expanded assault in the area, where a UN-backed food body declared earlier this month that a famine was taking place. More than 500 staff at the UN have urged its human rights chief, Volker Türk, to describe Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide being committed against the Palestinian people. In a letter to Türk, staff reportedly claimed that the legal criteria for genocide – which, under international law, is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group – has been met. In the letter, seen by the Reuters news agency and Al Jazeera, the UN staff said failure to describe Israel’s assault as a genocide “undermines” the UN’s credibility. It was reportedly signed by the Staff Committee on behalf of more than 500 employees at the Geneva-based office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR), and sent to Türk earlier this week. “OHCHR has a strong legal and moral responsibility to denounce acts of genocide,” said the letter, which called on Türk to take a “clear and public position”. “Failing to denounce an unfolding genocide undermines the credibility of the UN and the human rights system itself,” it added. It cited the international body’s perceived moral failure for not doing more to stop the 1994 Rwanda genocide that killed more than 1 million people. Turk has the full and unconditional support of the UN secretary general António Guterres, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, adding: “Labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal authority.” South Africa’s case against Israel at the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) accusing the state of committing genocide is ongoing. Israel denies the charges. There has been a worsening in relations between Israel and the UK over recent months. The UK government said in July it would recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution in the Middle East, enraging the Israeli government. The UK has sanctioned far-right Israeli ministers and those who committed settler violence, and broken off trade negotiations with Israel over its military conduct in Gaza. But Keir Starmer’s government has been accused inside of the UK of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to the territory and killed over 62,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are women and children, according to officials. Despite Israel being accused of war crimes and of committing genocide in Gaza, the UK has still allowed arms sales to Israel and has run surveillance flights over Gaza with the help of a US contractor. Israel’s defence ministry has criticised the UK government for excluding its officials from a London arms fair next month, calling it an act of “discrimination”. A UK government spokesperson said earlier that no Israeli government delegation would be invited to attend the Defence &amp; Security Equipment International (DSEI) event, which will feature national delegations and private companies who showcase military equipment and weapons at London’s Excel centre. The spokesperson said the Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its assault in Gaza was wrong, in comments seemingly in reference to Israel’s plan to launch a massive new assault on Gaza City within weeks. “As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025,” the spokesperson said. “There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,” the spokesperson added. Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion at the trade show as it has done previously. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael, IAI and Uvision, will still be able to attend. “These restrictions amount to a deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination against Israel’s representatives. Accordingly, the Israel Ministry of Defence will withdraw from the exhibition and will not establish a national pavilion,” Israel’s defence ministry said in a statement. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this morning that Europe wants to find diplomatic solutions to the Iranian nuclear programme question. “We are entering a new phase with this 30 days that is now giving us also the opportunity to really find diplomatic ways to find a solution,” Kallas told journalists. “We have this 30 days to sort things out,” she added. Iran has been enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, a short step from the roughly 90% of bomb-grade, and had enough material enriched to that level, if refined further, for six nuclear weapons, before airstrikes by Israel (and then the US) were launched on Iranian nuclear sites in June, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. The west says the advancement of Iran’s nuclear programme goes beyond civilian needs, while Tehran says it wants nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. Patrick Wintour is diplomatic editor for the Guardian The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites or face deeper worldwide economic isolation. UK officials said the decision had not been taken lightly and there had been intensive diplomacy to try to avert this step. The officials emphasised there was still room for last-ditch diplomacy before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force in 30 days’ time. The annual high-level UN general assembly in September is likely to involve more intensive diplomacy over the situation with Iran. They added that Iran had been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity to become compliant but had either been unwilling or unable to act. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Iran after Israel bombed its key nuclear sites, and has been unable to renegotiate a return to assess the state of those sites. Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the Bushehr site, where refuelling is due to occur. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the decision by the three European countries in a call on Thursday morning. You can read the full story here: Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying they were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”, and denied the existence of a famine in Gaza. We mentioned the findings of the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in our opening post. Here is a bit more detail about the report which said last week that more than half a million people across Gaza are facing “catastrophic” conditions characterised by “starvation, destitution and death”. The IPC said an “entirely man-made” famine is happening in Gaza City, the territory’s largest, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month. Only four famines have been declared by the IPC since it was established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year. The IPC is a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report says. It continues: The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay – even by days – will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality. If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and (sanitation and water) services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially. We are restarting our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. The director of the UN World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, said it is “very evident” there isn’t enough food in Gaza, adding that starvation was clearly under way in the territory. Her comments were made to the Associated Press during a visit to Gaza earlier this week and echo the declaration last Friday of widespread famine in Gaza made by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. “I personally met mothers and children who were starving in Gaza,” McCain said. “It is real and it is happening now.” McCain said she spoke with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and claimed he is “concerned” about the issue. In the past, Netanyahu has denied the existence of famine in Gaza and said the claims about starvation are a propaganda campaign launched by Hamas and spread by the media. “We agreed that we must immediately redouble our efforts to get more humanitarian aid in. Access and security for our convoys is critical,” McCain said. Netanyahu has presided over a government that has been starving Gaza by limiting the amount of aid coming into the territory. Charities say there are ongoing obstructions in being able to collect and distribute aid. In March and April Gaza was under total siege, with no food entering. Israel justified what was widely seen as the collective punishment of the civilian population as a tactic to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. In mid-May Netanyahu said shipments would restart because of international pressure over a “starvation crisis”. But the amount of food and basic essentials let into the territory is still woefully inadequate and many Palestinian people have been killed while trying to collect aid. Stay with us as we give you the latest updates on Gaza throughout the day.

30) Palace must keep Guéhi because finding replacement ‘almost impossible’, says Glasner — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     Oliver Glasner has made clear that Crystal Palace must not sell Marc Guéhi before Monday’s transfer deadline because finding a replacement for the England defender will be “almost impossible”. Palace, who confirmed the signing of Spain forward Yeremy Pino from Villarreal on Friday, have agreed a fee worth up to €27m (£23.4m) with Toulouse for Jaydee Canvot, with the France Under-20 defender expected to sign a five-year contract. Palace have been desperate to add defensive reinforcements amid uncertainty over Guéhi’s future and Canvot is seen as a player with huge potential having made his breakthrough in Ligue 1 last season. But the FA Cup winners have been frustrated so far in their attempts to find a more experienced option. They have approached Manchester City over a deal for Manuel Akanji but the Switzerland defender has interest from Milan and Spurs so looks likely to move elsewhere, while Palace have also made inquiries about taking Mohammed Salisu on loan from Monaco. Liverpool have yet to meet Palace’s £40m valuation for Guéhi, who has one year on his contract, and Glasner wants him to stay. “From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,” said the Palace manager. “When we see our foundation of success in the last few months, it’s our defence … Marc is a crucial part. Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.” Palace are in the market for more attacking reinforcements. They have had an approach for David Brooks turned down by Bournemouth and could follow up interest in Christoph Baumgartner of RB Leipzig.

     Your Guardian Sport weekend is here. Your Premier League fixtures here: Saturday Chelsea v Fulham (12:30 BST) Man Utd v Burnley Sunderland v Brentford Tottenham v Bournemouth Wolves v Everton Leeds v Newcastle (17:30 BST) Sunday Brighton v Man City (14:00 BST) Nottingham Forest v West Ham (14:00 BST) Liverpool v Arsenal (16:30 BST) Aston Villa v Crystal Palace (19:00 BST) Confirmed: Tottenham sign Xavi Simons. They finally get their man. Chelsea were also interested in Simons but never made a bid for the 22-year-old Netherlands international. Chelsea are well stocked in attacking midfield, despite agreeing a £36m deal for Christopher Nkunku to join Milan. They have focused on a £40m deal for the Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and have targets beyond Simons, including Barcelona’s Fermín López. Major story here from Nick Ames: will domestic Uefa leagues be able to go on world tours? There is a broad acceptance within Uefa that the proposal will be difficult to reject without altering its statutes. Even then the plan appears to have irresistible momentum. Potential legal arguments against moving matches abroad have lost weight since the US-based promoter Relevent Sports agreed a settlement with Fifa in April 2024 to dismiss the global governing body from a lawsuit challenging its policy of barring league games from being staged in other countries. More from Thomas Tuchel at his press call today. I’m experienced enough, I should have known better and should have done better. I thought I have a little bit more credit with you guys, that I do all this in my second language. Will Unwin has been hearing from Pep Guardiola. James Trafford is in the Claudio Bravo position; will Gianluigi Donnarumma come in? Not this weekend, for sure. All the clubs, before the international transfer window is closed, everything is possible. It’s as simple as that. After that, we’re going to play [Manchester] United and Champions League and Arsenal. After everything will be more clear and now we take a decision. It depends on the performance and it depends on many reasons. Borussia Dortmund have confirmed the signing of Fabio Silva from Wolves in a deal worth £22.8m. The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract with Dortmund, having cost Wolves £35m in 2020 and struggled to ever establish himself. A series of loans have seen him play very little for Wolves in recent times; he scored four goals in 62 matches. There was talent there. Perhaps Dortmund can unlock it. Ben Fisher heard from Nuno on his relationship with “the president”. I’m totally relaxed in that sense. We need to have a talk about the future of the club, how we should address after the transfer market and all these things – what is the commitment to the club. Me and the president want the same thing. We want the best for Forest, that’s for sure. Here’s Jamie Jackson, reporting from that weird and wonderful press conference from Ruben Amorim. This is my way of doing things and I’m going to be like that. In that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm: I’m not going to be like that. Thomas Frank, at his Spurs press conference, entered with a gag. “We have a new international player in the squad... in Djed Spence.” Ho ho. But what of Xavi Simons? ““I hope they get good news later today for various reasons because we’re trying to sign players and that we will try to do until the end of the transfer window. I can confirm that we are working very hard to get someone over the line, that I can confirm.” Mystery and comedy. Is there nothing the man can’t do? I was at Fulham on Sunday, and these news conference comments from Marco Silva sound very familiar. Are Fulham trying to get away without signing a single outfield player? “We have a fantastic group of players here, but we still need depth, quality and competition. We need at least three players. “We are still looking to strengthen our attacking line with two players and one midfielder, which is what we had planned. We probably need a striker as well but that probably isn’t going to be possible.” “There’s nothing very close right now, let’s see what happens. But, as a manager, I think we don’t have any other option but to do it because otherwise we won’t be in the condition to play in the Premier League. I think we have wasted a lot of time. If we can bring players in now, they will have to adapt and settle as quick as can be.” Crystal Palace have agreed a fee worth up to €27m with Toulouse for Jaydee Canvot, with the France Under-20 defender expected to sign a five-year contract at Selhurst Park. Palace have been desperate to add defensive reinforcements amid uncertainty over Marc Guehi’s future and Canvot is seen as a player with huge potential having made his breakthrough in Ligue 1 last season. They are also understood to be looking for a more experienced option and have approached Manchester City over a deal for Manuel Akanji, as well as making enquiries about taking Mohammed Salisu on loan from Monaco. But Glasner made it clear on Friday that he wants Guehi, who has only one year of his contract at Selhurst Park remaining, to stay. “From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guehi replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,” said the Palace manager. “When we see our foundation of success in the last few months, it’s our defence... Marc is a crucial part. Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.” Mikel Arteta has admitted that Arsenal must discover why they are suffering so many injuries after confirming that Bukayo Saka will miss Sunday’s showdown with Liverpool due to a hamstring issue. The England forward is set to be out for weeks rather than months after sustaining the problem against Leeds, while Arteta revealed that captain Martin Odegaard is also a major doubt for Anfield due to a shoulder injury having not trained all week. Kai Havertz has had knee surgery which could keep him out for more than a month, with more concerns over Leandro Trossard, Ben White and Christian Norgaard’s participation against Arne Slot’s reigning champions. The long-term absence of Gabriel Jesus means that Arsenal - who suffered 27 major injuries last season that ultimately undermined their title bid - could be without seven first team players for only their third match of the new campaign. “First of all, we have to analyse what we do. That’s for sure,” said Arteta. “I think in the previous season we were there. We had the best record in the Premier League. The following season we had one of the worst as well because the extent, not the amount, but the extent of the injuries of certain players, especially Tomiyasu, Gabi Jesús, the long-term injuries we have with the hamstring injuries. “So we have looked at everything. We are continually monitoring and evolving the needs of the players and the schedule. But unfortunately, we picked very diverse injuries again. Probably some of them were very unexpected.” Reporting from the Tuchel presser: Your “repulsive” quote about Bellingham? “I did this unintentionally. I used this word unintentionally. Just to make that very clear. There was no message, there was no hidden agenda. I fully understood and understand that it’s my responsibility that I created these headlines. I’m sorry for the upset. I was sorry and I am sorry for the upset and for the headlines. I am experienced enough. I should have known better. I should have done better. I thought I had a little bit more credit maybe with you guys given this is my second language. I did it on the morning after a loss. Not a lot of sleep. I did it in a live interview and then used the wrong word. Again, it’s my responsibility. I used the wrong word. I didn’t want to use this word and I created the upset.” Did you speak to Jude about it? “Yes. I contacted him straight away about it. Jude focuses now on his rehabilitation and we focus on Andorra and Serbia.” Done deal: Crystal Palace announce the signing of Yeremy Pino. He will wear the No 10 shirt recently vacated by Eberechi Eze. Potted bio via Palace’s website: Born in Las Palmas, Pino’s senior breakthrough arrived at Villarreal in the 2020/21 season, scoring in the UEFA Europa League just a week after making his professional debut. By the end of the campaign, he had become the youngest Spanish player to ever start a major European final, and the youngest to win the Europa League, lifting the trophy after defeating Manchester United in Gdańsk. Briefly back to Thomas Tuchel. “Trent” is not in the squad but Djed Spence is. Though as a left-back. “Djed comes to camp as a left-back together with Myles and fights for his position there. It’s a first call-up. I think it’s very well deserved. He had a very strong end to the season, won a major trophy and a very strong start to the season with Tottenham. He played very impressively in the European Super Cup. “He is a very aggressive player who loves to have on on one duels, is not shy to be in one-on-one duels with the most talented, and the fastest players who play on the right wing out there, so strong start to the season straight away and he’s a big part of Tottenham’s success at the moment and everyone told us he is very focused at the moment. Very focused on training, very keen to get better. We can see this, and that’s why we called him up.” More Marinakis on Nuno: “We have a solid relationship…and everything is solid. We all want Nottingham [Forest] to succeed.” So, peace in our time? Let’s see. Good afternoon. After Evangelos Marinakis, at the Europa League draw, said his relationship with Nuno was “sorted”, the manager himself has been speaking. “We need to talk. We didn’t have a chance this week. It was a tough week for both of us. A lot of work. The president now is in Monaco, as you are aware. But we will have a talk. I think always these kinds of things should be done in the right moment, and the right moment is after the game. Now we are focssed on West Ham. Then we have international break and that’s the right moment. “Things are okay. We are working very hard to compete. This is the main.. And what is really important, the talk, will happen after the game, normal here.” Okay, that’s my stint done. Time to hand over to John Brewin, who’ll bring you news from the Nuno Espirito Santo press conference. This should be interesting as Nuno has just said he “thinks” he will still be in charge of Nottingham Forest after the international break. Here’s Thomas Tuchel on leaving out Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish from his latest England squad. First of all, we decided on a bit more competitive squad. There is no doubt that I’m a big fan of Trent and Jack because of their talent and their personalities. They are big players. They will always be big players, and they will always be in the mix to be called up. I know that both of them are desperate to come back, which is really important. So competition is up, then they will stay in the mix. I know how desperate they are to come back but they can maybe have a bit more rhythm. Alejandro Garnacho has arrived at Chelsea’s training ground in advance of his £40million move from Manchester United, head coach Enzo Maresca has confirmed. A deal was agreed on Thursday between the parties after the 21-year-old was made surplus to requirements at Old Trafford. He was at Cobham on Friday afternoon to undergo a medical and finalise the move. “I know he is around here,” said Maresca. “I don’t know exactly where.” Asked how he was the United academy graduate fitting into his team, Maresca said: “He’s a winger. I see him as a winger.” The Italian would not rule out the possibility of more arrivals and departures before Monday’s deadline. “You can expect anything, the transfer window is open, anything can happen in and out,” he said. (PA Media) Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been talking to the press and admits that emotions often get the better of him. That was certainly the case after the shock loss at Grimsby in midweek when he blurted out that “something has to change” after watching his side lose on penalties to the League Two side. Every time in the future we have one defeat like that I’m going to be like that, I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I defend my players and sometimes I think I cannot. This is my way of doing things and I’m going to be like that. I felt that in that moment, I was so frustrated, I was so annoyed. I felt we had a very good pre-season, we were playing better, we were being consistent in the way we played. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham and that kind of performance (against Grimsby) I was really disappointed with everything, but now it’s a new game (home to Burnley this weekend) and we focus on that. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years. Sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. I need to improve on that, it’s going to be hard but now I’m focused on the next game. Meanwhile in America, much excitement surrounds Son Heung-min’s home debut for Los Angeles FC. They’re particularly giddy in LA’s Koreatown neighbourhood. Nick Ames was in Monaco for the Europa League and Conference League draws. And he couldn’t help but notice that Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, and Palace co-owner, Steve Parish, were sat a matter of yards from one another. After their humiliating Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby, is this a good time to play Manchester United? Burnley are the visitors to Old Trafford on Saturday and here’s Clarets boss Scott Parker on whether the hosts will be fuming and ready to deliver a response or a jibbering wreck there for the taking. There’s always noise around every team. I understand that, sometimes that noise can be blown up. There’s no doubt that Man Utd are in a place that is an uncomfortable place. The ups and downs and the bumps of football sometimes bring different results, of course. But we’re under no illusions of the task we have ahead of us at the weekend. I don’t really look into whether it’s a good or a bad time to go there. There’s always flip sides to that. You can look at one side of it and say, it’s a bit of a wounded animal with world-class players that can obviously have a reaction. On the other side, of course, there may be a bit of edginess, but fundamentally, we’ll try and give our best version and take on the task of going to play Manchester United at Old Trafford. Here’s Max Rushden with some early-season observations. And talking of which… On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and newly announced panellists: Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for Football Weekly Live at the Troxy, London. Book tickets at theguardian.com/footballweeklylive Thomas Tuchel believes Elliott Anderson has “a lot of volume”. His hair? The noises he makes in training? Anyway, here’s the England manager on Anderson and Tino Livramento following today’s squad annoucenment . Elliot Anderson, very physical, a lot of volume, very precise clean passing, it is a good package. Tino Livramento is also with us based on these observations because they had a fantastic tournament. Elliot was a key player in the tournament, pressed a lot in central midfield, (he’s) a regular player for Nottingham Forest, they had a fantastic season and ended the season with a title for the Under-21s. He has started the season and I guess he is excited to come and join us and I hope he can make his mark. The Alexander Isak saga (turns to camera, “nice”). It’s been more a slow show than fast show this summer but Louise Taylor believes the wheels are turning following Eddie Howe’s press conference. Although Howe attempted to play a straight bat, he suggested Isak’s determination never to play for Newcastle again dictated that it may be the right moment for a richly talented player he had initially hoped to keep to exit Tyneside. For some context, Aston Villa are favourites with the bookies to win the Europa League following today’s draw. 6/1 Aston Villa, 9/1 Roma, 10/1 Betis, Bologna, Porto, 11/1 Nottingham Forest, 14/1 Celta Vigo, Lyon. Celtic are 25/1, with Rangers 66/1. That’s it from Monaco. The draws are complete. We’ll have a full story soon. By the way, here’s how the Champions League draw panned out if you missed it yesterday. And, as for Aberdeen, their opponents include French side Strasbourg. Aberdeen fixtures: Shakhtar Donetsk (H), Sparta Prague (A), Strasbourg (H), AEK Athens (A), FC Noah (H), AEK Larnaca (A) A variety of Conference League opponents for Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace fixtures: AZ Alkmaar (H), Dynamo Kyiv (A), KuPS Kuopio (H), Strasbourg (A), AEK Larnaca (H), Shelbourne (A) TNT broadcaster Matt Smith is also helping with the draw. I saw him in M&amp;S in Handforth (near Manchester) the other day although he’s not mentioned it so far. Coming up next, the draw for the Conference League. They’ve managed to rope Eden Hazard in for this one. Hopefully he’ll go down better than the magician. Crystal Palace and Aberdeen are the British teams involved. Let’s pull that together and list the fixtures for the four British teams in the Europa League. Aston Villa: RB Salzburg (H), Feyenoord (A), Maccabi Tel Aviv (H), Fenerbahce (A), Young Boys (H), Basel (A), Bologna (H), Go Ahead Eagles (A) Nottingham Forest: Porto (H), Real Betis (A), Ferencvaros (H), Braga (A), Midtjylland (H), Sturn Graz (A), Malmo (H), Utrecht (A) Celtic: Roma (H), Feyenoord (A), Braga (H), Red Star Belgrade (A), Stum Graz (H), FC Midjylland (A), Utrecht (H), Bologna (A) Rangers: Roma (H), Porto (A), Braga (H), Ferencvaros (A), Ludogorets (H), Sturm Graz (A), Genk (H), Brann (A) Nottingham Forest have a repeat of their 1979 European Cup final after being drawn with Malmo in the Europa League. There’s unlikely to be a little concrete shot putt circle near the goal this time. Nottingham Forest fixtures: Porto (H), Real Betis (A), Ferencvaros (H), Braga (A), Midtjylland (H), Sturn Graz (A), Malmo (H), Utrecht (A) Celtic will be kicking themselves that they didn’t make it through to the Champions League. This is their task in the Europa League. Celtic fixtures: Roma (H), Feyenoord (A), Braga (H), Red Star Belgrade (A), Stum Graz (H), FC Midjylland (A), Utrecht (H), Bologna (A) Aston Villa look to have been given a fairly favourable Europa League draw. Here it is. Aston Villa fixtures: RB Salzburg (H), Feyenoord (A), Maccabi Tel Aviv (H), Fenerbahce (A), Young Boys (H), Basel (A), Bologna (H), Go Ahead Eagles (A) Rangers got thumped 6-0 by Club Brugge on Wednesday so it’s perhaps more appropriate for them to be in the Europa League. Here are their opponents. Will Russell Martin be in charge for any or all of them? Rangers fixtures: Roma (H), Porto (A), Braga (H), Ferencvaros (A), Ludogorets (H), Sturm Graz (A), Genk (H), Brann (A) Time now for the Europa League and Conference League draws. We had a brief appearance on stage from a magician but he’s left again after making the balls disappear. Didn’t really work that to be honest. Lacked the gravitas of Paul Daniels and the crowd knew it. It’s also worth pointing out that injury has ruled out several big names from the England squad. Tuchel didn’t have the option of picking Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer or Levi Colwill as all four are sidelined for various lengths of time. Here’s David Hytner with the story on Thomas Tuchel’s England squad announcement. David also notes that Tuchel has not found space for Curtis Jones or Conor Gallagher. Just had to scroll back to make sure I hadn’t written Des rather than Kyle Walker had been left out. Perhaps the call-up for Elliott Anderson has sparked some sort of Forest memory in me. Des is now 59 by the way. He could probably still do a job. Thoughts on Anderson? Elliott not Viv. Reaction to Tuchel’s squad? Out of sight = out of mind? Well, perhaps that applies to Trent but Marcus Rashford is in so maybe not. Here’s the full England squad to play Andorra and Serbia. No Jack Grealish either, you’ll note. Goalkeepers: Pickford, Henderson, Trafford. Defenders: Burn, Guehi, James, Konsa, Lewis-Skelly, Livramento, Spence, Stones. Midfielders: Anderson, Gibbs-White, Henderson, Rice, Rogers, Wharton. Forwards: Bowen, Eze, Gordon, Kane, Madueke, Rashford, Watkins. Breaking news. Some top lines from Tommy Tuchel’s England squad. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Phil Foden and Kyle Walker are all out. Elliott Anderson and Djed Spence are in. Full squad to follow… It’s Thomas Tuchel’s birthday today. He’s 52. Amazingly, sort of, it’s also many happy returns to Scotland manager, Steve Clarke (62). Is this a well-known fact, the bosses of England and Scotland sharing the same birthday? One for The Knowledge maybe. Also note that Lenny Henry and Michael Jackson were also born on this day. The link? Lenny namedropping Aston Villa in his ‘Thriller’ sketch. Thanks very much Yara. As we wait for that, Tom Garry has been getting his chat on with England goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse. Take a read. That is all from me today but Dave Tindall is here to lead you through the afternoon news including Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for the international break which will be announced in 15 minutes. Arsenal are in advanced talks with Bayer Leverkusen over an agreement to sign Piero Hincapié on an initial loan, with the Ecuador defender’s potential arrival expected to allow Jakub Kiwior to join Porto on similar terms. It is understood that Arsenal officials are due to meet their counterparts from Leverkusen on Friday to continue discussions on a deal that includes an obligation for Hincapié to make the move permanent at the end of next season. Having already signed seven players this summer for around £250m, Arsenal are believed to be looking to include the fee for him in next year’s accounts so they don’t fall foul of Uefa’s regulations on financial fair play. The 23-year-old, who is capable of playing as a left-sided centre‑back or left-back, has a release clause of €60m (£52m), although they are not willing to go that high and hope to strike a deal for around €50m (£43.3m). Hincapie is believed to have already told Leverkusen of his desire to move to north London. Porto have agreed a loan deal for Kiwior with an obligation to buy for up to €27m (£23.4m) but Arsenal have been waiting to see if they can make progress on the Hincapie deal before allowing him to depart. They also have interest from Crystal Palace and Fulham in forward Reiss Nelson, while Stuttgart could step up their efforts to sign Portugal midfielder Fabio Vieira before the end of the window. Wayne Rooney believes Ruben Amorim’s comments after Manchester United’s shock Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby on Wednesday night show “something is broken” at the club. United came from 2-0 down to force a penalty shootout at Blundell Park thanks to Harry Maguire’s late goal, but then lost 12-11 on spot-kicks as summer signing Bryan Mbeumo hit the crossbar with the decisive kick. A dejected Amorim, who had not watched the shootout but preferred to sit in the dugout, said after the game: “I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want.” After United finished a lowly 15th last season, their worst finish since 1974, there had been high hopes that a full pre-season for Amorim and £200m worth of new attacking talent could lead to a turnaround this term. But United have begun with a home loss to Arsenal, a draw away to Fulham and a chastening defeat to fourth-tier opposition that has prompted speculation about Amorim’s position just three games into the campaign. Speaking on the BBC’s The Wayne Rooney Show, the former United forward said: Just the way they lost, it was disheartening. There’s something not right. I think that’s clear. I think the manager said that after the game and I think that’s clear for everyone to see that there’s something not right there. It can happen. We lost to Crawley years back in the Cup. But the difference is, everyone looking at that game, they know it’s a one-off. So the issue now is we’re seeing very similar performances, similar results and even though it’s only three games into the season, it’s getting to a point now where you’re like … what is going on? The biggest concern is the manager saying that, his words after the game were damning on the players and obviously being in a position where I’ve been in that dressing room, if your manager comes out with those words, there’s something broken. Rooney suggested that Amorim, who took charge in November after the dismissal of Erik ten Hag, could be struggling to adapt to life at one of the biggest football clubs in the world after arriving from Sporting Lisbon. I think what we forget, he’s 40. He’s a young manager. And Manchester United is so different to where he’s been before. And you come in, there’s the media team, the commercial team, the fans, the media. It’s completely different. And there’s a pressure with Manchester United which he will never have felt before. PA Media It will be a huge opportunity for Anderson to impress in the senior set up. What are your thoughts? Any one else you want to see Tuchel name in his squad? Let me know your thoughts via email, which you can find at the top of this blog. We will be bringing you the full squad as it is announced live at midday. Thomas Tuchel’s priority will be to fine-tune his existing options in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. But he wants a look at Anderson, who starred as Lee Carsley’s under-21s won the European Championship in the summer. Thomas Tuchel will announce his latest England squad this afternoon and Elliot Anderson is expected to receive his first senior call-up. The Nottingham Forest midfielder was outstanding as England retained the Under-21 European Championship in Slovakia earlier this summer and the 22-year-old has evolved into a key performer for his club. Newcastle reluctantly sold Anderson to Forest last year to help them comply with profitability and sustainability regulations. He excelled on loan at Bristol Rovers in the second half of 2021-22, scoring the decisive goal in a 7-0 final-day win that clinched an unthinkable promotion to the third tier. Anderson’s Forest teammate Morgan Gibbs-White returned to the senior squad in June. David Moyes was asked about incoming transfers at Everton and whether this has been one of his hardest summers taking charge at a club. Here is what he had to say: I think it has. Since we beat Newcastle on the last game of the season I have been working on recruitment and found it a really difficult summer. We have had a lot of players who have chosen not to come and we have had to work really hard to get enough players in. Our squad numbers are small. But if things change before Monday then that would be good. But it is not all doom and gloom for Moyes, who is incredibly excited about what Jack Grealish can bring to his side this season: I’m really pleased because he is a real talent and someone we hope we can get back to the levels he has produced over many years. I hope he can build on it, continue get fitter and continue to keep playing regularly. West Ham have confirmed the signing of Mateus Fernandes from Southampton with a deal worth £38m plus £4m in add-ons. I’m very happy to be here. I’m very excited to play for West Ham. I think it’s a big step for me. It’s a big club, a massive club. The project, the stadium, the city, everything. I want to try to play football, enjoy football, not just run and try to score, but try to play good football. I think the most important thing is to try to give everything every day. The Rumour Mill continues to spin away. Dominic Booth has the latest on the latest whispers in the transfer universe. And of course, Howe is asked if Isak will remain a Newcastle player by the end of the window: It’s difficult for me to give you any sort of clarity on the future. I’ve said before, I don’t know what the future holds in that respect because I’m not involved with it myself. I’ve got no update and I’m just concentrating on bringing players into the club. The Newcastle manager was also asked about their Champions League draw. Howe’s side will be playing: Barcelona (home), Paris Saint-Germain (away), Benfica (home), Bayer Leverkusen (away), PSV Eindhoven (home), Marseille (away), Athletic Bilbao (home) and Union SG (away). Really interesting. Some great games. Exciting prospects. The group we had last time was very difficult, the games we have this time are tough and challenging. The Barcelona game is the one you instantly get drawn to, with the links with Sir Bobby and the history between the two clubs. Can we create more legacy to that fixture? Eddie Howe has naturally been asked about Nick Woltemade after reports that the German has flown into Tyneside for a medical ahead of his £70m move from Stuttgart: Positive signs. Things are moving and developing in a good way at the moment. Until it’s done I can’t confirm anything but fingers crossed. I don’t think that is going to be possible [for Woltemade to play against Leeds tomorrow] due to lots of reasons I don’t understand. The most important thing is we try to bring a centre-forward in that’s what we’ve been working hard to do all summer. Slot was also asked about Hugo Ekitike, Liverpool’s new striker, who has stormed to a strong start with two goals in two matches: He’s already made a big impact on the attacking part of our game so not only scoring goals but being part of buildup situations where he was someone that started the attack. The most important answer to what he can improve is his match fitness. I expect him to do a lot more without the ball than he already does because he’s already working hard. It’s completely normal because he has to adjust to a different league from a different playing style. Frankfurt wasn’t pressing as much as we try to do, and then coming to a different league, there’s a lot for him to handle. To adapt to the intensity levels without the ball, there are small steps to make for him. Despite two wins from two, Liverpool have struggled with set-pieces and will face a team on Sunday that thrive from dead-ball situations: The thing that stands out for [Arsenal], and in a negative way for us, is we’ve conceded four set pieces, including the Bilbao game and that’s one of their strengths. You can see how well they are managed by Mikel Arteta, they’ve been working together for five years and they can play almost every style there is. It [conceding from set-pieces] is a part we need to improve, which we were really good at last season so there’s no panic. Liverpool’s title defence continues on Sunday and Arne Slot was, of course, asked about Alexander Isak, who is doing his best to force a move to the defending champions from Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side have spent most of the summer trying to sign a new striker to replace Callum Wilson and Isak, if they let him leave. After missing out on several targets, they finally seemed to have found their man in Nick Woltemade. Here is what Arne Slot said on the situation: If it’s true, Newcastle have signed a new No9 and that’s very nice for Eddie because Anthony Gordon is suspended and Isak has not been training. I said after Monday evening that I could make a substitute to impact the game and as always, we try to sign players who can help us. But there’s no reason, after the first two games to complain to think we need more. But if we can strength the squad, we will try to do that if it’s for the right money and the right player. Let’s see if we do something and if we can, what we can do. Slot’s side will host Arsenal at Anfield, their closest rivals to the title last season: There are a lot of similarities with both teams. The playing style of Arsenal hasn’t changed too much with the new signings coming in. Maybe they have a different No 9 than last season, Jesus is a real No 9 but he didn’t play as much, but the one they have now is different to Havertz or Trossard. Gyokeres is more of a target man so that’s maybe where there’s a small difference. Tottenham are poised to complete the £51.8m signing of Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig. Personal terms have been agreed with the attacking midfielder and a medical has taken place. Barring any last-minute hitches the deal will be a major boost for Thomas Frank, who has been hoping to add an attacking midfielder. Spurs have have missed out on Eberechi Eze, who joined Arsenal from Crystal Palace, and Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. Chelsea were also interested in Simons but never made a bid for the 22-year-old. There are no indications that the club will disrupt their London rivals by attempting a late swoop for the Netherlands international. More from Jacob Steinberg and David Hytner here. Mourinho joined Fenerbahce just over a year ago after a stint at Roma and was greeted by thousands of fans when he arrived in Istanbul, raising expectations of ending Galatasaray’s recent dominance. He was in charge for 62 matches at Fenerbahce where he won 37, lost 11 and drew 14, making his win percentage 59.68%, his highest since his time at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013 (71.91%). Fenerbahce have parted ways with José Mourinho after the Turkish club failed to qualify for the Champions League league phase. Mourinho’s side were beaten 1-0 by Benfica on Wednesday night in their playoff tie. In a statement released on social media, the club said: “We thank him for his efforts for our team until today and wish him success in his future career.” The former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham manager is the second high-profile manager in Turkey to get the sack in the last day after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas less than one hour after they failed to qualify for the Conference League. It is Friday morning and yet another weekend of Premier League football awaits, this one the last before the first international break of the season. Here you will find all the latest lines as the managers take on the media in today’s press conferences. Deadline day is also fast approaching and clubs will be hoping to make those late adjustments to their squad to ensure they are as ready as possible for the long season ahead. We will also have of EFL, Scottish Premiership and European football news as it comes. Plus the latest on Thomas Tuchel’s England squad announcement for World Cup qualifiers at noon.

32) Trump will have been ‘played’ if Putin avoids Zelenskyy meeting, warns Macron – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     … and on that note, it’s a wrap! European leaders have accused Vladimir Putin of undermining peace talks, after Russian missile strikes on Kyiv this week killed at least 23 people and damaged diplomatic buildings, including EU and British Council offices (9:38, 9:51, 14:00). EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas accused Russia of disregard for international law and of undermining peace efforts. Her statement was endorsed by all EU member states except Hungary, which is led by Putin’s ally Viktor Orbán (15:10, 15:30, 15:36, 15:43). French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz also condemned Russia’s attacks and delay tactics (16:52, 16:56), as they pledged to provide more air defence to Ukraine (15:53) and push for peace talks to advance or Russia face more sanctions. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that allies should consider Monday to be the deadline for Russia to agree to bilateral meeting on ending war and call for “a response” if it misses the date (14:05). Separately, he also warned that Russia was massing 100,000 troops near east Ukraine stronghold of Pokrovsk, warning of potential “offensive actions” (15:13). Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, also warned the US special envoy Steve Witkoff that Russia was “obviously prolonging hostilities,” as the pair met in New York (17:28). Sweden joined the EU (17:44) and the UK (17:56) in summoning the Russian ambassador to “protest against Russia’s continued attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians” (11:51). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa. Defence and security editor Colm McGivern, the director of the British Council in Ukraine, said a security guard had been injured and the cultural organisation’s headquarters had been “rendered unusable” by damage from Thursday’s Russian air strikes on Kyiv. No evidence has emerged to suggest the council was deliberately targeted by Moscow, though McGivern said “what I do know is that Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”. A neighbouring building in the city centure was struck at 5.40am and the ensuing blast wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows, destroyed its ceilings and left its computers non functional, the director said. Such was the damage that a security guard, on night watch was injured and hospitalised. The guard had to have an operation, and McGivern said “thankfully he is going to be okay”. No other employees were on the site at the time. McGivern said that the 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had resolved to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities despite the loss of the premises for the foreseeable future, including supporting the Kyiv International Short Film Festival next week. “It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. “There is a palpable level of anger and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can, to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK”. in Brussels Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin has asked the European Commission for more details about its summoning of the Russian charges d’affaires yesterday, after a Russian strike in Kyiv hit the EU delegation building and the British Council offices, among others. EU spokesperson for foreign affairs Anitta Hipper said: “The European External Action Service under the leadership of the HR/VP has summoned the Chargé d’Affaires of the Russian mission to the European Union, Karen Malayan yesterday. Clear messages have been passed. Firstly, Russian reckless attacks resulted in the death of at least 23 people, including 4 children. Secondly, on the fact that the damages to the EU Delegations are serious and constitute a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Inviolability of diplomatic premises and personnel is to be respected in all cases. And thirdly, the EU will not stop to support Ukraine. Russia must stop killing and negotiate.” Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, met with US peace envoy Steve Witkoff in New York. Yermak said the meeting, which he attended together with Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs Serhii Kyslytsia, was intended to “push for real diplomacy and the implementation of all agreements of the Washington summit.” He said that the Ukrainian delegation told Witkoff about “all the war crimes that Russia commits daily against our cities and communities,” including Thursday’s attack on Kyiv, which killed 23 people. “Unfortunately, Russia is not doing anything necessary to end the war and is obviously prolonging the hostilities,” he warned. He told Witkoff that Ukraine is “open to direct talks at the leadership level,” ramping up further pressure on making the bi- or trilateral summit with Zelenskyy, Putin and potentially Trump happen in near future. Yermak also said he invited Witkoff to visit Ukraine “in the near future.” Given the domestic political context in France, with François Bayrou’s government widely expected to collapse next month, Macron’s comments that he intends to serve out the rest of his term are also making headlines. The president told reporters that he had a long discussion with Bayrou about his plan, and appeared to back his plan for a crunch vote in parliament, saying the situation required a principled discussion about key issues. Asked about his future, he insisted that “the mandate which has been given to me by the French people, and by no-one else, is a mandate that will be carried out through to the end of its term.” And that ends their press conference. Separately, chancellor Merz also pushed back against US president Donald Trump’s questioning the EU’s digital regulations, stressing it was an expression of the bloc’s sovereignty. “We are doing this in our own interest and solely for our own interest, and we will certainly not be guided by statements that perhaps consider completely different, perhaps even no, regulation necessary and important,” he said. Germany’s Merz warned in turn that the war could go on for “many months” as he questioned Vladimir Putin’s commitments to progress the peace talks. He pointed out that the original discussion focused on hosting a bilateral summit between Putin and Zelenskyy within two weeks, and yet the Russian president remained “clearly unwilling” to follow through on this plan. “Frankly, this doesn’t surprise me, because it’s part of the Russian president’s strategy to proceed in the same way,” he said. Instead, he stressed the importance of working together within the Coalition of the Willing and putting even more pressure on Russia to come to the table. During the press conference, Macron also reiterated that a just and lasting peace is only possible if Ukraine gets strong security guarantees. He added that they both hoped that Russia’s Putin would move ahead with the bi- or trilateral meeting on ending the war, as committed to in conversations with president Trump. But Macron warned that if Putin was to miss the Monday deadline, it would have been another example of him trying to “play” Trump, which he said could not go unanswered, and should prompt further sanctions. He indicated that both him and Merz could speak with Trump over the weekend. Speaking at a joint press conference just now, Emmanuel Macron also stressed the need for the two countries to work together on industrial and digital policies, saying they would improve their digital sovereignty and competitiveness in “cutting-edge technologies.” The president also said they were determined to preserve the EU’s legislation on digital, which can be seen as an indirect response to US president Donald Trump’s repeated comments expressing his frustration with the bloc’s rulebooks, which he sees as discriminating American technology. He also signalled France and Germany would work together more closely on other issues, including the future of the automotive industry, steel, climate policies, and migration. We are also getting first news lines from Toulon, where French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz attended the 25th Franco-German Council of Ministers. A joint statement from the meeting includes a commitment to start what is called as “strategic dialogue” over nuclear deterrence and more broadly linking the two countries’ security policies, agencies reported. Importantly for Kyiv, it is also reported to include a pledge to provide more air defence systems to Ukraine, adding that “despite intensive international diplomatic efforts, Russia shows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine”. Kallas also gets asked if there is a way to unblock the €6.6bn in the European Peace Facility and use it for purchases helping Ukraine under the new Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List scheme agreed with Nato and US president Donald Trump. She says there has been various attempts to convince Hungary to unblock the budget, including potential “opt outs” or guarantees the money would not be used on lethal aid, but she concedes these “have not been effective so far.” She notes that Hungary often praises US president Trump’s peace efforts, and unblocking this money could help to advance them. Speaking alongside Kallas, Danish deputy prime minister and defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen stresses the need to provide Ukraine with the support it needs. He says: “This is indeed an important time for Europe’s security, and we have also discussed this during our meeting today, a central topic for today’s meeting was the EU’s military support to Ukraine. The task is very clear. Ukraine needs more military support, and they need it right now. We do not have time on our side, and the costs if we are not acting now will be much more substantial in the longer term. We simply don’t have a choice.” Reporting after ministerial talks on Ukraine, Kallas says “it is clear that Europe will fully play its part.” She says the EU ministers showed “a broad support” to “expand our EU military mission mandate to provide training and advice inside Ukraine after any truce.” She says the EU is already the largest training provider for Ukraine’s military, but it “must be ready to do more,” with EU trainers in Ukraine’s military academies and institutions and working on building Ukraine’s civilian resilience against Russian hybrid attacks. She also touches upon the need to provide Ukraine with new security guarantees. She says: “Going forward, we will closely coordinate with the Coalition of the Willing. Ministers were clear that the security guarantees for Ukraine must be robust and credible. 2022 must not be allowed to repeat.” EU’s foreign policy chief Kallas is speaking in Copenhagen now. “The past weeks, we have seen diplomatic efforts to end Russia’s war, and it’s clear that Europe wants peace, America wants peace, Ukraine wants peace. Who doesn’t want peace is Russia.” She says Russian attacks on Kyiv showed it was a “deliberate choice” to “escalate and mock the peace efforts.” Her comments will be closely watched as they come shortly after Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that Russia was building up a force of some 100,000 troops near the eastern Ukrainian stronghold of Pokrovsk, which Russia claims as its territory, AFP reported. “There is a build-up and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions in any case,” Zelensky told journalists. We should hear from Kallas herself shortly – her press briefing is expected to start in the next few minutes. I will bring you all the key lines here. 26 member states of the EU have signed a new statement issued by the EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, condemning the Russian attack on Kyiv on Thursday, calling out “the reckless nature of Russia’s attacks and its disregard for international law.” The group – which includes all EU members states except for Hungary, which regularly refuses to back statements critical of Russia – stressed that “intentional attacks against civilians and non-military objectives are war crimes,” and warned that “all commanders, perpetrators and accomplices of these grave violations of international humanitarian law shall be held to account. “These crimes only reinforce our determination and resolve to support Ukraine and its people in their defence against Russia and their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,” the statement said, promising to “continue and increase” support for Ukraine and “accelerate” the work on new sanctions against Russia. Russia must stop the killing and show genuine willingness for peace. Separately, Ukraine’s top general Oleksandr Syrskyi just said he spoke with his counterparts from member countries of the so-called “Coalition of the Willing” about steps that could help secure a just and lasting peace in the war with Russia, Reuters reported. “Jointly developed practical solutions, supported by real mechanisms of political and diplomatic support from reliable partners of Ukraine, are capable of ensuring a just and lasting peace for Ukraine and all of Europe,” he said. During a meeting with reporters, Zelenskyy said that discussions by Kyiv’s partners on security guarantees for Ukraine should be “urgently” elevated to a leaders’ level, and that US president Donald Trump should take part, Reuters reported. He said he expected to continue discussions with European leaders next week on what he described as Nato-like commitments. “We need the architecture to be clear to everyone,” he said. “Then we want to connect with President Trump during a meeting... and tell him how we see it.“ Zelenskiy added that he would also like to see allies ratify any security guarantees through their respective parliaments. “We want legally binding security guarantees. We don’t want (another) Budapest Memorandum,” he said, referring to a 1994 deal in which Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security assurances. We are getting some news lines from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, via Reuters. He is quoted as saying that Ukraine and its allies have agreed to wait until 1 September for Russia to show genuine willingness and readiness to take part in a bilateral meting on ending the invasion of Ukraine. But he said that he expected a response from partners if Russia fails to move by this deadline. Zelenskyy also argued in favour of moving talks on security guarantees to a more senior level of national leaders. I will bring you full quotes when we get them. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is in Latvia today, and has been speaking to the media in the last few minutes. Speaking alongside Latvia’s prime minister Evika Siliņa, she praised the country’s work on becoming “a true drone and anti drone powerhouse” in Europe, contributing to Nato’s security in the region bordering with Russia. We know that Europe is only safe if the eastern border is safe. She added: “The risks your country and the other Baltic States warned us about, unfortunately, have materialised. Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine is now in its fourth year, Putin is a predator, Putin’s proxies have been targeting our societies for years with hybrid attacks, with cyber-attacks, [and] the weaponising of migrants is another example.” Von der Leyen also revealed that the EU has reached “full subscription” of the EU’s €150bn SAFE mechanism for joint procurement as part of its broader effort to step up defence production. The commission president, and former German defence minister under Angela Merkel, stressed that “the whole of the European Union needs to understand that it is important to work on readiness, immediate readiness” to respond to growing risks and threats. She spoke that this included the importance of financial flexibility for EU member states “to invest in their own defence,” and the need to look into more joint procurement across Europe. Von der Leyen also said that “in parallel” the EU needed to work on strengthening the Ukrainian armed forces to turn them into “like a steel porcupine, undigestible for potential invaders.” Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said that it was his understanding that Russia would be willing to freeze the conflict in the south of Ukraine along current front lines if it is given all of the Donbas region. In comments reported by the AFP, Hakan argued that Russia has moved on from its original demands. “There is currently a preliminary (agreement) regarding the return of 25-30 percent of Donetsk and maintaining the contact line in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson,” Fidan said in an interview with TGRT Haber on Thursday. It was not clear who that agreement was between, AFP noted. Asked about Fidan’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was “deliberately not disclosing all the details of the conversation between the two presidents in Alaska” as doing so would hinder the peace process. The Ukrainian military said it had carried out an overnight strike on a facility in Russia’s Bryansk region responsible for pumping diesel fuel for Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine, Reuters reported. In a statement, Kyiv’s General Staff said the station in the village of Naitopovichi has a pumping capacity of around 10.5m tonnes per year, and that the strike had caused a fire. After the EU and the UK, Sweden has now also summoned the Russian ambassador to “protest against Russia’s continued attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians.” Sweden wanted to “emphasise Russia’s obligation to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in accordance with international humanitarian law,” a statement on the foreign ministry’s website said. Meanwhile, Russia has appeared to reject the European proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine, claiming they would increase the risk of a military conflict and turn Ukraine into a “strategic provocateur” on Russia’s border, Reuters reported. Chief executive of the British Council On Wednesday night, our office in Kyiv was damaged in a Russian missile attack. It was a stark reminder of the risks that an organisation such as ours faces in conflict-affected areas. I was relieved to hear that all colleagues were safe and accounted for. One colleague was injured and admitted to hospital but thankfully he is in a stable condition. Working under such conditions around the world is challenging, and yet, time and again, our colleagues and partners demonstrate courage and commitment in carrying on despite the dangers. Their resilience is extraordinary. We are working to find ways to minimise disruption and continuing to support our team there. … My colleagues work in the most complex and often dangerous places, whether in Myanmar, Iraq, the occupied Palestinian territories, Venezuela or Bangladesh. And they don’t give up when the going gets tough. If we are absolutely forced to withdraw from a region, we return as soon as possible. This means that our history has not been without tragedy. In 1971, guards were killed protecting our office in Dhaka during Bangladesh’s liberation war. More lives were lost during the Taliban attack on our office in Kabul in 2011. There have been shootings, arrests and detentions. We will always be grateful to the people who have stood with us against those who will go to the most violent ends to disrupt our work. Over the past 90 years there have been periods of friction, war and conflict and some of relative peace. I fear the years ahead hold significant challenge. But that is when the British Council needs to deliver more than ever. This war has damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure, putting the right to education of millions of young people at stake. The British government recently committed to a 100-year partnership with Ukraine, signifying the breadth and depth of relationships between our countries. The work of the British Council is more important than ever – it will continue throughout the war, office or no office. in Kyiv Photographs by Julia Kochetova At a five-storey residential apartment block in the Darnytskyi area in the east of the city, residents said they had heard Russian bombing in the distance. It was a familiar sound, and many had gathered away from the windows in central corridors that extended along the block, only for disaster to strike. “We didn’t understand what had happened,” said Oleksandr Yastremskyi, who had taken refuge in a corridor with his wife, Tetiana, and their son Denys. “It’s like something had landed into our house. And then we heard people screaming.” A hundred metres away, the other end of their building collapsed, sending, according to Tetiana, “a big wave of dust and smoke” in their direction. Ivan Zhelezko, a serving soldier, looked across at his bombed second-floor flat, its balcony hanging at an unsustainable angle. Around him in bags were a handful of possessions he had managed to take with him from the apartment where he lived with his family for 20 years. Zhelezko said he was too stunned to be angry, describing himself as confused. Among those who died, he said, were his friend’s sister and the parents of a childhood friend. The soldier explained that his family escaped because they left immediately after the first explosion, and he tried to insist the tragedy was “nothing new for me”. Such fatalism was hard to believe, though he added: “I’m just happy my family is alive.” Those who moved fast or were simply at the other end of the building may have been able to escape unhurt but, such was the ferocity of the blasts, taking down all five storeys, they could only have been caused by a cruise or ballistic missile attack, giving those in the path of the rockets no chance. Given the meeting is held in Copenhagen, as Denmark holds the rotating EU presidency at the moment, some ministers get asked about the recent allegations of US influence operations in relation to Greenland. Ireland’s Harris declared his full support for Denmark in response, saying: “Ireland fully supports and stands with the people of Denmark and the Danish government in relation to Greenland. I think it’s important that every country in the European Union stands with Denmark in relation to this matter.” We are getting first lines from Copenhagen, where EU defence ministers are meeting this morning. Ireland’s Simon Harris joined the growing chorus of those calling for a stronger reaction, including further sanctions. He said: “I’m absolutely appalled by the actions of Russia in terms of the attack on Kyiv and indeed the attack on the European delegation office there. This cannot be a consequence free zone. I think it’s very important that the entire world speaks with one voice in its absolute condemnation of Russia’s clear breach of the Vienna Convention. What’s also clear is that while the world is talking about peace, and how do we bring about peace and dialogue and diplomacy to end the war on Ukraine, it’s quite clear that Russia is continuing to engage in the actions of terror, attacking a civilian population, showing no willingness for a ceasefire, and therefore, I think it’s imperative that those of us in the European Union now consider further sanctions.” Earlier, Estonia’s defence minister Hanno Pevkur argued that the best security guarantee for Ukraine would be membership in Nato. Lithuanian minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, called for secondary sanctions on Russia and its partners, arguing it would be the most efficient way to stop funding the Russian war machine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that at least 23 people were killed in yesterday’s Russian attacks on Kyiv, including 22 people on a single site in the city’s Darnytskyi district. More than 50 people were injured, and 8 people are still missing. On Friday morning, Zelenskyy reiterated his call for Russia to be held accountable for these strikes. He said: “When instead of diplomacy Russia chooses ballistics, continues to modernize ‘shaheds’ for killing, and deepens cooperation with actors like North Korea, it means the world must respond accordingly. Strong sanctions, strong pressure, strong steps are needed so that the murderers do not feel impunity.” EU defence ministers are meeting in Copenhagen today to discuss what else the bloc could do when it comes to both pressure on Russia to bring it to the negotiating table, and support and security guarantees for Ukraine. Arriving for the meeting this morning, EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: “These attacks show that Putin is just mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made. So what we have to do is increase pressure on Russia.” Expect that to be a recurring theme in the ministers’ comments throughout the day. We will also hear from the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, as she is touring member states on the eastern flank, and from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as they are meeting for a Franco-German summit in Toulon. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Friday, 29 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.

     Tottenham have completed the £51.8m signing of Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig. The deal is a major boost for Thomas Frank, who has been looking to add an attacking midfielder. Spurs have lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury and have missed out on Eberechi Eze, who joined Arsenal from Crystal Palace, and Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White, who signed a new contract. Chelsea were also interested in Simons but never made a bid for the 22-year-old Netherlands international. Chelsea are well stocked in attacking midfield, despite agreeing a £36m deal for Christopher Nkunku to join Milan. They have focused on a £40m deal for the Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and have targets beyond Simons, including Barcelona’s Fermín López. Chelsea have held further talks with Barça over López. Sources have indicated the La Liga club will consider a sale if the 22-year-old asks to leave, but he is likely to cost more than £50m. Spurs were able to take advantage of Chelsea not firming up their interest in Simons. The north London club properly entered the race on Wednesday and moved quickly to agree terms with Leipzig, who are in a hurry to finalise a deal so they can move for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott. Jürgen Klopp, the Red Bull head of global soccer and Elliott’s former manager at Liverpool, is a significant part of that proposed transfer. Chelsea explored offloading a player to Leipzig as part of any deal for Simons but that did not appeal to the Bundesliga club and Simons flew to London on Wednesday to discuss a transfer with Spurs. He contract is expected to run to 2032. “I will bring flair to the team but also hard work and discipline,” Simons told Spurs’ website. Frank said: “Xavi has proven his ability to get goals and assists, both from the No 10 position and left wing. He also has a great eye for his teammates in terms of unlocking defences.” Simons had been clear about his desire to leave this summer. He came through Barcelona’s academy before spells at PSV and Paris Saint-Germain, who sold him to Leipzig last January. In a surprise twist Chelsea have agreed a loan move for the Brighton winger Facundo Buonanotte, who was expected to join Leeds. The deal does not include an option to buy. Brighton are exploring options for a Premier League loan for the Argentina international and have no desire to sell. Wolves are in talks over a deal to sign Tolu Arokodare from Genk. The Nigeria striker scored 17 goals in the Belgian Pro League last season and is understood to be available for between £15m and £20m. Arokodare is open to moving to the Premier League and has emerged as an option for Wolves after their pursuit of Getafe’s Christantus Uche stalled over personal terms. West Ham have completed the £38m signing of Mateus Fernandes from Southampton. The midfielder has joined on a five-year deal and hands Graham Potter a major boost after a dreadful start to the season. West Ham also announced the £17.2m signing of defensive midfielder Soungoutou Magassa from Monaco. Magassa, 21, has signed a deal for an initial four years with an option of an extra two, and his new club highlighted his “strength, versatility and ability to break up play”. Nottingham Forest and Eintracht Frankfurt were interested in Magassa. The France Under-21s international has opted for West Ham, who are expected to fail with an attempt to sign Ibrahim Sangaré on loan. Forest indicated they would let Sangaré go on loan only if West Ham did not sign Magassa. Potter could look to add a third midfielder. West Ham are monitoring Feyernoord’s Quinten Timber, who has been targeted by Bayer Leverkusen. They also want a goalkeeper on loan but have turned down the chance to sign Manchester United’s André Onana. Potter is interested in bringing in a striker. West Ham are open to selling Nayef Aguerd. The Morocco centre-back has interest from Sunderland and Marseille. The Hammers could be interested in Toulouse’s England Under-21 international Charlie Cresswell if they look to strengthen at the back.

34) EU accuses Putin of undermining peace talks after deadly strikes on Kyiv — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     European leaders have accused Vladimir Putin of undermining peace talks, after Russian missile strikes on Kyiv this week killed at least 23 people and damaged diplomatic buildings, including EU and British Council offices. A day of mourning was observed in Kyiv on Friday, after the Russian air attack the day before that killed 23 people, including at least four children. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said eight people were still missing and 53 had been injured. “When instead of diplomacy, Russia chooses ballistics … the world must respond accordingly,” he said, urging western allies to impose further sanctions. Separately, the Ukrainian leader said Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk. “There is a buildup and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions,” Zelenskyy said. Europe’s high representative for foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas, responding to the attacks on Kyiv, issued a statement accusing Russia of disregard for international law and of undermining peace efforts. “Intentional attacks against civilians and non-military objectives are war crimes,” he said. “These crimes only reinforce our determination and resolve to support Ukraine and its people in their defence against Russia and their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.” The statement was endorsed by the UK and all EU member states except Hungary, which is led by Putin’s ally Viktor Orbán, who has long denigrated Ukraine and sought to block EU aid to the country. The latest attacks on the Ukrainian capital were the deadliest since Donald Trump met Putin in Alaska for an inconclusive summit, where he laid out the red carpet for the Russian leader, who has been indicted for war crimes. Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness, the Kremlin has held back. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Putin would have “played” Trump if he refused to meet Zelenskyy. After Macron hosted the German leader, Friedrich Merz, in the south of France, France and Germany pledged to increase air defence to Ukraine. In a joint statement, the key EU countries said: “Despite intensive international diplomatic efforts, Russia shows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine.” Kallas said the latest attacks showed “that Putin is just mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made. So what we have to do is increase pressure on Russia and this is really what they understand.” After the deadly strike in the early hours of Thursday morning, the EU has vowed to introduce a further round of sanctions against Russia – the 19th since the full-scale invasion began in 2022 – increase military aid for Ukraine, and discuss seizing €210bn of Russian assets frozen in the bloc. Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said hopes of peace negotiations were “at least naive” and Putin was “cheaply buying time to kill more people”. She praised efforts to secure peace, saying that “nobody [had] thought of anything better than [what] Washington is doing”. Colm McGivern, the director of the British Council in Ukraine, said Thursday’s airstrikes had injured a security guard and made the cultural organisation’s Kyiv headquarters “unusable”. While there is no evidence the council was deliberately targeted, McGivern said, “what I do know is that Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”. A neighbouring building in the city centre was struck at 5.40am and the blast-wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows, destroyed its ceilings and wrecked its computers, the director said. McGivern said that the 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had vowed to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities. “It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. “There is a palpable level of anger, and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can, to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK.” EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen discussed security guarantees for Ukraine, amid US pressure on European allies to shoulder more responsibility for the security of the continent. Kallas wants to reorganise an EU troop-training mission so Ukrainian soldiers could receive instruction inside Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The EU has said about 80,000 Ukrainian troops have taken part in the training programme since 2022. The latest Russian attacks have intensified calls to use Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin and to help Ukraine in its defence. Šakalienė expressed support for seizing Russia’s frozen assets and giving them to Ukraine, saying they would be “extremely helpful” for Ukraine’s defence industry and “very good motivation for Putin to sit at the negotiations table”. The EU has an agreement to use the windfall profits on Russian assets for Ukraine but has balked at seizing the capital, which is mostly held at Euroclear in Belgium, fearing weakening investor confidence in eurozone financial institutions. EU foreign ministers are to discuss using Russia’s frozen assets at a separate meeting with Kallas on Saturday. After the attacks on Thursday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU was “advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets to contribute to Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction”. A spokesperson later said she was referring to use of the profits, which have generated €9bn in funds for Ukraine in 2025, rather than the assets.

35) UK bank shares fall as City fears budget tax raid; US trade deficit surges – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     And finally… the London stock market has closed, with losses across the UK banking sector. The possibility that Rachel Reeves might bring in new taxes on the sector in this autumn’s budget has sparked a wave of selling. NatWest ended the day as the FTSE 100’s biggest faller, down 4.85%. Lloyds Banking Group (-3.3%) and Barclays (-2.2%) ended in the list of top fallers, along with UK retailers JD Sports (-4%) and Kingfisher (-2.2%). HSBC lost 1%. The falls mean that over £6bn was wiped off the UK banking sector today, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the autumn budget spooked investors. As my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains: Calls for a tax grab, in a paper written by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank, took a toll on some of the UK’s biggest high street banks. The IPPR’s report calls for a new tax on the big banks that would help to recover “windfalls” enjoyed by lenders as a result of an emergency economic policy known as quantitative easing, which was put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. The policy involved the Bank of England buying up £895bn of bonds from the UK’s banks and crediting them with reserves at the Bank. Those reserves subsequently accrued interest at the central bank’s base interest rate: currently at 4%. On that note, goodnight! GW Another tax raising option for Rachel Reeves is to make landlords pay National Insurance on their rental income. It emerged yesterday that the Treasury was considering a tax on landlords that will target income from rents, as part of the autumn budget. YouGov have just release a poll which shows the measure could be popular with voters. Nearly half of those polled said they supported the idea, while just 27% opposed it, and 25% didn’t know. Donald Trump’s elimination of the de minimis shipping exemption that allowed low-value packages to arrive to the US without trade duties is likely to hurt many UK businesses. The Institute of Directors has found that roughly 30% of its members that export to the US are expecting some impact from the US decision to remove the de minimis threshold, which came into effect today. Previously, most exports under $800 entered the US duty-free under a simplified process, but Trump has now closed this option. Emma Rowland, trade policy advisor at the Institute of Directors, said: “The additional tariff charge, customs documentation and data requirements at the border only compound the administrative burden for firms already grappling with an uncertain exporting landscape. This is a move that will predominantly impact smaller firms which do not necessarily have the resources to assume extra complexity in their international business. The former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is set to join Keir Starmer’s team as chief economic adviser. In a boost to the prime minister’s office in the run-up to the autumn budget, Lady Shafik is expected to take on the role after a year heading a Foreign Office review of the government’s foreign aid spending. A member of the House of Lords, Shafik resigned last year as the president of Columbia University after criticism of the treatment of Jewish students during anti-Isreal protests at the institution’s New York campus. Shafik was previously head of the London School of Economics, a deputy governor of the International Monetary Fund and the top civil servant at the Foreign Office. In 2019 she was touted as a possible contender to replace Mark Carney as the Bank of England’s governor. Another blow to the White House: US consumer confidence took a dive last month. The University of Michigan has reported that its Index of Consumer Sentiment fell by 5.7% this month, to 58.2 points, down from 61.7 in July. Consumers become gloomier about current economic conditions, and the outlook for the economy. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says: ﻿Consumer sentiment confirmed its early-month reading, moving down about 6% from July. Sentiment now stands about 11% above readings from April and May but remains at least 10% below 6 and 12 months ago. This month’s decrease was visible across groups by age, income, and stock wealth. Moreover, perceptions of many aspects of the economy slipped. Buying conditions for durable goods subsided to their lowest reading in a year, and current personal finances declined 7%, both due to heightened concerns about high prices. Expectations for business conditions and labor markets contracted in August as well. That said, expectations for personal finances held steady this month, albeit at relatively subdued levels relative to a year ago Back in the US, a key measure of inflation has risen. US PCE core inflation, seen as the Federal Reserve’s favourite inflation measure, has risen to 2.9% in July on an annual basis, up from 2.8% in June. Canada’s economy has been dragged to the brink of recession by Donald Trump’s trade war, in an headache for prime minister Mark Carney. Real gross domestic product (GDP) across Canada declined by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2025, the country’s statistics office has reported, following a 0.5% gain in the first quarter. Statistics Canada explains: The contraction in the second quarter was driven by significant declines in the export of goods, as well as decreased business investment in machinery and equipment. These declines were tempered by faster accumulations of business inventories, higher household spending and lower imports of goods. Canada has been sparring with the Trump White House for months; in March, Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to new tariffs on steel and aluminum. Last week, Carney said some countertariffs would be dropped, as Ottawa tried to end the trade war. Newsflash: America’s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened sharply last month, as more goods poured into the US. The US international trade deficit rose by 22% in July to $103.6bn in July, new data from the US Census Bureau shows. That’s an increase of $18.7bn compared with June’s deficit of $84.9bn. The increase was due to a surge of imports into the US last month. That could be due to companies trying to front-run the latest tariffs from Donald Trump, which kicked in at the start of August. Imports of goods in July rose to $281.5bn, $18.6bn more than in June. Exports of goods for July were $178.0bn, $100m less than June exports. Bank lobby group UK Finance (unsurprisingly) oppose another tax on the sector, saying: “Banks based here already pay both a corporation tax surcharge and a bank levy. “Adding another tax would make the UK less internationally competitive and run counter to the government’s aim of supporting the financial services sector.” UK house sales rose last month as activity continued its recovery following the end of the stamp duty holiday. Official figures from HM Revenue and Customs showed property transaction rose 1% month-on-month in July. It said there were 95,580 property sales last month, a 4% increase against July last year, following an increase in June. This recovery followed a notable drop in house sales after changes to the stamp duty threshold at the start of April. The Serious Fraud Office has admitted today that the convictions of five former traders for interest rate rigging may be unsafe. Following the Supreme Court decision to overturn the conviction of two traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo last month, the SFO has looked at other cases involving the rigging of the Libor and Euribor rates. It says: We consider that the jury directions, given at Hayes’ and subsequently Palombo’s trial and which were the basis of the court’s judgment, may apply to Jonathan Mathew, Jay Merchant, Alex Pabon, Philippe Moryoussef and Colin Bermingham’s trials. Therefore, their convictions may be considered unsafe. India’s economy grew faster than expected over the summer, new data shows, despite the threat of the Trump trade war. India’s GDP expanded by 7.8% year-on-year in the April-June quarter, picking up from 7.4% in the previous three months, data released today showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slowdown in growth to 6.7%. Over in Germany, the number of unemployed people has hit three million for the first time in a decade. A total of 3.02 million people were unemployed in August in seasonally unadjusted terms, with an increase of 46,000 in the number of people out of work from the previous month. Labour office head Andrea Nahles says: “The labor market is still shaped by the economic slump of recent years.” If you account for seasonal factors, though, the number of unemployed decreased by 9,000 to 2.96 million. Even so, the rise in joblessness intensifies the pressure on chancellor Friedrich Merz to reform and stimulate the German economy. Speaking in France today, Merz responded to the data: “The rise in unemployment is not unexpected. However, the figure illustrates how necessary reforms are for more growth and employability. The German government will focus on this.” The bank share selloff has gathered pace. NatWest are now down 4.7%, followed by Lloyds (-4.5%) and Barclays (-3.7%), with HSBC down a more modest 0.5%. By my maths, this wipes around £7bn off the value of the UK’s Big Four banks. The drop in bank shares has pulled down the wider London stock market. The FTSE 100 share idex is down 25 points, or 0.27%, at 9192 points this morning “The UK stock market ended the week on a sour note amid suggestions that the government could help to fill its fiscal hole with a new tax on the banking sector,” says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, adding: “Some of the biggest names in the FTSE 100 are lenders so if they’re out of favour on the stock market, it acts as a drag on the whole UK blue-chip index. “NatWest, Lloyds and Barclays were the FTSE 100’s biggest fallers on Friday morning as investors wondered if the era of bumper profits, dividends and buybacks is now under threat. “These companies have enjoyed a strong run on the stock market in recent years, and they’ve also played an important role in lending money to small and large businesses which helps to create jobs and support the UK economy. “The timing of the tax debate, fuelled by a report from think-tank IPPR, is unfortunate given it coincides with a new poll from Lloyds suggesting a rise in business confidence, despite cost pressures. This positive sentiment could be threatened if businesses take the view that a new tax on banks might force lenders to tighten their lending criteria. P&amp;O Ferries have confirmed that CEO Peter Hebblethwaite is resigning, explaining: “Peter Hebblethwaite has communicated his intention to resign from his position as Chief Executive Officer to dedicate more time to family matters. P&amp;O Ferries extends its gratitude to Peter Hebblethwaite for his contributions as CEO over the past four years. “During his tenure the company navigated the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, initiated a path towards financial stability, and introduced the world’s first large double-ended hybrid ferries on the Dover-Calais route, thereby enhancing sustainability. We extend our best wishes to him for his future endeavours.” Sky News are reporting that Peter Hebblethwaite, the chief executive of P&amp;O Ferries, is leaving the company. Hebblethwaite, who was voted the “Worst Boss in the World” by trade unionists in 2022, has reportedly resigned for personal reasons. Hebblethwaite attracted heavy criticism in 2022 after P&amp;O controversially fired 800 crew without warning, and replaced them with low-paid agency staff working longer hours. He subsequently receivd a pay rise of at least 55%. India’s currency has sunk to a record low, on fears that US tariffs will hurt its economy. The rupee has dropped by -0.7% today to 88.23 rupees to the dollar, its weakest level on record. Traders sold the rupee after Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods this week, doubling the total duties faced by the South Asian nation to 50%, as a penalty for buying Russian oil. The tariffs, which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and further disrupting global supply chains. With bank shares sliding, investors are piling into defence stocks instead. Babcock (+1.4%), Melrose (+0.95%) and BAE Systems (+0.7%) are all among the FTSE 100 risers, as optimism over a breakthough in the Russia-Ukraine war fades. German chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters last night that there was “obviously” not going to be a meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, despite Donald Trump’s push for a peace deal. Bloomberg’s Paul J Davies isn’t convinced by the IPPR’s call for a windfall tax on the banks. Posting on Blue Sky, he argues that it would be paid out of the interest that would otherwise go to savers, suggesting it could actually function as a “backdoor wealth tax”. But Davies also questions how much money new bank taxes would raise, posting: They are also talking again about a special extra profit tax for banks - Rayner suggested upping total take from 28% to 30%. Do you know how much this will raise? Based on OBR forecasts it would bring in an extra  £275m per year.  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, fears the swirl of budget rumours could hurt confidence (undermining the rise in morale this month). She explains: The decline in UK shares are led by the banks, which are all weighing on the FTSE 100 as rumours swirl of yet another tax rise, this time a windfall tax on lenders. Financials are down 1% on Friday, led by a 3% drop for NatWest, a 2.5% drop in Lloyds and a 2% fall for Barclays. The drip feed of potential tax rises to be included in this budget have dominated the papers this month, however, so far, the FTSE 100 has been resilient to this. However, now that it seems Rachel Reeves is going after the FTSE 100’s big hitters like banks, this could weigh on the index as we lead up to the Autumn budget. US stocks outperformed their European peers in August, with the S&amp;P 500 rising by 2%, compared to a 0.8% gain for the FTSE 100. This gap could widen, especially if we get the expected interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, at the same time as the UK government seems focused on squeezing businesses and consumers with multiple tax increases later this year, which is eroding confidence and dimming UK growth prospects further. UK banks are under pressure, reports Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. He explains: Overnight weakness in sterling would normally support the FTSE 100 given its proliferation of overseas earnings, but reports of a potential windfall tax on the banks more than offset any hopes of a bright open. The domestic banks were worst hit, with NatWest and Lloyds losing around 3%, while the more diversified groups such as Barclays and HSBC limited losses to around 1%. Unfortunately, any such rumours are likely to have an exaggerated impact given the government’s obvious need to raise more income in an attempt to mitigate its financial difficulties. Shares in UK banks are falling this morning as the sector fears it could be targeted in the autumn budget. NatWest (-3.7%), Lloyds Banking Group (-2.8%) and Barclays (-2.3%) are leading the fallers on the FTSE 100 share index, reflecting rising concerns that chancellor Rachel Reeves could target banks to help shore up the UK’s public finances. The IPPR think tank is this morning proposing that Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax. They argue that a “Thatcher-style tax on bank windfalls” could raise billions for public services. The IPPR points out that the UK government is currently spending billions of pounds a year compensating the Bank of England for losses on its quantitative easing programme, which is now being unwound. The BoE is also paying out higher interest rates on banks’ reserves than it is receiving on the bonds it still owns through QE. In total, these losses amount to a £22bn-a-year hit to the public finances, according to the IPPR, which is calling for the Treasury to tax the big banks on their QE-related reserves. Carsten Jung, associate director for economic policy at IPPR, said: “The Bank of England and Treasury bungled the implementation of quantitative easing. What started as a programme to boost the economy is now a massive drain on taxpayer money. Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design. While families struggle with rising costs, the government is effectively writing multi-billion-pound cheques to bank shareholders. “This is not how QE was meant to work – and no other major economy does it this way. A targeted levy, inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s own approach in the 1980s, would recoup some these windfalls and put the money to far better use – helping people and the economy, not just bank balance sheets.” The Financial Times reports that fears are growing in the City of London that Reeves could announce a surcharge on the banking sector’s profits, or a new bank levy. One City figure told the FT: “We aren’t stupid. There’s a bunch of Labour MPs, including Angela Rayner, who are looking for ways to get more money. Financial services are an obvious target.” In the financial markets, the US dollar is on track to record a 2% monthly drop as traders anticipate Donald Trump will soon get his way on interest rate cuts. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six major peers, is slightly higher this morning but still course for a 2% decline for the month. The index is down around 10% this year, hit by anxiety over US economic policy as Trump’s trade wars pushed investors towards alternative assets. Trump’s attempts to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed board, and his plans for a replacement for chair Jerome Powell, show that the White House is determined to push for lower interest rates. Deutsche Bank told clients this morning: Investors remain heavily focused on the Federal Reserve’s independence, and today there’s going to be an emergency hearing about Lisa Cook’s position on the Board of Governors that’s due to start at 10am EST. So this is going to be critically important for markets, as her removal would give President Trump the opportunity to refashion the Board of Governors in a more dovish direction. UK companies are also eyeing up more price rises. In August, the net balance of firms expecting to raise prices over the next year was up four points to 65%. 67% (from 65%) of firms said they would raise prices in the coming year, while those anticipating price reductions fell slightly to 2% (from 4%), Lloyds says. There’s good news for workers, too, in the latest business barometer. Wage growth expectations increased by four points, with 38% forecasting average pay increases of 3% or more. Firms expecting to increase wages by 4% rose five points to 23%, while those forecasting 5% or higher also climbed five points to 12%. That would help employees handle the rise in UK inflation, which hit 3.8% in July. But it might concern the Bank of England, where some policymakers fear that increased earnings could lead to a further rise in prices… Businesses across five of the UK’s twelve regions and nations saw a rise in confidence in August, but the increase was not universal. London, the East of England and the West Midlands saw strong improvements this month. However, firms in Wales were less confident, with a fall of 13 points, Lloyds reports. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Despite the tides of gloom lapping the UK economy, business confidence has pushed up this month. The latest poll of business morale from Lloyds Banking Group shows that British businesses’ confidence in their trading prospects has hit the highest level since 2014, after rising sharply this month. According to Lloyds, manufacturers’ confidence is the highest in a decade – welcome news for the government as chancellor Rachel Reeves and her team work on the autumn budget. Retailers’ confidence also increased, to a five-month high, but construction confidence fell to a four-month low. Interestingly, the Lloyds Business Barometer has found that hiring intentions increased for the fourth month in a row, despite cost pressures. That indicates many businesses are coping with the £26bn increase in employers’ national insurance announced by Reeves last year, and the latest increase in the minimum wage. Economic optimism edged down for the first time since April, though, indicating increased jitters about the economic outlook. Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: “This continued upward trend in business confidence suggests UK firms remain optimistic about their own trading prospects while there is a modest cooling of confidence in the wider UK economy. Firms are focusing on what they can control, with many looking to pursue growth opportunities, including entering new markets and adopting new technologies. “Wage expectations have seen a notable shift this month, but it remains to be seen whether this signals the start of a sustained trend or a temporary uplift, as they have been broadly stable in recent months.” The agenda 7.45am BST: French GDP and consumer spending data 1.30pm BST: US trade data 1.30pm BST: US PCE inflation measure for July 3pm BST: University of Michigan US consumer confidence report

36) ‘It’s like Sleeping Beauty; we have to wake them’: winemakers urged to help save earthworms — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/29/vineyards-winemakers-urged-help-save-earthworms
   Text:
     Vineyards are generally the most inhospitable of landscapes for the humble earthworm; the soil beneath vines is usually kept bare and compacted by machinery. But scientists and winemakers have been exploring ways to turn vineyards into havens for worms. The bare soil is problematic because worms need vegetation to be broken down by the microorganisms they eat. Pesticides are also highly harmful to the invertebrate, as is the practice of compacting the earth: worms need the soil to be porous so they can move through it. Earthworms are important and threatened invertebrates – the engineers of an ecosystem that may be as diverse as the Amazon rainforest. Their diggings aerate soil and they pull fallen leaves and other organic matter into the earth and recycle them. But their populations have declined by a third in the UK over the past 25 years due to pesticide use and over-tilling of soil. Marc-André Selosse, a professor at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, has been urging vineyards to increase grass and plant cover on their soil, and reduce the amount they till, to save the worms. Selosse said: “In France, the vineyards are 3% of the agricultural area, and they are using 20% of the chemicals. In vineyards, for the soil there is a lot of treatments, so there’s a lot of compaction, and there is a lot of pesticides used. This all doesn’t mean the soil is dead because dead soil doesn’t exist, but it is the soil on which there is the most to do and on which we have a lot of data to do better.” Worms had not yet vanished from the most intensively farmed vineyards, he said, but they did need to be supported with more regenerative practices. “I think the worms are at a low level,” he said. “They are just surviving, but they are still there, which means that no one is thinking of buying earthworms for the soil, because they are there. It’s like Sleeping Beauty; they are there at very low level, and we have to wake them. But once again, in soil, we have resilience. It’s one part of biodiversity where they are so numerous that we were not able to kill all of them.” Selosse said the main thing vineyards could do for worms was to stop tilling the soil – breaking it up and turning it over – even if that means that herbicides such as glyphosate are used instead to remove weeds. “When you go to no tillage, even when you use glyphosate, you increase the biomass of microbes [which the worms eat] by 30% which means that it’s better. It doesn’t mean it’s perfect, because you use glyphosate, but because of no tillage, it is better. In the future, sooner or later, we’ll have to stop glyphosate also but for now, tilling is the first cause of worm problems.” Now some vineyards in the UK are making worm-friendly wine. When Jules and Lucie Phillips, co-owners of Ham Street Wines in Kent, started their vineyard, they were advised to grow conventionally by tilling and using pesticides, but were horrified by the results. Julessaid: “After we did that, we went out and we dug a soil pit immediately after planting, and then also later in the season, and we realised the soil was just dead. There were no worms. It was smelling not particularly interesting at all, and the structure was poor.” The pair had a revelation. “We just thought, this is completely the wrong way of farming and we need to do something different. We want life in our soils. And so we began the conversion to organic in that same year, and we’re now certified biodynamic.” Rather than using pesticides, they applied herbal teas to the vines to promote plant health, Jules said: “For example, horsetail tea has a real high silica content, and that improves the leaf cell wall and means that it’s more resilient.” The couple run a no-till system under the vine: “We’ve let the cover crop grow really long, and we typically let it grow right up into the canopy up until about flowering, and then we’ll mow it back. And the benefits of that are huge. The cover crop is really growing and really establishing that root structure and getting it to its maximum point. And finally, we put a big mulch on top of the soil that’s going to feed those worms and feed that soil life.” This has hugely helped their worm population: “We’ve seen our worm counts increase massively from basically none to around 20 or 30 in a spade full. So extrapolate that up to a square metre, and it’s a very decent volume.” Rob Poyser, a viticulturist at the regenerative wine consultancy firm Vinescapes, said that growing wildflowers in the vineyards they consult on had also brought great results. “We think in between three and five years we can take a bare soil and bring it back to life, into a thriving ecosystem,” he said. “We’ve used things like cover crops to bring this vineyard to life, to build the fertility into this system, and organic matter. We’re bringing life back to these soils we’re using. We’re letting nature do it.” Poyser said they allowed wildflowers to grow all over the vineyards, and clients were delighted when clover, for example, sprung up because “clovers are great companion plants under the vine for grapevines, they’re also loved by earthworms”.

37) ‘Just hysteria’: UK faces a crisis but the Denis Healey comparison is overblown — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     International confidence in the UK government’s economic policies had evaporated. Growth was stalling, inflation was galloping, and Labour – back in power after a reckless Conservative administration had gambled on tax cuts – was in deep trouble. It was 1976, when James Callaghan’s government was forced to go cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan. Fast forward almost half a century and some economists are drawing obvious parallels. Just as Callaghan’s chancellor, Denis Healey, did before her, Rachel Reeves is facing a challenge to placate jittery global investors. The UK’s long-term borrowing costs have risen close to their highest level since 1998, adding to pressure on the chancellor before a tough autumn budget. With a lacklustre growth outlook, sticky inflation, and Labour’s welfare U-turns hitting the public finances, most economists expect Reeves to announce a raft of tax increases to cover a shortfall of between £20bn and £40bn against her main, self-imposed, fiscal target. Last weekend the Sunday Telegraph ran an article headlined: Britain heading towards IMF bailout, featuring quotes from three experienced economists comparing the fiscal mess facing the two Labour administrations 49 years apart. However, for most economists, comparisons with Healey’s begging-bowl plea to the global lender of last resort are significantly overblown. “You can quote me as saying that is complete nonsense… something like that is just hysteria,” said Michael Saunders, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. “That is not to say the UK does not have a weak fiscal position. It does. But it is somewhere well between that and an IMF bailout.” Back in the autumn of 1976, inflation was running close to 17%, having hit a postwar high of almost 25% a year earlier; it forced the Bank to drive interest rates up to 15%. Sterling was in freefall and the UK government faced a buyers’ strike among investors who would normally purchase its bonds, known as gilts. This week the Treasury sold £5bn of three-year gilts to institutional investors in an auction that was more than three times oversubscribed. The pound has strengthened against other major currencies this year. Inflation is on track to peak at 4%, up from 3.8% currently, economic growth in the first half of 2025 was the fastest in the G7, and Threadneedle Street cut interest rates this month by a quarter-point, to 4%. Benchmarking things to the 1970s, is, though, a mainstay of British political discourse. The IMF bailout episode became synonymous with national humiliation, and led to Labour’s 1979 defeat and long exile from government. Jagjit Chadha, a Cambridge university economist and former director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), who was quoted by the Telegraph, said it could not be predicted whether an IMF loan was required. But he warned the UK’s “unsustainable path” should not be underplayed. “We need to address this risk not devalue it,” he said. At the Treasury, the most painful episode in postwar economic history remains burned into the institutional memory. Within weeks of Labour’s return to power last year, officials briefed ministers with a 25-minute PowerPoint presentation on the importance of keeping markets onside. Liz Truss triggering a meltdown in the market for UK government debt with her September 2022 mini-budget had been a potent reminder of the fragile conditions in markets, and underscored Britain’s delicate position. Baked into the rise in government borrowing costs are several ingredients. After a succession of shocks – from the 2008 financial crisis, to Brexit and the Covid pandemic – the UK’s national debt has risen to the highest level as a share of GDP since the 1960s. The return of high inflation and the end of rock-bottom interest rates has made servicing those debts more expensive. An ageing population and political pressure to mend battered public services has added to the strain. The Bank has also complicated matters further. Although it is cutting rates, the central bank is also selling UK government bonds to unwind its crisis-era quantitative easing scheme, adding to the supply of debt investors are being called on to buy. Earlier this month, Threadneedle Street admitted for the first time that this had contributed to the rise in the UK’s long-term borrowing costs. At its next policy meeting on 18 September, the Bank will decide whether to reduce its sales over the next 12 months. Most economists believe a reduction is likely. Britain is not alone in facing challenges. Borrowing costs have risen across advanced economies, in part because of Donald Trump’s trade wars and his assault on the independence of the US Federal Reserve. Several other countries are seen as running unsustainable fiscal policies, including France, where Emmanuel Macron’s government is in crisis. Chris Scicluna, a former Treasury economist who is now head of research at the Japanese bank Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, said the UK was more reliant on overseas investors to buy its debt than some other countries were. “Debt stocks are much higher than they used to be. Therefore governments need to be offering higher yields to attract buyers, and there’s no shortage – whether from the US, euro area or Japan – and unfortunately the UK has to compete to attract investors.” Many investors believe that Reeves has made a rod for her own back. Labour promising before the general election not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT has left big revenue-raisers off limits. Labour’s welfare U-turns show that further spending restraint is not an option. Neil Mehta, a hedge fund manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said: “The government can’t contain spending or tax effectively without breaking manifesto rules. No one wants to make the tough political choices. If we continue like this the market will act as the enforcer, like it has done many times in the past.” The trouble for Reeves is that raising taxes to balance the books could undermine economic growth. Her previous measures also stoked inflation. That in turn would be viewed negatively in financial markets, in what some economists refer to as an effective doom loop. Andrew Sentance, a former MPC member, said that comparisons to the 1970s were valid, but that suggesting an impending IMF bailout was hyperbole. “I do not think in the UK’s case we are heading for an IMF bailout,” he told the Guardian. “You have a cocktail of problems which is very reminiscent of the 1970s. Does that mean we have to go to the IMF? No, not necessarily. Does it mean there is some kind of reckoning in terms of an economic crisis coming up, of some sort? Yes, that’s quite likely.”

38) P&O chief who prompted outrage by sacking nearly 800 staff is to quit — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The chief executive described as “Britain’s most hated boss” after sacking almost 800 workers at P&amp;O Ferries is to leave the company. Peter Hebblethwaite prompted outrage in 2022 after P&amp;O Ferries dismissed 786 staff and replaced them with low-paid agency workers, who received considerably less than the UK minimum wage. At the time the cross-Channel ferry company was accused of operating like “pirates of the high sea” and during questioning at a parliamentary hearing Darren Jones, then chair of the business committee, asked: “Are you in this mess because you don’t know what you’re doing, or are you just a shameless criminal?” Hebblethwaite always said his actions were the only way of saving the ferry group from going bust. No criminal charges were brought after the sackings. A spokesperson for P&amp;O Ferries, a subsidiary of the Dubai-based ports operator DP World, said: “Peter Hebblethwaite has communicated his intention to resign from his position as chief executive officer to dedicate more time to family matters. P&amp;O Ferries extends its gratitude to Peter Hebblethwaite for his contributions as CEO over the past four years. “During his tenure the company navigated the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, initiated a path towards financial stability, and introduced the world’s first large double-ended hybrid ferries on the Dover-Calais route, thereby enhancing sustainability. We extend our best wishes to him for his future endeavours.” The change of management at P&amp;O Ferries, which was first reported by Sky News, follows the company wrestling with its governance after twice failing to publish its annual accounts on time, which is technically a criminal offence. The ferry operator’s 2022 accounts were almost 11 months late when they were belatedly published in November last year and showed that the company spent more than £47m on jettisoning its UK seafarers. Earlier this year, it emerged that P&amp;O had hired a tiny four-person auditing firm to replace KPMG, one of the “big four” accountancy firms, which resigned from approving its annual accounts in March. When P&amp;O Ferries’ 2023 accounts were finally published in July, they revealed that Hebblethwaite had been paid £683,000 in the financial year after making the controversial dismissals, a pay rise of at least 55% that included a £183,000 bonus. “I reflected on accepting that payment, but ultimately I did decide to accept it,” Hebblethwaite told MPs. “I do recognise it is not a decision that everybody would have made.” The increased remuneration contrasted sharply with the pay that had been received by seafarers onboard the company’s ferries. In 2022, the businessman told parliamentarians that the lowest-paid agency worker would receive £5.15 an hour, only for a Guardian and ITV News investigation in March 2024 to reveal how some seafarers were receiving an hourly rate as low as £4.87. Hebblethwaite was recalled to appear in front of another select committee hearing two months after the expose and conceded that “the lowest, fully consolidated hourly pay is about £4.87”. When the Guardian and ITV News had previously asked P&amp;O about the £4.87 an hour figure, a spokesperson had said: “We do not recognise the pay rates that you are referencing. No member of our crew on our Dover-Calais vessels earns less than $2,400 per month, equivalent to £5.20 per hour.” The company was able to pay rates considerably below the UK minimum wage because maritime workers, employed by an overseas agency who work on foreign-registered ships in international waters, were exempt from the relevant legislation. As P&amp;O used that specific model, the level of pay on board its vessels was legal. However, last year new legislation in the UK and France became active. Pay rates are understood to have risen onboard P&amp;O vessels since. In its latest accounts, the company lost £91.4m before tax in 2023, a considerable improvement on the £249.4m losses in 2022. The accounts show that it transported 4.6 million passengers in 2023, a 45% reduction on the 8.4 million carried in 2018.

39) UN to end Lebanon peacekeeping mission next year after Israeli and US pressure — The Guardian (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/un-unifil-lebanon-peacekeeping-mission-withdrawal
   Text:
     The UN security council has voted to extend the body’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a further 16 months, but ordered it finished at the end of 2026 under Israeli and US pressure. UNSC members voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the mandate for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil) ahead of its expiration on Sunday, prompting relief from Lebanese officials who rely on it. The approved resolution said Unifil would begin an “orderly and safe withdrawal” of its 10,800 peacekeepers from Lebanon in December 2026. The planned withdrawal will end the more than 47-year-long peacekeeping mission. Initially created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Unifil’s soldiers patrol the shared border between Israel and Lebanon. The force has been tasked with monitoring and reporting violations of the November ceasefire between Hezbollah and Lebanon, so the Lebanese army can enforce the terms of the agreement. Thursday’s UN resolution said it aimed to make the Lebanese government “the sole provider of security” in south Lebanon, and called for Israel to withdraw its forces. Israel has continued to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon and carry out hundreds of airstrikes in violation of the ceasefire, which it said were done to prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding its military infrastructure. The vote came after months of pressure by the Israeli and US governments, who have made ending the Unifil mission a priority. After the vote, the US ambassador to the UN, Dorothy Shea, said it was the last time the US would extend the Unifil mission. “The United States notes that the first ‘i’ in Unifil stands for ‘interim’. The time has come for Unifil’s mission to end,” she said. The decision was also praised by the Israeli representative to the UN, Danny Danon, who said: “For a change, we have some good news coming from the UN.” Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the US has moved closer to Israel’s position on Unifil. Israel has long considered Unifil to provide political cover to Hezbollah by failing to adequately disarm the militia in southern Lebanon since the end of the 2006 war, and has pushed for the mission to be disbanded. Israel attacked Unifil positions throughout the war with Hezbollah, injuring peacekeepers as a result. Unifil’s mandate means it is only a monitoring force and cannot use force except in self-defence. Instead, violations are reported to the Lebanese army, which is leading the disarmament of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Peacekeepers have also come under pressure from Hezbollah, with residents loyal to the group in south Lebanon frequently stopping patrols, throwing stones at military vehicles and on one occasion, slapping a peacekeeper. The Lebanese state has relied on Unifil to help create a buffer with Israel and support its under-equipped army to reassert state control over south Lebanon. The prime minister, Nawaf Salam, praised the UN resolution, saying it “reiterates the call for Israel to withdraw its forces from the five sites it continues to occupy, and affirms the necessity of extending state authority over all its territory”. Other nations involved, such as France and Italy, objected to the eventual withdrawal of peacekeepers, saying it could hamstring the Lebanese army’s ability to establish itself in south Lebanon. The army will next week present a plan to disarm Hezbollah. It wants to do so in a way that does not provoke a confrontation with the well-armed group and preserves civil peace in Lebanon.

40) Anna Moorhouse: ‘England’s Euro 2025 win put my heart rate through the roof’ — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     “We were like: ‘If Chloe scores this, we win, right? Wait a second – this is it!’” That is what went through Anna Moorhouse’s mind as she stood alongside her teammates while Chloe Kelly stepped up to take England’s decisive penalty in the Euro 2025 final. Suddenly it was “just running and pure emotion” for the goalkeeper and her fellow substitutes. Moorhouse was the third-fastest to reach Kelly in the ensuing sprint, after Esme Morgan and Maya Le Tissier. The delirious celebrations continued all the way to the Mall in London two days later but by Wednesday that week Moorhouse had landed back in Florida to rejoin Orlando Pride and play a National Women’s Soccer League fixture on Sunday. The 30-year-old says she slept for the whole of her transatlantic flight before receiving a joyous welcome from her teammates at the club, where she was soon signing a contract extension to stay with the defending NWSL champions until the end of 2027. “Orlando has kind of become my home over the past couple of years,” Moorhouse says. “I’m really pleased to have signed. Playing overseas, it takes a little bit of pressure off. You don’t have that constant pressure from media and stuff like that. You don’t have to worry about anything like that. It’s just a nicer life out here to take away that mental load and that pressure.” Few football environments could provide more pressure than being part of the England squad in Switzerland, where Moorhouse experienced a major international tournament for the first time, especially after the defeat in the opening game, against France. Still, as she says, the Lionesses stuck together to deliver an “insane” victory. “We were very unified … I think it showed on the pitch more than anything. We had a big meeting after the France game to kind of come together and be like: ‘We can either keep on playing this way or we can stick together and get behind each other and kind of dig in,’ which I think you then saw through the rest of the tournament. “Sometimes when you’re in a group of people like that, spending so much time together, you can get sick of each other, but it wasn’t the case. We would go to the spa every afternoon, hang out and just enjoyed each other’s company, and I feel like it did really translate on to the pitch when we were playing. We didn’t do it the easy way; we definitely made it a lot more hard work and my heart rate and my blood pressure has been through the roof, honestly. But it [was] just incredible. I don’t think I’ve processed it still, the way that we won, the way that we came back in all those games. The whole team did an amazing job, one team bringing it home.” As one of two backup goalkeepers behind Hannah Hampton, the former Arsenal, West Ham and Bordeaux player was part of the goalkeeping union preparing for the possibility of penalty shootouts. Moorhouse worked with Hampton, Manchester City’s Khiara Keating and England’s goalkeeping coach, Darren Ward. “Hannah had a great tournament,” Moorhouse says. “The penalty shootouts – just incredible. The work that goes in behind that success is a lot. And honestly, as goalkeepers, we don’t even see that: it’s the stuff from the analysis, it’s from Darren doing the work behind that. And then for 30 minutes, we talk about it. And then Hannah has to produce in the penalty shootout, which she did. I think we got the information and made the right judgments every time. Hannah does the work and me, Khiara and Darren behind the scenes are, not influencing, but kind of trying to guide her into making those decisions and we have conversations surrounding that. It’s just really nice to see her make those saves to win games.” Moorhouse is enjoying a sustained spell as Orlando’s first-choice keeper, keeping 14 clean sheets in 29 regular-season games last term to help them win their first NWSL title. “I’m enjoying being the No 1,” she says. “I’m doing everything I can to stay there. I’m enjoying the pressure that comes with it and also the privilege that comes with that too.” Her team sit fourth in the NWSL before Friday’s fixture against her England teammate Jess Carter’s Gotham FC, with Kansas City Current leading the 14-team league; the top eight enter the playoffs. Moorhouse credits a lot of Orlando’s success to their English head coach, the former Middlesbrough defender Seb Hines: “The main part for me is stability. I think historically the club had a lot of turnover of players and staff so keeping a core group of players together over the past couple of years has really helped. And everyone knowing what Seb expects and those principles that he has really helped. “He puts a lot of onus on us as players to take accountability for what we’re doing on the pitch. He gives us a core set of values and things that we want to achieve on the pitch, but it’s really up to us in our creativity to manage the way that we play. I’m not saying the players decide, but we have an input in how we want to play. It’s definitely a holistic approach. “We had some unbelievable achievements last year. We just want to keep going and try and catch Kansas back up. They’re having an incredible season this year. We can definitely do it again. We just need to stick together as a team and keep playing the way that we know we can. We can still win things. We’re not done. We’re not finished.”

41) ‘He’s a real human being with flaws’: the complicated life of Alexander McQueen hits the stage — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     “You have always made the most beautiful things out of absolute shit.” This is Darrah Cloud’s favourite line in her new play about Alexander McQueen, dubbed the bad boy or enfant terrible of British fashion. “It’s what he did,” Cloud explains via Zoom from New York. “He had the ability to translate trauma into beauty or joy into beauty or an oyster shell into a dress. I mean, what an extraordinary thing.” House of McQueen, opening off Broadway on 9 September, explores how McQueen, a taxi driver’s son from working-class London, rose to the top of the fashion industry with a combination of provocative spectacle and flawless craftsmanship. Cloud adds: “He’s like an analogue person in a coming digital world. The oyster dress still has his DNA on it, I’m sure, because he sewed it himself. It’s not like he sent the design off to Japan and had them make it in a factory. A lot of the fashions are one of a kind because of that.” The young Lee McQueen – he later switched to his middle name, Alexander, because it sounded posh – left school at 16 and apprenticed as a tailor on Savile Row, where legend has it he scrawled obscenities inside the lining of a jacket destined for Prince Charles. McQueen pursued a master’s degree at the prestigious art and design college Central Saint Martins, where his graduation collection, inspired by Jack the Ripper, was bought by the fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who became his patron and mentor. His early collections caused shock waves. In Highland Rape, dishevelled models staggered down the runway with their Scottish-inspired clothing ripped to expose breasts and nether regions. He said: “I don’t want a show where you come out feeling like you’ve just had Sunday lunch. I want you to come out either feeling repulsed or exhilarated.” In 1996 McQueen got his big break, becoming chief designer at Givenchy, where he clashed with the constraints of a heritage house but produced memorable, sometimes unsettling shows. He founded his own label, Alexander McQueen, that grappled with death, nature, folklore, and the tension between beauty and horror. His theatrical runway shows included a model encased in a glass box surrounded by butterflies, robotic spray-painting on the catwalk and holographic projections of Kate Moss. He won four British Designer of the Year awards and a CBE in 2003. But he struggled with mental health and substance abuse and killed himself at the age of 40. House of McQueen stars Luke Newton, best known for playing Colin in Netflix’s Bridgerton, as McQueen and Emily Skinner as his mother, Joyce McQueen. The show is executive-produced by Rick Lazes while Gary James McQueen, the designer’s nephew, serves as creative director. Cloud was approached to write the script in January 2020, and having been awed by the exhibition Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, had no hesitation about jumping on board. “I wanted to do it immediately because I didn’t know much about Lee. I was eager to dive into how he did this and where this all came from. “As a fellow artist spending a life trying to fix the world with my writing, I related to his struggle, to his having been born in the East End of London. He wasn’t supposed to get out of that neighbourhood yet he did. “He did it by believing in himself. Joyce McQueen had a lot to do with that. She plays a big role in the play. I related to the story, I related to his anger, I related to the things that inspired him and how he worked through that.” She adds: “That struggle between art and commerce was lifelong for him and painful. He was a person who did wear his heart on his sleeve. I love people like that. Those people who feel that deeply are gems, are treasures.” Using a non-linear narrative structure, and enhanced by ﬂoor-to-ceiling LED panels, House of McQueen considers the mentors, collaborators, and peers who had a profound influence on McQueen’s life and boundary-pushing career. “He wasn’t alone. He was nurtured. He was nurtured by a fabulous mum, a supportive but difficult household. Support and appreciation come in different styles. A difficult father might just be your biggest fan. I guess I want people to walk away going ‘what a loss’ and ‘what a great artist’ and understanding what it takes to make great art.” The show’s director, Sam Helfrich, says these interactions form a “landscape of memory” of people who “caused him great pain and heartache and guilt and tragedy” but also provided “moments of beauty, moments of joy, moments of fantasy”. Helfrich says: “They’re all people who could have easily said, ‘I’m not interested in you,’ and the whole thing would have come to a halt. But one after another after another there are these people in this world who see something. “That’s where the magic comes in. What do they see with a piece of cloth in their hands? What did they see with some punky kid standing before them asking for a job? These are important moments. Making those into theatrical moments was interesting to me.” Even so, McQueen’s move to France and relationship with the fashion house Givenchy was tumultuous. Helfrich reflects: “That exchange between art and commerce, the struggle to be an artist and also to make money and serve the needs of people like the House of Givenchy or Gucci, is all part of the mix. “Lee didn’t always make perfect decisions. There’s a scene in the play where he meets Tom Ford and that’s a very complicated scene. It’s a scene where for the audience, you leave the scene thinking, ’Was that the right decision, was that the right thing to do? Is that a compromise? Did he just somehow diminish himself as an artist? Or maybe he didn’t.’ It’s a complicated scene where you think maybe Lee’s not always perfect and doesn’t always treat people nicely either.” At the end of his life, two deaths devastated McQueen. Blow took her life in 2007 and, in early 2010, McQueen’s beloved mother died. Only days later – on the eve of her funeral – the designer killed himself after taking drugs. The play does not seek to draw firm conclusions about his motivation. Helfrich says: “It’s easy for all of us to be armchair psychologists and say these are the reasons why. But hopefully the play presents a more complicated portrait than that and doesn’t end on an obvious ‘Oh, well, it was inevitable,’ because by the time you get to that point in the play we don’t want it to happen: there’s too many great things going on right now so this can’t be happening. That’s what I want people to think.” Helfrich regards the show as “a theatrical event and not a biography” and drew on deep experience in directing opera productions in New York, Salzburg and elsewhere. He directed John Adams’ Nixon in China at the Eugene Opera. He says: “The project does feel operatic in many ways, even though it’s not an opera. It’s got a lot of scope and it’s a big story. It to me is a very Verdi and Shakespearean story in many ways. I was attracted to it for that reason and I think they were attracted to me for the same reason. My thinking is very operatic.” Cloud, for her part, says her career has been spent making people with seemingly obscure lives into epic heroes. “So it kind of fit with this in the sense that I wanted to concentrate on Lee’s humanity and familiarity as a human,” she explains. “He’s not this untouchable epic person. He’s a real human being with flaws. He was difficult and he was funny and he was irrational and neurotic and all the things that we all are. I find that heroic.” House of McQueen is now in previews at the Mansion at Hudson Yards in New York and will open officially on 9 September • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

42) UK bans Israeli officials from flagship defence show — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

     The UK has banned Israeli officials from attending the country’s flagship defence event next month. Israeli industry, including UK subsidiaries of Israeli companies, will be able to attend London’s Defence &amp; Security Equipment International (DSEI) show in September but the UK government will not invite representatives of the Israeli government to the major industry event. It comes as Keir Starmer prepares to recognise a Palestinian state after warning Israel the UK would do so if the country did not take steps to relieve suffering in Gaza or meet other conditions. A UK government spokesperson said: “The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong. As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025. “There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.” Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion, as it has done previously at the DSEI. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael, IAI and Uvision, will be able to attend. Britain’s decision has echoes of a dispute at the Paris air show three months ago, when France blocked off with black partitions the stands of Israeli defence companies after they refused to remove attack weapons from display, prompting a furious response from Israel. Israel said Britain’s decision was a “regrettable act of discrimination” and “introduces political considerations wholly inappropriate for a professional defence industry exhibition”. The four-day show, due to open on 9 September, features national delegations and private companies, which showcase military kit and weapons at London’s ExCel centre. The event takes place every other year. DSEI is organised by a private company, Clarion Defence &amp; Security, with backing from the British government and the military.

     The $350,000 (£250,000) Sinquefield Cup is one of the most iconic annual events in the chess calendar. Part of the Grand Chess Tour and named after the St Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefield, who has been the most generous individual sponsor in all chess history, it will be remembered for Fabiano Caruana’s 7/7 start in 2014 and his record 3098 tournament performance, for Ding Liren’s victory ahead of Magnus Carlsen in 2019, and, most of all, for the controversial 2022 Carlsen-Hans Niemann alleged cheating scandal. For 2025, the organisers introduced a four-player Tour Final at São Paulo next month, and the jockeying for position for that dominated the action. At the end, Caruana and Wesley So (US) and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu (India) tied with 5.5/9, ahead of Levon Aronian (US) 5, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France), Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Poland) and Sam Sevian (US) 4.5, the world champion Gukesh Dommaraju (India) 4, Alireza Firouzja (France) 3.5, Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzbekistan) 2.5. The first three plus Vachier-Lagrave got the final qualification spots, but So missed out due to sub-par performances earlier in the Tour, while Gukesh again disappointed. The speed playoff, which took place after the arbiter rejected a request from the players that the title be shared, ended So 1.5, Praggnanandhaa 1, Caruana 0.5. So had previously won the Sinquefield Cup in 2016, but the former Filipino plays fewer events nowadays, although his success in St Louis has raised him to world No 7 in the live ratings. He will miss next week’s Fide Grand Swiss in Samarkand, and joked: “Now they have a tough, meatgrinder tournament in Uzbekistan while I get to rest!” The key game of the event was So’s final round victory against the tailender Abdusattorov, which brought him into a tie with Caruana and Praggnanandhaa. After winning it, So gave thanks to God, his mother, and … England’s Gawain Maroroa Jones, whose book Coffeehouse Repertoire 1 e4 recommends the opening line which So chose against Abdusattorov. “It’s actually a very risky line,” he said. “If Black plays perfectly, White is even a bit worse, but I thought I had to risk it.” The highlight of the game is White’s marathon king march from g1 to b3 before launching the decisive push of his king’s side pawns. It is a subtle and impressive strategy, characteristic of So at his best. The tournament regulations forbade agreed draws, yet every one of the 21 games among the top seven was halved. How come? GMs have become adept at tacit agreements to hoover everything bar bare kings off the board, as a less provocative alternative to early threefold repetitions like the Berlin Wall. It may be better for 2026 if the Sinquefield Cup was restored to its place as the climax of the Grand Chess Tour and as a tribute to a legendary chess sponsor. Gukesh failed again, but will have a chance to revive his career in late October, when the St Louis Chess Club celebrates its reopening after a refurbishment with a special edition of its annual Champions Showdown, featuring Carlsen, Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Gukesh in a double round rapid tournament. This $400,000 event will be the highest rated tournament of the year, and will be Carlsen’s first appearance in St Louis since the notorious 2022 Sinquefield Cup and his game with Hans Niemann, which created one of the biggest scandals in chess history. Before that, the 116-player Fide Grand Swiss starting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan on 3 September will qualify two more world title Candidates, and the 72-player Women’s Grand Swiss will do likewise. GM Nikita Vitiugov is England’s only contender after Michael Adams, Maroroa Jones, Luke McShane and David Howell all declined invites or were too inactive to meet the regulations. On current form, Praggnanandhaa and Vincent Keymer will be the favourites in Samarkand, but the Swiss System format makes for an open event. Adams’s British Championship win was followed by a meagre 3/9 at the Rubinstein Memorial in Polanica-Zdroj, Poland. The draw was unkind to Adams, who had three Blacks in his first four games in a strong all-play-all, and after a couple of tactical oversights he was often under pressure. He fought back at the end, and his brilliant 28…Qg5!! in round eight, with the main idea of 29…Qd2! induced his opponent’s immediate resignation. Whose achievement was/is best, nine-time British champion Henry Atkins, 10-time winner Jonathan Penrose, or nine-time champion Adams? I think Adams has it on several counts. Atkins’s titles came when British chess was at a low ebb, when Fred Yates and Sir George Thomas were his major rivals, while Joseph Blackburne was in decline and Sultan Khan had not yet arrived. Similarly, Penrose won all his championships in a 10-year period from 1958 to 1969 when Hugh Alexander and Harry Golombek were ageing while the Raymond Keene – William Hartston generation had not yet emerged. For his part, Adams has seen off three strong GM generations, from Nigel Short and Tony Miles through Matthew Sadler and McShane to Howell and Maroroa Jones. In terms of winning percentages, Atkins and Adams (both nine title wins in 11 starts) are ahead. In terms of avoiding individual defeats, Adams is supreme, with just one loss in 127 games, and that was in a rapid playoff to McShane in 2018. In contrast, Penrose lost in three successive years (1959, 60, 61) to the same opponent, and it should have been four had that player not cravenly offered a draw in 1958 when two pawns up. 3987: 1 Ba6+! If 1…Kb8 2 Kb6! h1=Q 3 Nd7+ Ka8 4 Bb7 mate. If 1…Kd8 2 Ne6+ Ke8 3 Be2! h1=Q 4 Bh5+! Qxh5 5 Ng7+ and 6 Nxh5 wins.

44) Friday briefing: Why are Palestinians shut out of post-war plans while former PM discusses their future? — The Guardian (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Good morning. Tony Blair is back and he has plans for the Middle East. No, you have not woken up and jumped back two decades in time. The former Labour leader, who was put under pressure to resign after the disastrous decision to go to war with Iraq – which led to the death of a million Iraqis and created a vacuum later filled by the brutal Islamic State – is back in the headlines this week. Blair has attended a White House meeting with Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, according to recent reports. The former British prime minister has been working on a proposal for several months for the governance in Gaza after the war ends. The 72-year-old has reportedly been doing so with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, and the Emirati foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed. Who appears to be missing from this roundtable on who will govern Palestinians in Gaza? The Palestinians themselves. While reporting suggests Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was briefed, there is little indication that Palestinians have any real say. But Palestinians are not voiceless as our current leaders often imply. Nor must they remain at the mercy of those more powerful. They also have their own plan for a postwar Gaza. To understand what leaders of Palestinian civil society are calling for, and what drives their continuing struggle for self-determination, I spoke to Ubai Al-Aboudi, director of the Bisan Center for Research and Development and member of the steering committee of the Palestinian NGO Network. He is based in Ramallah. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | The UK and European Union have summoned their Russian envoys after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and damaged British Council and EU offices. UK news | The Treasury is reportedly considering a tax on landlords in the autumn budget that would target income from rents. The proposals are centred on the expansion of national insurance to include rental income. Iran | The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites. US news | The White House named non-scientist Jim O’Neill, a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr, to serve as acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amid a standoff over the firing of director Susan Monarez whose lawyers said she could only be removed by Donald Trump himself. Environment | The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can no longer be considered a low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic impact. In depth: ‘Palestinian narrative is being erased’ After stepping down as UK prime minister in 2007, Tony Blair served as the UN Middle East envoy until 2015. He spent years visiting Jerusalem pushing for a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, but there was no resolution, nor any meaningful development towards a Palestinian state. Details of the plans being discussed by Blair, the US and Israeli officials remain scarce for now. The far right in Israel remains animated by a proposal announced in February, weeks after Donald Trump was elected, in which the US president effectively called for Gaza to be ethnically cleansed, the land seized by the US, and an international resort built. The “Gaza Riviera” plan was widely condemned, including by western-backed Arab allies. Trump has been a lot quieter on this plan since. In July, reports emerged that Blair’s thinktank worked with a project developing a postwar Gaza plan that included the creation of a “Trump Riviera” and a manufacturing zone named after Elon Musk. The project was led by Israeli business people using financial models developed by the US firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) said it was not involved in the authorship of the plan but two staff members took part in calls as the project evolved. BCG has distanced itself significantly from the work in Gaza, reportedly firing two partners who it said had misled senior management. “There is not a single Palestinian at the table” in these reported discussions, Ubai Al-Aboudi told me, “whether it’s the Palestinian political leadership or representatives of Palestinian civil society and the wider Palestinian communities.” He added: “This is colonial practice. Palestinians must decide their own governance and future. But instead, while we are being genocided, the same powers complicit in the genocide are planning our future.” *** What Palestinians want Al-Aboudi dismissed Blair not only as a war criminal who must answer for the horrors that unfolded in Iraq, but for his role as the Middle Eastern envoy, “which failed in reining in Israel’s policies of fragmentation, of, increased settlement activity, increased human rights violations against Palestinians, increased economic dependency of Palestinians”. From the early days of the war in Gaza, Palestinian civil society has emphasised that any governance or rebuilding must have Palestinian agency at its core, Al-Aboudi explained, which factors in Palestinian cultural, historical, and socioeconomic heritage. “It should take into account that 80% of the people living in Gaza, for example, are refugees whose fathers and grandfathers were ethnically cleansed from their villages back in 1948. It should take into account that there should be unity between the West Bank and Gaza, and it should take into account that the Israeli system of control over Palestinians cannot continue and should not be allowed or maintained. No Israeli should have a say or a call on the future of any Palestinian; this should be the number one lesson from this genocide,” Al-Aboudi said. “What’s happening right now is totally different. Palestinian voices are being totally ignored. The Palestinian narrative is being erased.” He said Palestinian civil society embraced the Egypt plan for Gaza, which was backed by the Arab league and Europe, which would rebuild Gaza and support Palestinian technocrats, operating under the management of the Palestinian Authority (PA), to take over Gaza’s governance. The plan, which includes elections, would eventually lead to Gaza and the West Bank coming together as part of a Palestinian state. “We have called for … a democratically elected leadership that would guide our people towards freedom … that would lift up our people. Unfortunately, all of these calls have fallen on deaf ears, whether from the international community or the US,” Al-Aboudi said. *** The denial of Palestinian autonomy Life for Palestinians in the West Bank means being trapped between a rock and a hard place: the Israeli occupation on one side and a Palestinian Authority that works with it on the other. Al-Aboudi’s organisation, Bisan, works to secure socioeconomic rights for Palestinians and to advocate on their behalf “not just against Israeli occupation but also the Palestinian Authority and big business when they violate people’s rights”. “Our work has put us in the crosshairs of everyone. I’ve been arrested by both Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian Authority. Our organisation has been targeted, but we’re still operational, pushing for the basic right of Palestinians to live in dignity.” But even the western-backed PA, widely criticised by many Palestinians for its role in working closely with the Israeli occupation, has been excluded from discussions about Gaza’s future. That’s largely down to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli ministers who have firmly ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza. “What we have now is a propped-up dictator, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected in 2005 for a four-year period that has now stretched for more than 20 years. He has been kept in power by outside support, not popular support. And now, even this propped-up leadership is not being consulted on what kind of leadership or governance should exist; let alone … the Palestinian community itself, the people who are going through the genocide right now,” Al-Aboudi said. *** The work continues For Al-Aboudi, the denial of Palestinian agency has been a process that has unfolded over many decades. In 2021, Israel designated Bisan Centre and five other human rights organisations in the occupied territories as terrorists. This was widely rebuffed by the international community. “Israel has always worked to stifle any kind of Palestinian agency … We have always been subjected to Israeli harassment.” But he explained that the sucker punch was landed when the Israeli government designated Bisan under the same label as al-Qaida and Islamic State. “Can you imagine that? Civil society organisations that write reports, provide aid for people, provide legal counselling, communicate to the world, to the UN, what is happening here, are being treated in the same way as IS?” Al-Aboudi said. Yet the work continues. “We believe in every human being in the world. We believe in equality, we believe in dignity, and we believe our people deserve it like any other people around the world.” With the Palestinians living amid one of their darkest chapters in their history, I asked Al-Aboudi why he still holds on to hope. “This is the only thing that keeps us going … When we see millions of people on the streets of London or Manchester, or in Sydney, Australia … this gives us hope. We know that righteousness is on our side. We know that the people of the world feel for what we are going through,” he said. And, he added, that regardless of what is being planned in backrooms, he ultimately believes that political agency will, at the end of the day, lie with the people. “The people have the power, and the people can claim back their political agency from corrupt governments and businesses.” What else we’ve been reading Patrick Greenfield has a fascinating look at the genuinely serious work of tackling invasive hornets threatening UK pollinators.

After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete picture of the event. This documentary series on iPlayer, copes with the challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform’s layout to give us the fullest picture possible. The shocking story is skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors’ words, as the actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their experience. Jack Seale Music Blood Orange: Essex Honey | ★★★★★ This is an exquisitely eclectic portrait of grief. It combines gorgeous melodies with dancefloor rhythms, indie pop and languorous funk – and cameos from Lorde and Zadie Smith. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy: there’s a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes’s mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London’s urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on countryside. Alexis Petridis Film In the Nguyen Kitchen | ★★★★☆ In this heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to the magic of the musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the struggles of Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen on screen. A hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier) can’t help but dream in songs. Without much luck getting cast in acting roles, Yvonne moves back in with her mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant in the outskirts of Paris. This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in an industry where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Phuong Le Theatre Juniper Blood (Donmar Warehouse, London) | ★★★☆☆ Mike Bartlett’s invigorating play is a drama about whether it is possible to live responsibly in our age of toxic capitalism. It begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation play. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll? Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and ambitious. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter.

45) Germany, France push for secondary sanctions on Russia amid Ukraine war — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     European Union’s two biggest economies have agreed to push for measures targeting companies from third countries that support Russia’s war.
     German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron have called for secondary sanctions aimed at disrupting Russia’s war in Ukraine after holding the 25th Franco-German Council of Ministers, with US President Donald Trump’s diplomatic push yet to bring the three-and-a-half-year war to an end.
     The leaders of Europe’s two biggest economies on Friday agreed to accelerate measures targeting Russia’s war machine, including “companies from third countries that support Russia’s war”, according to a joint statement after the meeting in the southern French port city of Toulon.
     Both countries also agreed to send additional air defence hardware to Ukraine, a day after the deadliest Russian attack on Kyiv in months, and to open a strategic dialogue about nuclear deterrence. Russian missiles and drones ripped through apartment blocks in Kyiv on Thursday, killing at least 23 people, including four children and wounding approximately 50 others.
     The moves came as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict sparked by Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of its neighbour appear to have lost steam after Trump moved to restore dialogue with Moscow at the start of his second presidency.
     Macron expressed hope that a long-awaited meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy would eventually take place, as Putin committed to do in conversations with Trump earlier this month.
     But he added that if the Russian leader did not meet a Monday deadline to agree to the talks, “It will show again President Putin has played President Trump.”
     Merz added that it looked like Putin was “unwilling” to hold such a meeting and said that the war looked like it would last “many more months”.
     He promised that “we will not abandon Ukraine” but said it looked like Putin was showing “no readiness” to meet Zelenskyy.
     “To be frank, that does not surprise me as this is part of this Russian president’s strategy,” Merz said.
     France’s Macron showed no regret for describing Putin in an interview last week as an “ogre at our gates”, in comments that angered Moscow.
     “We say there is an ogre at the gates of Europe … this is very much what the Georgians [after a 2008 invasion] and Ukrainians and many other nations feel very deeply,” he said.
     “That is a man who has decided to go down an authoritarian path and impose imperialism to change international frontiers.”
     Macron also warned that Putin had a habit of saying one thing at international talks and then acting differently.
     “The gap between President Putin’s positions at international summits and the reality on the ground shows how insincere he is,” he said.
     Russia said on Friday that Macron had spoken in a manner unbecoming of a head of state. Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow that Macron was constantly making strange statements that sometimes crossed the line of decency and turned into “low-grade insults”.

46) Russia, China slam European nations over Iran ‘snapback’ sanctions move — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     Russia said it ‘strongly condemns’ actions of Germany, France and UK as China says sanctions move ‘counterproductive’.
     Russia and China have condemned a decision by Britain, Germany and France to launch a process that could reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.
     The three European countries, known as the E3, launched the so-called “ snapback mechanism ” on Thursday over accusations that Iran has violated a 2015 deal that aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapons capability in return for the lifting of international sanctions.
     The move opens a 30-day window during which a new UN resolution to continue sanctions relief must be adopted to prevent penalties from being reimposed.
     “We strongly condemn these actions by European countries and call on the international community to reject them,” the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday in a statement that blamed the United States and the Europeans for the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal.
     China said the move by the European countries was “not constructive”.
     “The Iranian nuclear issue is at a critical juncture. Launching the Security Council’s snapback mechanism of sanctions is not constructive and will undermine the process of a political and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular media briefing on Friday.
     Iran earlier decried the move, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying it was “unjustified” and “lacking any legal basis” in a call with his European counterparts.
     “The Islamic Republic of Iran will respond appropriately to this unlawful and unwarranted measure,” he said. Hours later, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move by the European countries will “gravely undermine” its ongoing cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog agency.
     France, Germany, and the UK’s ambassadors to the UN said on Friday that, in order to avoid sanctions, Iran should restore access for UN nuclear inspectors, address concerns about enriched uranium stocks, and begin talks with the US
     But Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said the E3’s requirements were “full of unrealistic preconditions”.
     Iranian MP Hossein-Ali Haji-Deligani told the Tasnim news agency that the parliament is planning legislation that would take the country out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in response to the European move .
     The treaty has been a cornerstone of global nuclear arms control for decades.
     “The draft law is on the agenda and will undergo the legal review and approval process next week,” the MP told the agency, adding that given the possible reimplementation of UN sanctions, further nuclear negotiations with the West would no longer make sense.
     The only option, he said, would be to completely sever ties with the European trio.
     Iran says it needs nuclear energy for power, but the West has long feared it is trying to build an atomic bomb.
     US President Donald Trump, who unilaterally took the US out of the 2015 deal in his first term, said he believed it was not sufficiently curtailing Iranian nuclear ambitions.
     Tehran has repeatedly threatened to exit the NPT in the past.

47) UK bans Israeli officials from major arms exhibition — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

     UK government says Israel’s decision to escalate war on Gaza ‘wrong’ as Israel decries ‘discrimination’.
     The British government has barred Israeli officials from attending a major London arms fair next month, as tensions between the two allies escalate over Israel’s war on Gaza .
     “We can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025,” the Ministry of Defence said in a statement reported by the AFP news agency on Friday.
     The biennial exhibition, running from September 9-12, is one of the world’s largest arms trade shows.
     The decision follows London’s suspension of some weapons export licences to Israel, the freezing of free trade negotiations , and sanctions imposed on two far-right Israeli ministers over the assault on Gaza, where famine has taken hold amid Israel’s severe restrictions on supplies of humanitarian aid.
     “The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong,” the British statement said. “There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.”
     A report published in May found that United Kingdom firms have continued to export military items to Israel despite a government partial suspension in September last year.
     Israeli defence companies will still be permitted to take part in the event, but without an official government presence or pavilion.
     Israel’s defence ministry denounced the move as “a deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination” and said it would withdraw from the exhibition entirely.
     Israeli media reported that Britain had said the ban could be reversed if Israel committed to “upholding international law in the occupied Palestinian territories”.
     The move comes amid mounting European pressure on Israel over its continued war on Gaza.
     In May, France barred Israeli arms manufacturers from displaying “offensive weapons” at the Paris Air Show.
     European Union foreign ministers are set to discuss further sanctions against Israel at a meeting in Copenhagen on Saturday, with Sweden and the Netherlands leading calls for tougher action.
     British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signalled a harder stance towards Israel, pledging last month to recognise a Palestinian state in September if Israel refuses to agree to a truce and take concrete steps towards ending its occupation.
     The DSEI arms fair traditionally hosts senior delegations alongside private arms contractors.
     More than 62,600 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed by Israel in its nearly two-year war on Gaza and at least 157,600 have been wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities.
     South Africa has brought a case at the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was in breach of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The case alleges that Israel’s war on Gaza has gone beyond targeting the Palestinian group Hamas, with the military attacking civilians, schools, hospitals and camps. Israel denies deliberately targeting civilians.

48) How triggering snapback sanctions may deepen Iran nuclear crisis — Al Jazeera (2025-08-29)

     Europe’s move to re-impose UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme will make diplomacy more difficult, experts say.
     By Ali Harb
     Washington, DC – The decision by European countries to impose “snapback” sanctions against Iran may further exacerbate international tensions , experts say, as fears of a regional war loom over the Middle East.
     On Thursday, Germany, France and the United Kingdom – Europe’s largest economies – triggered a 30-day process to reimpose sanctions over what they called “significant” violations of a 2015 agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear programme.
     “What we’re heading toward is the snapback scenario where the sanctions come back and Iran is likely to retaliate in some way that’s unhelpful,” said Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC).
     And the tensions could escalate into renewed violence after the Israeli attacks on Iran earlier this year. “It’s another kind of domino falling on the way toward the June war reigniting,” Costello said.
     The United States, which bombed three nuclear facilities in June as part of an Israeli assault on Iran, has welcomed the European countries’ move.
     But the administration of US President Donald Trump has also kept the door open for talks with Iran.
     “The United States remains available for direct engagement with Iran – in furtherance of a peaceful, enduring resolution to the Iran nuclear issue,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. “Snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it.”
     Costello, however, underscored that Iran was at the table before Israel launched its 12-day war.
     A round of nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials was set to take place on June 15. But Israeli bombs started falling on Tehran two days before the scheduled negotiations, postponing them indefinitely.
     Costello said that, in order to return to the nuclear discussions, the US and Europe first have to rebuild trust with Iran.
     “The overwhelming sentiment in Iran is that those talks were all a ruse – that Israel was going to attack Iran with US support to some degree regardless of what they did at the negotiating table,” he told Al Jazeera. “So both the Europeans and the US have to reflect that reality.”
     The current crisis can be traced back to Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during his first term in 2018.
     The 2015 accord – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – compelled Iran to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting international sanctions against its economy.
     But to ensure that Iran can be penalised quickly if it violates the agreement, the deal included a “snapback” mechanism to reimpose a series of United Nations sanctions.
     The mechanism gave any signatory to the agreement – the US, UK, Germany, France, Russia or China – the power to kickstart a process to revive six UN Security Council sanctions resolutions.
     And the snapback is veto-proof, meaning Russia and China, both allies of Iran, cannot block the restoration of the sanctions.
     In 2020, the US tried to activate the snapback clause of the JCPOA, but the effort failed because Washington was no longer a party in the agreement.
     Since the US exit in 2018, Iran has been gradually escalating its nuclear programme, but Iranian officials insist that the country is not seeking a nuclear weapon.
     Thursday’s decision to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran appears to be timed against the expiration of the snapback provision in October, which marks 10 years after the nuclear deal came into effect.
     Experts say the governments in Paris, London and Berlin are essentially invoking a provision from a long-abandoned agreement to secure UN sanctions against Iran.
     Sina Toossi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said the snapback was included in the JCPOA to ensure that all sides abide by the deal, but European powers are using it to further pressure Iran.
     “The overall US and European approach to Iran has been just brute power – like might is right,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.
     “Anything about legal contacts and history and international norms doesn’t matter. They just want to use this instrument to unilaterally reimpose sanctions on Iran.”
     France, Germany and the UK, however, have outlined three conditions to delay the snapback sanctions by six months.
     The demands are for Iran to resume direct talks with the US, restore full cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, and disclose the new location for its heavily enriched uranium after the US and Israeli strikes.
     Some US reports have suggested that the uranium stockpiles are buried under the now-damaged nuclear facilities, but Iran may have also moved the material before the US bombed its nuclear sites.
     Analysts say that, while the European conditions may seem reasonable on the surface, they are challenging for the Iranian leadership to agree to.
     The European powers want Tehran to recommit to negotiations with Washington, without assurances from the US and Israel that they wouldn’t attack again.
     Tehran had also suspended full cooperation with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after the watchdog failed to condemn the US and Israeli attacks, which it said breached international law.
     Earlier this month, Iran allowed some IAEA inspectors back into the country, but the UN agency still has not accessed or assessed the damage at Iran’s enrichment facilities.
     As for the uranium, Iran fears that disclosing the location of the stockpiles will only invite Israel or the US to bomb them.
     “If they make the location of that enriched uranium very clearly known to the wider world, including US and Israel, then it’s a blinking target for follow-up US or Israeli strikes on those facilities to set Iran’s programme back further,” Costello told Al Jazeera.
     “So because that hasn’t been ruled out, it becomes very difficult for Iran to strike such an agreement.”
     But the three European powers argued that the demands are necessary because Iran’s nuclear programme constitutes a “clear threat to international peace and security”.
     “Today, Iran’s non-compliance with the JCPOA is clear and deliberate, and sites of major proliferation concern in Iran are outside of IAEA monitoring,” the countries said in a statement.
     “Iran has no civilian justification for its high enriched uranium stockpile … which is also unaccounted for by the IAEA.”
     Tehran has rejected that argument, saying that European powers had breached the 2015 agreement first by accepting the US’s 2018 decision to restore secondary sanctions on Iran’s economy.
     Most countries and businesses around the world enforce US sanctions out of fear of being sanctioned themselves.
     The Iranian economy is already reeling under heavy US sanctions with global implications.
     But the UN sanctions – which include an arms embargo – could enable unilateral sanctions by other countries. They may also further undermine trust in the Iranian economy. Already, the Iranian rial fell sharply after Thursday’s announcement.
     “There is more currency depreciation because of the snapback; it’s another psychological shock to the economy,” said Toossi.
     Since the turn of the 21st century, European countries have been seen as a moderating influence on Washington’s hawkish impulses towards Iran.
     Despite abiding by the US sanctions, European leaders had vocally opposed Trump’s exit from the JCPOA in 2018.
     But since Trump returned to office in January, France, Germany and the UK appear to have taken a harder line against Tehran.
     In June, European powers not only failed to condemn Israel’s unprovoked war on Iran, but they also seemed to endorse it. Chancellor Friedrich Merz even suggested Germany and the West are benefitting from the assault.
     “This is dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us,” he said .
     Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Europe’s new posture towards Iran is linked to its broader relationship with the US.
     Iran has been accused of supplying Russia with drones to use in its war against Ukraine , so now Europe sees Tehran as a threat, Parsi said.
     He also noted that nearly all trade between Europe and Iran has been destroyed by US sanctions.
     “Iran simply does not matter that much for Europeans,” he told Al Jazeera in a TV interview.
     “So doing something that endears Europe with the hardline elements in the Trump administration, I think, is something that is seen as valuable in Europe … given how tremendously strained the current transatlantic relationship is right now.”
     For now, the nuclear tensions continue to grind on. The US continues to demand that Iran dismantle its nuclear programme, while Tehran insists on maintaining uranium enrichment domestically.
     Toossi said there’s an irony in the whole affair: The three European powers are invoking a provision of the JCPOA that grants Iran the right to uranium enrichment, but they are using it to align with the US demand for no more enrichment.
     “The hypocrisies and contradictions are just immense in all of this,” he said.

49) Noah Lyles makes it six in a row with thrilling 200m win in Diamond League final — The Guardian (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/28/noah-lyles-makes-it-six-in-a-row-with-thrilling-200m-win-in-diamond-league-final
   Text:
     Noah Lyles laid down a hefty marker for next month’s World Athletics Championships by winning a thrilling 200m rematch against Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in the Diamond League final in Zurich. Tebogo sprung a major surprise at last year’s Olympics by beating Lyles, who it later turned out had Covid. It looked as if a repeat was on the cards as Tebogo led from the gun but in the final strides the American finally got his vest in front to take victory – and the $30,000 (£22,000) prize – in 19.74sec, with Tebogo 0.02 back in second. It was a much-needed confidence booster for Lyles after two recent defeats in the 100m, as he took his sixth Diamond League final win. “Six in a row, the most in track!” said Lyles. “It is pretty nice to have that. I saw Letsile lean on the finish line but I knew I won. I knew if I panicked I was not going to win. If you are tight you are done for.” Elsewhere it was a good night for British athletes as Max Burgin nearly took down the men’s Olympic 800m champion and Georgia Hunter Bell ran a personal best in the women’s 800m. Burgin has long been compared to Sebastian Coe, but a series of injuries has left the 23-year-old unable to fulfil his potential. But he will gain immense confidence slugging it out with Emmanuel Wanyonyi before finishing in 1min 42.42sec, his second quickest time. “Today was a bit of a world championships field, like a test,” said Burgin, who was just 0.05 behind Wanyonyi in second. “I am dreaming of being at the exact same position at the worlds.” Hunter Bell was just as impressive as she weaved her way from fifth to second in the final 200m to finish in 1:55.96 – a career-best time by half a second and the third fastest time in British history, behind her training partner Keely Hodgkinson and Jemma Reekie. However the Briton, who has opted to run the 800m rather than the 1500m in Tokyo, was unable to get past the young Swiss star Audrey Werro, who delighted the home fans to win in 1:55.91. Sebastian Coe has said World Athletics’ decision to introduce mandatory female sex-verification testing last month has now been “overwhelmingly” backed by athletes. The World Athletics president acknowledged that there had been challenges with getting everyone tested in time for the world championships in Tokyo in September, but revealed that over 90% of competitors had now undergone the cheek-swab SRY gene test. “First of all, the athletes are overwhelmingly supportive of this, and have been very, very helpful in all this,” he said. “And the member federations have also been very, very supportive. “The objective is to make sure that by the time we have the championships the athletes will have all been tested. The time frame was tight. And it wasn’t without its challenges. But there will be athletes that will be tested, even in their holding camps in Tokyo. We’re hitting slightly more than 90% now.” The SRY gene reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is the indicator of biological sex. The test was also approved by World Boxing when it introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers. Coe acknowledged that some competitors had struggled to get tested, with the broadcaster CBC in Canada quoting an unnamed athlete saying they had to drive five hours to get a test. But he said that such cases were unusual, and those who hadn’t yet been tested would have the cheek-swab test when they arrived in Japan. “By and large the process has gone pretty smoothly, but it’s not been without its challenges,” he said. “France has its own national laws around it, so many of their athletes have been tested outside of the country. And those that haven’t been yet will be tested in their holding camps in Japan. But the vast majority have been pretty straightforward.”

52) Manchester United agree £40m fee with Chelsea for sale of Alejandro Garnacho — The Guardian (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/28/christopher-nkunku-milan-chelsea
   Text:
     Manchester United have agreed to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea for £40m plus a 10% sell-on fee. The 21-year-old Argentina international has been training away from the first-team squad since the start of the summer after a breakdown in his relationship with Ruben Amorim, the head coach. It is understood Chelsea offered an initial £25m before the final fixed fee was agreed. It will be United’s highest-value player sale for five years and the club’s fourth-highest-value sale ever. Only Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di María have left United for a higher price. Due to the winger’s wish to leave, United view the deal as a positive step. Garnacho scored 26 goals in 144 appearances for United after joining the academy setup from Atlético Madrid in 2020 for around £400,000. While Garnacho is heading to Stamford Bridge, Christopher Nkunku is moving away, with Milan poised to sign the forward for a package worth €42m (£36.2m). The deal contains a sell-on clause for the France international, who has agreed personal terms with the Serie A club. Chelsea are also interested in Barcelona’s Fermín López and RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Tottenham, however, have held talks with Leipzig over Simons, who flew to London on Wednesday, and are primed to make a bid. Spurs are determined to sign a No 10 after failing with moves for Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze – and with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski out with long-term injuries. They hope to close a deal for Simons, who Leipzig are keen to sell as they restructure their squad. Leipzig value Simons at €70m (£60.5m), although they may accept a little less because time is tight before Monday’s deadline and they want to push ahead with a bid for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott. He remains close to Jürgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager, who is the head of football at Red Bull. Spurs had a conversation about Simons earlier in the summer but at the time his representatives indicated that if he left Leipzig he would only want to join Chelsea, who had made inquiries. It is understood Chelsea wanted to include one of their players in any move for Simons but this did not appeal to Leipzig, with most of them too expensive in terms of wages. Leipzig have sought to cap the basic annual salaries of their new signings at €5m, albeit they can earn more via performance-related add-ons. Simons is the club’s top earner on a basic €11m a year. Leipzig were one of the teams pushing for Nkunku, who left the Bundesliga side for £52m in 2023. The 27-year-old has struggled for form and fitness at Chelsea. He picked up a knee injury during his first pre-season and was unable to build momentum. He had a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca last season, although he made contributions to Chelsea winning the Club World Cup this summer. Bayern Munich held talks over Nkunku but were interested only in a loan. Chelsea wanted a permanent sale. Chelsea’s position is slightly different on Nicolas Jackson, who may be allowed to go on loan if the deal contains an obligation to buy. Bayern, Aston Villa, Napoli, Juventus and Newcastle are tracking the 24-year-old striker. Chelsea are prepared to wait to see how the Alexander Isak situation plays out at Newcastle before committing to a final decision on Jackson, who is likely to be reintegrated in Maresca’s squad if he stays. Roma, Leipzig and a host of English sides are monitoring the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George.

53) Judges to rule on Epping hotel injunction on Friday – as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-28)

     This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates and commenting below the line. You can read our story on the Epping Hotel court case here: You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: Three senior judges will rule on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is set to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, at 2pm on Friday. The Home Office and Somani Hotels, which owns the site, are attempting to challenge a High Court judge’s decision last week to issue an interim injunction to Epping Forest District Council that will stop dozens of asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel beyond 12 September. The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites, or face deeper worldwide economic isolation. UK officials said the decision had not been taken lightly and there had been very intensive diplomacy to try to avert this step. In a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France and Germany, David Lammy said that Iran’s non-compliance with a 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear programme was “clear and deliberate”. The statement said that Iran has exceeded limits on enriched uranium imposed by the deal, and restricted the ability of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor its nuclear programme. A member of the House of Lords asked a senior British diplomat to help a Ghanaian goldmining venture in which he held shares, claiming that it was “in the UK national interest”, the Guardian can disclose. The revelation will add to concerns about apparent breaches of parliamentary lobbying rules by Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army. The peer is already under scrutiny over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases to investigations by the Lords’ standards body. The first session of parliament will run until Spring 2026, the government has announced. The session, which began in July last year after Labour won the election, could run to nearly two years long as a result of the announcement. Sessions of parliament usually last for around a year, but ministers are hoping to progress as many pieces of legislation into law before the current one ends. Chemical firms are lobbying MPs not to ban “forever chemicals” in the same way as proposed in the EU, using arguments disputed by scientists and described as “Big Tobacco playbook” tactics, it can be revealed. Pfas, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and commonly known as forever chemicals owing to their persistence in the environment, are a family of about 10,000 chemicals, some of which have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses, including certain cancers. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will boycott King Charles’s state banquet held in honour of Donald Trump to protest against the US president’s failure to intervene decisively to end the war in Gaza. Davey, who is invited to the dinner for Trump’s state visit to the UK, said to turn down an invitation from the king went against all his instincts and that it was a deeply serious move to refuse to attend. The Reform MSP who defected from the Tories this week should stand down, first minister John Swinney has said, reports the PA news agency. Graham Simpson announced the move at a press conference alongside Reform UK leader Nigel Farage on Wednesday. A former Labour councillor in Glasgow who quit the party after being accused of making racist remarks has joined Reform UK, making her the seventeenth Scottish councillor to defect to them. Reform UK announced on Thursday morning that Audrey Dempsey, who now sits as an independent on Glasgow city council, had become its latest elected member. A Reform council leader’s decision to ban his councillors from engaging with a prominent local newspaper is a “massive attack on local democracy” and a sign of things to come should the party form the next government, the outlet’s editor has warned. In an unprecedented move, Nottinghamshire county council’s four-month-old Reform administration has said it will no longer deal with the Nottingham Post, its online edition and a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that it manages. Children and young people are being overdiagnosed with mental health conditions in a society that has lost sight of the reality that child development is “messy and uneven”, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. He is the latest senior figure to add his voice to calls for a radical overhaul of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system in England. Keir Starmer has begun a shake-up of No 10, including replacing an aide whose appointment had been a key battleground amid the departure of Sue Gray last autumn. Nin Pandit, the prime minister’s top civil service aide, is to leave her role after less than 10 months. Sources at No 10 denied she had quit and said she would step into a new policy delivery role and the prime minister would now take more direct control of delivery. Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a remit to challenge government thinking. Greg Jackson has joined the Cabinet Office board, an influential core of government advisers, as a non-executive member. Trade minister Douglas Alexander will promote the UK as an economic partner during a visit to Japan and South Korea, starting on Thursday. According to the PA news agency, in Japan, Alexander will give a speech at the Pacific Future forum, declaring that the UK is open for business and can be an indispensable partner in upholding global order. Former prime minister Liz Truss has appeared on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to give her views on the current economic situation in the UK. Asked whether she would join Reform, she said she was “not really thinking about party politics at the moment because my whole experience of being in government was that the power was not in the hands of the politicians”. The Conservatives have accused the government of prioritising illegal migrants over local people with its Epping asylum seeker injunction challenge. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: “This has been a day of shame for Labour. The Home Office instructed their lawyers to argue that the rights of illegal immigrants claiming asylum are more important than those of local people. “Given that young girls have reported being sexually assaulted by middle aged immigrants from the hotel, this is appalling. When will this government stand up for our country, instead of prioritising people who entered illegally?” He claimed that “this border crisis and public safety crisis for women and girls seems set to get worse and worse”. Data out last week shows that the current government is processing asylum applications much more quickly than the previous administration, with 71,000 cases awaiting approval, relating to 91,000 people, compared with 134,000 two years ago. While the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year, according to Home Office data, that is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of September 2023 under the Tories. In case you missed it earlier, the UK and European Union have summoned their Russian envoys after overnight missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and damaged the city’s British Council and EU offices in the most deadly aerial assault on the Ukrainian capital since the Alaska summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Four children are among the 17 reported dead after a residential building was struck in the middle of the night within the eastern Darnytskyi district, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko. Hours later, another person was killed in a separate blast in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district, which left the buildings and offices – including those housing the EU delegation to Ukraine and the British Council – severely damaged. The incident marks the first time British government property has been caught up in a Russian attack since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. GPS tagging of criminals leaving prison has led to a drop in the rate of reoffending, according to a study. A Ministry of Justice pilot scheme, which targeted male offenders who committed burglary, theft and robbery, suggested that forcing criminals to wear the tracking devices on release from prison meant they were less likely to commit further offences. Under the scheme, criminals’ movements were monitored and mapped against scenes of recent unsolved burglaries and theft, and then any matches were shared with police during their investigations. The project found male prison leavers involved in the study were associated with a drop in the rate of reoffending within 12 months of release by seven percentage points, from 33.2% to 26.2%. The study also detailed the average number of reoffences per offender fell by 0.35, from 1.04 to 0.69 over the same period. Prisons minister James Timpson said: The evidence is clear that tagging works, acting as a constant reminder to thieves and burglars that we are watching their every move and will know if they reoffend. We are increasing the use of tagging as part of our Plan for Change to toughen punishment, prevent crime and make our streets safer. A member of the House of Lords asked a senior British diplomat to help a Ghanaian goldmining venture in which he held shares, claiming that it was “in the UK national interest”, the Guardian can disclose. The revelation will add to concerns about apparent breaches of parliamentary lobbying rules by Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army. The peer is already under scrutiny over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases to investigations by the Lords’ standards body. Lord Dannatt, an unpaid senior adviser to Blue International, sought help from the high commissioner for Ghana in January 2024 on behalf of the company’s Ghanaian subsidiary, Future Global Resources. The latest disclosure raises new questions about whether the peer breached parliamentary rules by seeking diplomatic assistance for the investment firm, which is focused on west Africa. At the time, the company was facing financial difficulties at its Bogoso-Prestea mine and was at risk of losing the right to operate the mine, by far its largest asset. Documents disclosed under freedom of information laws show that on 22 January 2024 Dannatt wrote to Harriet Thompson, then high commissioner for Ghana, seeking her help. Foreign secretary David Lammy said that the UK, alongside European allies, has “negotiated in good faith” with Iran since 2019, but they are now “left with no choice” but to reintroduce sanctions. He said: “Alongside my French and German counterparts, I have today written to the UN security council announcing that we have triggered the snapback mechanism which will end sanctions relief against Iran. “Iran’s nuclear programme remains a threat to global peace and security. Over the past six years, Iran has broken almost all limits in the JCPOA and its stockpile of enriched uranium is 45-times over the JCPOA limit. “Alongside our European allies, the UK has negotiated in good faith since 2019, when Iran began to disregard the nuclear deal. We supported a viable deal in 2022, which Iran rejected, and recently offered an extension to sanctions relief, subject to Iran meeting set conditions. “However, despite repeated warnings, Iran has made no substantive effort to meet the conditions of our extension offer and has consistently failed to provide credible assurances on the nature of its nuclear programme. “Whilst we have been left with no choice but to take this action, the ball remains in Iran’s court and I would welcome their return to the table with a serious offer.” Three senior judges will rule on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is set to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, at 2pm on Friday. The Home Office and Somani Hotels, which owns the site, are attempting to challenge a High Court judge’s decision last week to issue an interim injunction to Epping Forest District Council that will stop dozens of asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel beyond 12 September. The government is also seeking to appeal against Justice Eyre’s decision not to allow it to intervene in the case, while the council opposes the appeal bids, PA reports. At the end of a hearing on Thursday, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said that they would hand down their judgement on Friday afternoon. He said: “Because of the great urgency of this matter, we will aim to give judgement at 2pm tomorrow.” He continued: “If it proves impractical for us to meet the deadline, we will let people know in advance.” Concluding his submissions on behalf of the Home Office, Edward Brown KC said that Epping Forest district council has “effectively conceded” that the injunction “was in truth only ever about protests”. He continued that the injunction had not stopped protests taking place around asylum seeker accommodation and was “simply the wrong tool for doing so”. In his closing submissions, Piers Riley-Smith, for Somani Hotels, which owns the Bell hotel, said the injunction “robbed” the company of the “ability for dialogue” with the authority. He also said that there were “other and more appropriate” solutions to the council’s concerns. Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said they would leave the courtroom briefly. He said: What we need to discuss is when we will be in a position to give a judgment. In a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France and Germany, David Lammy said that Iran’s non-compliance with a 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear programme was “clear and deliberate”. The statement said that Iran has exceeded limits on enriched uranium imposed by the deal, and restricted the ability of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor its nuclear programme. It read: Iran has no civilian justification for its high enriched uranium stockpile – now over nine significant quantities – which is also unaccounted for by the IAEA. Its nuclear programme therefore remains a clear threat to international peace and security. Lammy said that the UK, alongside European allies, has “negotiated in good faith” with Iran since 2019, but they are now “left with no choice” but to reintroduce sanctions. He said: Alongside my French and German counterparts, I have today written to the UN security council announcing that we have triggered the snapback mechanism which will end sanctions relief against Iran. Iran’s nuclear programme remains a threat to global peace and security. Over the past six years, Iran has broken almost all limits in the JCPOA and its stockpile of enriched uranium is 45-times over the JCPOA limit. Alongside our European allies, the UK has negotiated in good faith since 2019, when Iran began to disregard the nuclear deal. We supported a viable deal in 2022, which Iran rejected, and recently offered an extension to sanctions relief, subject to Iran meeting set conditions. However, despite repeated warnings, Iran has made no substantive effort to meet the conditions of our extension offer and has consistently failed to provide credible assurances on the nature of its nuclear programme. Whilst we have been left with no choice but to take this action, the ball remains in Iran’s court and I would welcome their return to the table with a serious offer. The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites, or face deeper worldwide economic isolation. UK officials said the decision had not been taken lightly and there had been very intensive diplomacy to try to avert this step. The officials stressed there was still room for some last-ditch diplomacy before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force in 30 days’ time. The annual high-level UN general assembly in September is likely to see intensive diplomacy over how to handle Iran. They added that Iran had been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity to make itself compliant, but had either been unwilling or politically unable to act. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) quit Iran after Israel bombed Iran’s key nuclear sites, and has been unable as yet to renegotiate a return to assess the state of those sites. Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the Bushehr site where refuelling is due to occur. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, informed the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the move by the three European countries in a call on Thursday morning and British officials are expecting a sharp Iranian reaction. The effect of the snapback will convert many existing, largely US and European, sanctions into UN-wide sanctions requiring observance by Russia and China. Some sanctions on the Iranian arms industry that are not currently in force will be restored. In addition, the US, as a permanent member of the UN securitycouncil, will in future have a veto over the lifting of the UN sanctions, a power it currently does not have. The first session of parliament will run until Spring 2026, the government has announced. The session, which began in July last year after Labour won the election, could run to nearly two years long as a result of the announcement. Sessions of parliament usually last for around a year, but ministers are hoping to progress as many pieces of legislation into law before the current one ends. Commons leader Lucy Powell said: By any measure, this is a bumper first parliamentary session delivering on the government’s plan for change. No new incoming government has set out such an ambitious legislative programme in its first year, that delivers for working people. We said we would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, put power and opportunity back into the hands of people and take on the vested interests holding us back – and that’s what we are doing. This autumn is going to be a busy term for parliamentarians. Setting up GB Energy, stopping water bosses’ bonuses, new rights for workers and renters, public ownership of rail, better buses, protecting local football clubs, saving British steel, planning reform for new homes, new police powers to tackle antisocial behaviour and strengthening our borders are just some of the real change we’re delivering so far. Robin Green, for Epping Forest district council, told the court of appeal that the authority had not previously taken enforcement action against Somani Hotels over the use of the Bell hotel in Epping to house asylum seekers because it had been “unproblematic”. The hotel has housed single adult male asylum seekers since April 2025, and from October 2022 to April 2024. It had also accommodated asylum seekers from May 2020 to March 2021, but this year marked the first time the council had taken enforcement action when it issued legal proceedings earlier this month. According to the PA news agency, Green told the court that enforcement action had not been taken before because previous periods of the hotel being used as asylum seeker accommodation were “tolerable”. Green said: A decision not to take enforcement action at one point in time does not mean it cannot take a different decision at a later point in time if circumstances change. On the evidence, circumstances had undoubtedly changed. Chemical firms are lobbying MPs not to ban “forever chemicals” in the same way as proposed in the EU, using arguments disputed by scientists and described as “Big Tobacco playbook” tactics, it can be revealed. Pfas, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and commonly known as forever chemicals owing to their persistence in the environment, are a family of about 10,000 chemicals, some of which have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses, including certain cancers. They are used across multiple industries, from cosmetics to firefighting. In May, MPs on the environmental audit committee (EAC) launched an inquiry into Pfas, with a call for evidence on the uses and risks of the substances, and options for how to regulate them. Exclusive analysis by the Ends Report and the Guardian of the responses submitted to the parliamentary committee has revealed major chemical producers, from UK-based companies to large US corporations, urging parliamentarians that any incoming UK Pfas regulation should be more limited than that currently proposed in the EU, which targets the whole family of chemicals. Specifically, many of the responses from chemicals firms analysed by the Ends Report call for a commonly used type of Pfas called fluoropolymers – used across a broad range of industries including domestic cookware production, such as non-stick frying pans, and pharmaceuticals – to be spared the same kind of regulation as other types of forever chemicals, on the basis that they are not as harmful. The validity of this argument, being made on record to UK politicians for the first time, has been disputed by scientists, with one stating that the chemicals industry is “copying the Big Tobacco playbook”. The Reform MSP who defected from the Tories this week should stand down, first minister John Swinney has said, reports the PA news agency. Graham Simpson announced the move at a press conference alongside Reform UK leader Nigel Farage on Wednesday. Speaking on Thursday, Swinney called on Simpson to quit Holyrood, while also hitting out at the “obnoxiousness” of his new party leader’s stance on immigration, which he said was “undermining our legitimate economic aspirations”. The first minister pointed to a members’ bill proposed by Simpson which would create a recall mechanism for MSPs who have been jailed or suspended from Holyrood for more than 10 sitting days. Swinney said: Graham Simpson is the author of a bill about recalling members of parliament when they do things that people disapprove of. I think there’ll be Conservative voters in central Scotland who will be thinking ‘what is the guy I voted for doing now representing Farage?’ The hypocrisy of Graham Simpson is absolutely legendary on this – the author of the bill on recall now sits for a different political party, so that hypocrisy is just clearly visible. Asked if Simpson should stand down, the first minister said: “Yes, I think he should.” Simpson was elected to the central Scotland region in 2016 as a Conservative MSP and if he was to stand down, his former party would get to select his replacement. The first minister also hit out at Reform’s stance on immigration after a new poll this week suggested the issue had moved into the top three most important to Scots. Swinney said: I think it’s important that we have a reasoned debate about migration in our country. Scotland currently today faces a problem, which is that we have a declining working-age population. We need to have more people in Scotland working and contributing to our economy. I talk to sectors right across the country who are short of staff and need more staff to be recruited to deliver the services they want to deliver, so we need to attract more people to come to Scotland. Yet the immigration debate that has been fuelled by the obnoxiousness of Nigel Farage is undermining our legitimate economic aspirations to boost our population and to grow our economy. With Reform continuing to surge in the polls and Farage targeting the SNP, the first minister said he remains “very confident” Scots will be more interested in his party’s record in government over the past 18 years than Reform. Simpson’s defection came 24 hours before former Labour councillor in Glasgow Audrey Dempsey announced she was joining Reform (see 11.14am BST). Robin Green, appearing for Epping Forest district council at the court of appeal, said that the Home Office should not be involved in the case as it “came too late to the party”, reports the PA news agency. He also said the council took a decision to issue injunction proceedings against Somani Hotels on 5 August, several days before it filed documents at the high court on 12 August. Lord Justice Bean responded: Why not send a letter before action [to Somani Hotels] saying ‘unless you cease this use immediately, we are going to issue high court proceedings?’ Green replied that “a letter was not sent, and perhaps a letter should have been sent”, but said that Mr Justice Eyre “was aware of all this” when he made his decision to issue the temporary injunction. Responding to Tony Blair’s meeting at the White House with the Trump administration discussing the war in Gaza, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called on the former UK prime minister to give evidence in parliament about his discussions. In a statement on Thursday, Davey said: Tony Blair needs to come before parliament to give evidence about his discussions with the Trump administration about the ongoing war and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. If he has special insight into Trump’s intentions, it’s only right that parliament and the government are made privy to this. Trump has a unique power to help end this war, get the hostages out, and get the desperately needed aid in to relieve the horrendous human suffering in Gaza. We must leverage all the information and resources at our disposal to make him do the right thing. Immigration minister Seema Malhotra has dismissed Reform’s plans to tackle immigration numbers as “gimmicks” that have “unravelled on basic facts and figures”. The MP for Feltham and Heston said that she would not comment on Nigel Farage’s proposed deal with Afghanistan’s Taliban or “individual countries”. Speaking in Portsmouth, Malhotra told the PA news agency: I’m not commenting on individual countries in this way. What I will say is that we have a policy of returning people to their countries where they are safe or, as we’ve seen in the agreement with France, to safe third countries. What’s also the case is that we’ve seen Reform’s plan unravel after just two days, and if that’s their specialist subject to see their plans unravel on the basic facts and figures, one has to ask the question about what other plans they might have. Whether it’s for our NHS or any other areas of our public services, what we are committed to is taking the serious action that we need and not gimmicks. To make sure that we are stepping up the action we’re taking to disrupt the activity of these evil criminal gangs to make sure that we are returning those with no right to be here – over 35,000 since the last election. To make sure that we’re bringing in new powers for law enforcement and intelligence sharing with other countries through legislation we’re bringing forward in parliament that both the Tories and Reform have voted against, and to make sure that we are urgently speeding up the processing of asylum cases, a backlog that the last government left behind in a system that was utterly chaotic. She continued: Through these steps, I think what people will see is that we’re taking the action we need, and that we will see a closure to asylum hotels and to this evil criminal trade. When asked if the government had alternative plans to hotels for housing asylum-seekers, Maholtra said: What we are doing is making sure that we’re reducing the need for hotels. That’s the critical bit of this and we’ve got to do that by working with communities across the country, making sure that what we’re doing is processing asylum cases much more quickly, making sure that we’re returning those with no right to be here, and making sure that we are delivering on our commitment that we made in our manifesto to see a closure to all asylum hotels in this parliament. We’ve already seen a drop from the 400 asylum hotels that we saw open at their peak under the previous government, and seeing that now almost halved to just over 200, this is really important that we continue the work that we’re doing to make sure that we see a closure of all asylum hotels in line with our manifesto commitment in this parliament. That’s what we’re determined to do. When asked if the government was reliant on hotels, she said: Well, we’re also reliant on making sure that we’re clearing the backlog, because the number of people in hotels is as a result of the asylum cases that are open. What we need to do is to continue that step change that we’ve seen processing asylum cases much more quickly, making sure that we’re seeing those returns for people who have no right to be here as a result also of the returns agreements that we have been signing, whether that’s with Iraq, whether that’s with France. Whether that’s also in relation to the agreements and cooperation agreements we’ve got with other countries like Vietnam. When we see the results of all of those actions, when we see the new powers that are going to be coming in as a result of new legislation that we have brought in to parliament to increase intelligence sharing, to make it an offence to even supply criminal gangs, we are going to be doing much more than the previous government. We’re seeing the arrests step up of those involved in criminal gangs, and we’re seeing that this evil criminal trade is disrupted that we are seeing put lives at risk and undermine our border security. Becca Jones, director of asylum support in the Home Office, said it would be “significant” to lose 152 bedspaces from the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. The PA news agency reports that in a witness statement referenced in the court of appeal hearing on Thursday, Jones said there were 103,684 accommodated asylum-seekers as of 31 March, higher than in 2024. She said: In this context, and at this time, the loss of 152 bedspaces is significant when considering the Home Office’s legal duty. The availability of the hotel is also important in enabling the secretary of state to meet her duty to accommodate future asylum seekers going forward, in circumstances where the pressure on available properties is significant and increasing. Jones continued in her witness statement that the interim injunction would risk “encouraging other local authorities” to seek similar injunctions. She said: The Home Office is aware that there have been a series of protests in the local area about the use of the hotel, including some disorder in previous weeks. However, following appropriate police intervention, the situation is now understood to be one of managed, peaceful protest. Jones continued: The Home Office understands that local residents have concerns about the use of the hotel, which have been heard. However, those concerns must be viewed in the context of demands on the accommodation estate. She concluded: Granting the interim injunction sought risks setting a precedent which would have a serious impact on the secretary of state’s ability to house vulnerable people, both by encouraging other local authorities to seek such interim injunctions pending the outcome of substantive planning law complaints and those who seek to target asylum accommodation in acts of public disorder. Trade minister Douglas Alexander will promote the UK as an economic partner during a visit to Japan and South Korea, starting on Thursday. According to the PA news agency, in Japan, Alexander will give a speech at the Pacific Future forum, declaring that the UK is open for business and can be an indispensable partner in upholding global order. He will also join defence secretary John Healey onboard aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales to mark the deployment of the UK carrier strike group – which consists of Royal Navy warships, submarines and aircraft. In South Korea, Alexander will meet the Korean trade minister, Yeo Han-Koo, to work on the UK-South Korea free trade agreement, and will affirm the aim to conclude negotiations this year. A free trade agreement with South Korea could aid sectors such as financial services, legal services and health, while helping British companies such as Diageo expand in Korea. The minister will also meet the CEOs of LG AI Lab to discuss a recently signed partnership with the London Stock Exchange Group. Alexander said: Today’s world is one where barriers to trade are going up and geopolitical divides are deepening, resulting in higher costs for consumers and practical challenges for businesses. Our new trade and industrial strategies, based on a sense of pragmatic patriotism, provides the compass by which we will navigate today’s storms. From the deck of HMS Prince of Wales to the negotiating table in Seoul, the UK is forging durable economic partnerships which will help put more money in people’s pockets as part of the plan for change. Further to the previous post, the Foreign Office has confirmed that it summoned the Russian ambassador after strikes on Kyiv overnight killed civilians and damaged the British Council building in the Ukrainian capital. Foreign secretary David Lammy posted on X: Putin’s strikes last night killed civilians, destroyed homes and damaged buildings, including the British Council and EU delegation in Kyiv. We have summoned the Russian Ambassador. The killing and destruction must stop. According to reports, Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, is expected to be summoned by the British Foreign Office after Russian strikes on Kyiv killed at least 14 people and damaged the British Council’s office in the Ukrainian capital.

In case you missed it, Sky News shared a YouGov poll yesterday that showed that Labour has sunk to its lowest approval rating since July 2019. In the poll Labour is on just 20% of the intended voting intention, eight points behind Reform and just three points ahead of the Conservatives on 17% of the vote. Nigel Farage, Reform UK’s leader, has been making political capital over the small boats issue and has dominated headlines over the summer while the government has been relatively quiet and sometimes confused on its messaging. Earlier this month, the number of people who have arrived in the UK on small boats across the Channel since Keir Starmer won the general election last July hit 50,000, a milestone the prime minister and his team did not want to reach so soon. Children and young people are being overdiagnosed with mental health conditions in a society that has lost sight of the reality that child development is “messy and uneven”, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. He is the latest senior figure to add his voice to calls for a radical overhaul of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system in England. Hunt said in his half decade as health secretary, he witnessed “an alarming escalation” in the prevalence and severity of mental ill-health among young people, as well as significant increases in diagnoses of neurodevelopmental conditions. In a foreword to a new report by the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, Hunt said: Mental ill-health and neurodiversity now accounts for more than half of the post-pandemic increase we have seen in claimants of disability benefit. Spending on Send provision has sky-rocketed and risks the financial sustainability of local government. Rather than assuming that more money or more of the same is the answer, we need to ask more fundamental questions. Is a cash transfer – or a label that means young people are treated and come to see themselves as different – the right way to help them? He added: Across the political spectrum, and amongst a growing range of practitioners, it is now recognised that there is a level of ‘overdiagnosis’ [in] our system. We need to cut through the complexity to better understand the drivers of demand we are seeing. Hunt, who is Conservative MP for Godalming and Ash, and has also served as chancellor and foreign secretary under the Conservatives, said: As a society, we seem to have lost sight of the fundamental reality that child development is a messy and uneven process. Our laudable desire to ensure young people are happy and well-supported is at times manifesting in excessive impulses to medicalise and diagnose the routine in a manner that can undercut grit and resilience. The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year detailing how it plans to reform the Send system. Parents are concerned that education, health and care plans (EHCPs) – legally enforceable documents that detail a child or young person’s needs, and the support they require – will be targeted. Keir Starmer has begun a shake-up of No 10, including replacing an aide whose appointment had been a key battleground amid the departure of Sue Gray last autumn. Nin Pandit, the prime minister’s top civil service aide, is to leave her role after less than 10 months. Sources at No 10 denied she had quit and said she would step into a new policy delivery role and the prime minister would now take more direct control of delivery. The Guardian understands that Pandit, once praised by Dominic Cummings as one of “the brilliant women around the table” who would have done the job of prime minister “10 times better” than Boris Johnson, will be replaced by Dan York-Smith as Starmer’s principal private secretary. York-Smith’s appointment will be taken as a sign of No 10’s need to beef up economic expertise. It has long been rumoured that Starmer wanted to appoint more economic and infrastructure experts to his policy unit but no appointments have been announced. York-Smith is an experienced Treasury official, who has led economic strategy for six chancellors and oversees tax and welfare at the Treasury. Downing Street sources said there were more changes to come but said they believed the cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald, was safe in his role, despite briefings that several colleagues believe he has been ineffective. A No 10 source denied Pandit was being sacked or demoted and said she had the full confidence of the prime minister and would remain a key part of the operation. Her new role has not yet been named. Deputy first minister Kate Forbes has announced funding to help support the Scots language – which she said is a “treasured part” of Scotland’s history and culture, reports the PA news agency. Scottish government funding of £650,000 will help 11 organisations working to promote the language across the country. One of those receiving cash is Scots Hoose Yaldi, which will get almost £89,000 to help it provide free resources to schools and nurseries. During a visit to the Bill and Bain printworks in Glasgow, Forbes unveiled the project’s new children’s book, the Auchertermichty Aw-Stars, which is written in Scots and features plays about a youth football club. The book is one of a series of titles, including comics, which will be printed and distributed to young people as a result of government cash. Forbes said: These plays are part of a series of free Scots books, comics and poems which aim to provide young people with a better understanding of the language so that it can continue to grow. Scots is a treasured part of our history, heritage and culture. It enriches communities and research shows that learning the language benefits young people’s literacy skills and confidence. Other initiatives that will receive support include new Open University courses to help school teachers introduce Scots into their lessons, which will benefit from almost £85,000. The largest sum of cash – £231,000 – will go to the Dictionaries of the Scots Language project, which aims to detail the origins and meaning of every Scots word. The funding comes after the latest census statistics showed that in 2022, 2,444,659 people across the country had some skills in Scots – up from 515,215 in 2011. The number of youngsters aged 15 or under with some ability in Scots had increased from 48,310 to 260,356 over the same period. The funding is being awarded through the Scots language development fund in 2025-26, with Forbes saying the total amount represents a £150,000 increase when compared with last year. She also noted that ministers had brought forward the Scottish Languages Act to “establish Scots and Gaelic as official languages and introduce teaching standards for Scots”, with this legislation passed in June 2025. A former Labour councillor in Glasgow who quit the party after being accused of making racist remarks has joined Reform UK, making her the seventeenth Scottish councillor to defect to them. Reform UK announced on Thursday morning that Audrey Dempsey, who now sits as an independent on Glasgow city council, had become its latest elected member. Dempsey resigned as a Labour councillor in April last year after she was suspended for allegedly making racist remarks, and claiming that racist attacks on white children and teachers were rising in the city’s schools. She claimed at the time she had been raising concerns about the party’s directions for some time. “Instead the reaction of some has been to attack my character and reputation with cowardly leaks that have deliberately been twisted to fit a narrative,” she said in a statement on X. Dempsey, who runs a charity focusing on poverty among families in north Glasgow, is now the second Reform UK councillor in Glasgow and the second ex-Labour councillor to defect. She said Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, ran the party as a “self-serving clique”. Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, was different, she said. Reform UK and Nigel Farage aren’t just challenging the status quo; they’re ripping it apart. They’re focused on tackling illegal migration, standing up for women and girls’ safety and transforming working people lives for the better. That’s what I’ve always done in my professional life and specifically designed my charity to put Glasgow’s people first. Unlike Reform’s electoral successes in England and Wales, none of its 17 Scottish councillors has yet won an election for Reform UK; most have defected from the Conservatives or as independents. Those 17 representatives make up 1.4% of the 1,226 councillors sitting in Scotland. On Tuesday, Nigel Farage, the party’s UK leader, unveiled a Scottish Conservative MSP, Graham Simpson, as its latest recruit. Simpson is the party’s sole MSP at Holyrood, but recent polling suggests Reform UK could win a number of seats at the next Holyrood election in May 2026 after leap-frogging the Tories and edging close to Labour’s level of support. Government funding for a programme which offers children from low-income families free meals and activities during the school holidays will be extended, reports the PA news agency. The Department for Education (DfE) has said working families on free school meals could save more than £800 a year thanks to its investment into holiday clubs. According to the PA news agency, £600m is being invested to extend the holiday activity and food (HAF) programme – which funds councils to provide holiday childcare, activities and food for children eligible for free school meals – for another three years. It comes as working parents in England will be able to access 30 hours a week of funded childcare for children older than nine months from Monday. With just days to go until the full rollout, education secretary Bridget Phillipson has called on eligible parents in England to “take up” the offer. The expansion of funded childcare – which was introduced by the Conservative government – began being rolled out in England in April last year for working parents of two-year-olds. Working parents of children older than nine months are now also able to access 15 hours of funded childcare a week during term time, before the full rollout of 30 hours a week to all eligible families from next week. The HAF programme – for school-age children from reception to year 11 – helps parents to make savings of more than £300 a year, the DfE said. In July, the Coram Family and Childcare charity called for the HAF programme to be maintained after March 2026 to ensure disadvantaged children have childcare during school holidays. Andrew Forsey, national director of Feeding Britain, said: Today’s news will be welcomed by hundreds of thousands of parents across England. The support provided to children from lower incomes through the holiday activities fund eases the pressure on family budgets during the school holidays, enhances their access to enriching and physical activities, and gives them a healthy meal each day during the school holidays. This delivers a raft of benefits for children and their families, so it is excellent news that the government is extending this provision for a further three years. Phillipson said: Giving every child the best start in life is my number one priority, which is why we are delivering on our commitment to provide hundreds of thousands of children with 30 hours government-funded early education. Whether it’s to save up to £7,500 a year, support parents to get back to work or reduce the pressure on grandparents who so often have to step in, the benefits are widespread. The offer is just around the corner, and so I’m urging every eligible parent who wants it, to take it up. A Reform council leader’s decision to ban his councillors from engaging with a prominent local newspaper is a “massive attack on local democracy” and a sign of things to come should the party form the next government, the outlet’s editor has warned. In an unprecedented move, Nottinghamshire county council’s four-month-old Reform administration has said it will no longer deal with the Nottingham Post, its online edition and a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that it manages. Nigel Farage is already facing calls to intervene in the row, with local MPs accusing Reform of “rank hypocrisy” over its previous claims to support free speech and transparency. Lee Anderson, the Reform MP for Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, has said he will join in the boycott. In an interview with the Guardian, Natalie Fahy, the editor of the Nottingham Post and Nottinghamshire Live, said the ban had come from Mick Barton, the county council’s leader, after a story about plans for a restructuring of local government. She said it was a worrying sign of Reform’s approach to the free press. “It’s a massive attack on local democracy,” she said. I’ve been a journalist for 20 years. We have had our ups and downs with all kinds of councils. We managed to get along fine, because most elected officials accept this is par for the course. You are going to get some negative press. What you don’t do is shut the shop up. This is a worrying sign of potentially things to come if Reform wins the next election. What you’re seeing here in Nottinghamshire is probably a microcosm of how it will be across the whole of the UK if Nigel Farage becomes prime minister. You are just going to see this kind of shutting down of questioning. They need to be answerable to the people who elected them. We don’t take a political stance. We’re not anti-Reform. We’re just trying to find out what’s going on. The move has already caused concern among other parties. The Lib Dems have written to Farage to demand that he step in to reverse the “dangerous and chilling” decision. They also suggested that the move may have breached local government’s code of conduct, which calls on elected officials to “submit themselves to the scrutiny”. The UK, France and Germany are expected to announce on Thursday that they will reimpose sweeping sanctions on Iran for failing to readmit UN inspectors into all of its nuclear sites. The decision, under consideration for months, is likely to provoke the worst crisis in Iran’s relations with the west since Israel’s attacks on the country’s nuclear sites in June. Iran is already preparing countermeasures. The planned reimposition of the sanctions, contained in six suspended UN resolutions, will start on 18 October when the original nuclear deal signed in 2015 expires. The move by the three European powers – known as the E3 – cannot be vetoed by permanent members of the UN security council such as Russia and China. The E3 is demanding Iran fully readmit inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Europe also wants details on what happened to the estimated 400kg stockpile of Iran’s highly enriched uranium after Israel’s attacks in June. Confirmation of the partial return of IAEA inspectors on Wednesday was met with protests by officials in Tehran, who claim the strict preconditions they set have been breached. The European countries still hope the expected formal notification to the UN that they are triggering the snapback of the sanctions will provoke Iranian concessions and further diplomacy. Heat pumps could save households hundreds of pounds a year on heating bills, if the government took simple measures to reform the energy system, an analysis has found. The average household’s heating bills could be roughly halved, saving about £375 a year with a heat pump instead of a gas boiler, if steps were taken to make electricity cheaper. These steps include ending green levies on electrical heating, reforming how electricity is priced, and taking measures to prevent gas power companies from jacking up their profits, according to an analysis by the thinktank E3G. Heat pumps, which run on electricity, are more efficient than gas boilers and will be essential to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions. However, they are more expensive to run in the UK than they need to be, because of the way the UK’s privatised energy system is managed. At present, homeowners with heat pumps who are on the right tariff and have well-insulated homes should save money. But some homeowners who replace gas boilers with electric heat pumps may get no saving, or even a cost increase. Their average annual heating bill is likely to be about £920, according to E3G, compared with £820 for homes with a gas boiler. This discrepancy has held back installations, and led anti-net zero campaigners to decry heat pumps and claim that policies to promote them should be discarded. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has publicly voiced disquiet on the issue, while the government chief scientist has admitted that the lack of cost saving currently seen by some households was a problem. But with a few measures, the government could transform the prospects for heat pumps and save money for millions of households, the E3G analysis has shown. The Home Office’s attempt to challenge the decision to temporarily block the owner of the Bell hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers is to be heard at the court of appeal on Thursday. Last week, Mr Justice Eyre granted an interim injunction to Epping Forest district council, stopping the hotel’s owner, Somani Hotels, from using the Essex hotel to accommodate asylum seekers beyond 12 September. The authority asked for an injunction to be granted after the hotel became the focal point of several protests and counter-protests in recent weeks. The Home Office and Somani Hotels will both seek to challenge the ruling at a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, with the department also in an attempt to appeal against Eyre’s decision not to let it intervene in the case. The hearing before Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb is due to start at 10am. Former prime minister Liz Truss has appeared on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to give her views on the current economic situation in the UK. Asked whether she would join Reform, she said she was “not really thinking about party politics at the moment because my whole experience of being in government was that the power was not in the hands of the politicians”. Truss added that a Farage government cannot work without an institutional shake up: Even if Nigel Farage gets elected in 2029, if the bureaucracy is not changed, if there is not fundamental change of how the UK is wrong, nothing will change. On the NHS, she said: The cult is wearing thin. There is, has, been a cult. People are recognising its failures. I don’t think the American system is anything to aspire to but if you look at countries like Germany, France [and] Japan, they manage to achieve better outcomes with similar levels of spending. I think everyone in Britain recognises that it’s not working as it is currently constituted. On the health system being free at the point of use, Truss added: It costs you in other ways. Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a remit to challenge government thinking. Greg Jackson has joined the Cabinet Office board, an influential core of government advisers, as a non-executive member. The announcement comes weeks after ministers ruled out his plan to split the national energy market into regional zones, which would have meant users in different areas would pay different rates for their electricity. The tech entrepreneur, who has long had links to the Labour party, responded to that decision by saying he would “respectfully disagree”. Jackson failed to win over ministers after a long and controversial campaign, in part because zonal pricing would have meant higher energy prices in the south-east of England and lower prices in Scotland. He claimed that electricity prices that reflected local supply and demand dynamics would encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that have more renewable energy generation such as Scotland and encourage renewables developers to base their projects closer to where their energy was needed. Jackson is now expected to play an influential role in shaping how future government policies are implemented. His non-executive role is one of a number that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from outside government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on policy decisions. Jackson is expected to use his three-year term on the Cabinet Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder, who set up Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the energy supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company in less than a decade. Speculation that the chancellor could announce new property taxes in her autumn budget is likely to slow down an already price-sensitive housing market, estate agents have said. Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering a tax on the sale of homes over £500,000 and the removal of the capital gains tax exemption on primary residences above £1.5m as ways to boost income for the government. The property website Zoopla said changes to the taxation of homes over £500,000 “may make some buyers consider a wait-and-see strategy. This covers those who may possibly save money on purchases under £500,000 and concern those buying over this level as well”. It said a third of homes for sale were priced at more than £500,000, with London and the south-east of England in line to be most affected by a change. The website’s latest monthly snapshot of the property market showed the number of sales agreed was up by 5% year on year in July and that average prices had risen by 1.3%. One in 10 homes listed had been reduced in price, above the five-year average of 6% of homes. Homes that have been reduced are typically on the market for almost two and a half times longer than those that are priced well when they go on the market, Zoopla said. Richard Donnell, an executive director at Zoopla, said: Sellers need to understand local market conditions when considering how to market their home, setting the right price and how quickly they would like to sell. The risk of being too ambitious on price is your home taking more than twice as long to find a buyer, or not selling at all. Ed Davey said “no disrespect is meant to the king” in his decision to boycott Donald’s Trump’s state banquet next month in a protest against the US president’s position on Gaza (see 8.59am BST). The Liberal Democrat leader told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I think anyone who knows my approach to the monarchy, and to the king in particular, knows how much I respect him. I’ve written to him personally and the fact, as I say, that I’ve had to wrestle with it shows that no disrespect is meant to the king at all. Announcing the boycott, the politician said he and his wife, Emily, had “prayed about it”. He told the Today programme: I am a Christian. My wife and I go to our local church, St Andrew’s and St Mark’s, very regularly. My faith is very important to me and to my wife and although you’re right, other people say religion doesn’t impact your politics, it does impact mine. I don’t talk about it very much but in this moment I had to be very honest, I’ve thought and prayed about this, I really have. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will boycott King Charles’s state banquet held in honour of Donald Trump to protest against the US president’s failure to intervene decisively to end the war in Gaza. Davey, who is invited to the dinner for Trump’s state visit to the UK, said to turn down an invitation from the king went against all his instincts and that it was a deeply serious move to refuse to attend. But he said he feared unless he took a stand over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the lack of pressure on Israel from the US government, no one would raise the issue during the president’s visit in late September. Davey said: Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both Donald Trump and Keir Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away. Trump’s state visit is an honour that has never previously been extended for a second time to a US president. Davey said he believed Keir Starmer was right to engage with Trump, but said it was vital that someone raised the issue of Gaza in a way that could not be ignored. In a Guardian piece explaining his decision, Davey wrote: The humanitarian crisis in Gaza must stop. The famine must end. The hostages must be returned home. There is one man, more than anyone else, who has the power to make it happen. Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace, with a two-state solution. But so far, he’s decided not to. Instead, he’s given Netanyahu his full support. A Government minister refused to be drawn on reports the Treasury is considering a tax increase on landlords for Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget. Stephen Morgan, education minister, told Times Radio and Sky News he was unable to comment on speculation which was reported in the Times on Wednesday that national insurance will be imposed on rental income. According to the PA news agency, Morgan instead said he wanted the budget to be rooted in “Labour values”. He told Times Radio: Obviously taxation policies are a matter for the chancellor of the exchequer, and she will set out more detail in the budget later this year. I want to make sure that our budget is based on our Labour values, and that is what Rachel Reeves will deliver. It’s not for me to comment on speculation. Our focus is on driving growth in the economy and delivering for working people up and down the country. Speaking later to Sky News, Morgan said: We’re focused on growing the economy. Fixing the foundations of the country, restoring public service and that decade of national renewal. I’m afraid you will have to wait until the budget later this year. It was reported on Tuesday that the cost of UK government borrowing had jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Reeves to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. In other developments, the court of appeal will hear applications for permission to appeal against the Epping Bell hotel ruling from the hotelier and the Home Office from 10am. Here is a short summary of other key events: Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a remit to challenge government thinking. Greg Jackson has joined the Cabinet Office board, an influential core of government advisers, as a non-executive member. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will boycott King Charles’s state banquet held in honour of Donald Trump to protest against the US president’s failure to intervene decisively to end the war in Gaza. Davey, who is invited to the dinner for Trump’s state visit to the UK, said to turn down an invitation from the king went against all his instincts and that it was a deeply serious move to refuse to attend. Children and young people are being overdiagnosed with mental health conditions in a society that has lost sight of the reality that child development is “messy and uneven”, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. He is the latest senior figure to add his voice to calls for a radical overhaul of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system in England. A Reform council leader’s decision to ban his councillors from engaging with a prominent local newspaper is a “massive attack on local democracy” and a sign of things to come should the party form the next government, the outlet’s editor has warned. In an unprecedented move, Nottinghamshire county council’s four-month-old Reform administration has said it will no longer deal with the Nottingham Post, its online edition and a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that it manages.

54) UK and EU summon top Russian diplomats after strikes hit British Council and EU offices in deadly attack on Kyiv - as it happened — The Guardian (2025-08-28)

     … and on that note, it’s a wrap! The UK and European Union have summoned their Russian envoys after overnight missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and damaged the city’s British Council and EU offices (9:43, 10:19, 10:29, 10:27, 11:38, 11:52, 11:56, 13:23, 15:23). European leaders condemned the attacks, calling them “a blow” to peace efforts (11:04), and acts of “senseless” and “horrific” violence (11:18, 13:52), instisting they cannot “remain without consequences” (11:54, 15:16). Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko urged partners to ramp up pressure on Russia as they called for further sanctions against Moscow (11:24, 16:12). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa. The latest death toll update from the Ukrainian authorities said that at least 18 people died, and 48 were injured after last night’s strike, Associated Press reported. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni was the latest European leader to respond to the attacks, saying that they “demonstrate who stands on the side of peace and who has no intention of believing in the negotiating path.” “Our thoughts go to the Ukrainian people, to civilians, to the families of defenceless victims, including children, of the senseless Russian attacks,” she said. In a first US reaction to overnight strikes, Donald Trump’s special peace envoy Keith Kellogg called them “egregious” and warned that they “threaten the peace that [Trump] is pursuing.” He pointedly said that the target of the attacks were “not soldiers and weapons, but residential areas in Kyiv – blasting civilian trains, the EU &amp; British mission council offices, and innocent civilians.” So far, there has been no public reaction from Trump himself. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has now offered his readout from his call with the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen (15:13), thanking for “the condolences and solidarity with our people” after last night’s massive strikes on Kyiv. In a post on X, Zelenskyy said: “Last night was one of the largest attacks on Ukraine. The Russians chose Kyiv as their main target. The search and rescue operation is still ongoing. We are grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine now and does not remain silent.” He added that during his call with von der Leyen, the pair “discussed our diplomatic efforts to stop the killings, to end this unprovoked Russian aggression, and to guarantee real security for our people.” “There is much work being done at various levels precisely for this purpose. But until Russia takes real steps toward peace, the pressure on it must be intensified. Ursula shared updates on the preparation of the 19th EU sanctions package and coordination with other partners,” he said. He also added that they touched upon the on-going accession process, as Ukraine continues to work towards joining the EU. in Berlin With growing discussions about Europe’s defence capabilities, weapons manufacturing giant Rheinmetall has opened a new ammunition factory in the north of Germany yesterday, which will be the largest in Europe when it reaches full capacity. Inaugurating the plant in the presence of Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, as well as Germany’s defence minister Boris Pistorius and vice-chancellor Lars Klingbeil, Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger said similar sites could be built at speed to create a “pan-European defence ecosystem”. Papperger said countries like Lithuania and Britain were already developing such factories and that it was in Europe’s interest for Romania, Latvia and Ukraine to be “put in the position to produce urgently needed protective and defence equipment” at home. Work on the Unterlüß plant began in February 2024 with a €500m investment. It is expected to employ 500 people and this year produce about 25,000 rounds of ammunition, rising to 350,000 artillery shells annually by 2027. Construction on a production facility for rocket artillery is also to begin on the site. Papperger’s name made international headlines last year when it emerged that US intelligence services had foiled a Russian plot to assassinate him in an apparent attempt at retaliation over Rheinmetall’s role in providing a large amount of armaments for Ukraine. The plan to murder Papperger, as the head of Germany’s leading arms manufacturer was one of several Russian government schemes to kill defence industry executives in European countries that have been supporting Ukraine’s war effort, according to media reports. Germany controversially scrapped borrowing limits earlier this year to allow a “bazooka” of defence spending after decades of neglect of its military. The move was orchestrated by the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, even before he took office in May, while the Unterlüß factory was initiated under his predecessor Olaf Scholz, who introduced a Zeitenwende or turning point in security policy in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The German government placed a €8.5bn munitions order last year which the Rheinmetall site will now help fill. All Nato members are expected to his the historical 2% defence spending target this year, the alliance said, publishing a new set of reported figures from its member states. But as many as 19 countries are expected to meet the target by the tiniest of margins, with their expected expenditure within the range of 2.0 to 2.1% GDP, the data showed. The data also show that only three top spenders are already in compliance with the Nato’s new, more ambitious 3.5% target adopted at this year’s summit in The Hague, the Netherlands. It will be further complimented by a secondary 1.5% GDP target for wider defence-related spending. The alliance’s biggest spenders are all on the Eastern flank and neighbouring Russia, with Poland leading the pack (4.48%) ahead of Lithuania (4.0%), Latvia (3.73%), and Estonia (3.38%). The US is sixth at 3.22%. A number of Nato countries have pro-actively revised their defence spending in recent years, responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the highest spenders looking to meet the 5% target already in the coming years, while others arguing they will need more time. And we are getting more unique footage of the overnight strikes on Kyiv, recorded by a local resident and showing the immediate aftermath of the attack. German chancellor Friedrich Merz also condemned the attacks on Kyiv, saying “Russia showed its true face again last night.” In a post on X, he said: “Russia showed its true face again last night. We condemn the severe attacks against the civilian population in the strongest terms. The fact that the EU representation has now also come under fire testifies to the growing ruthlessness of the Russian regime.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen spoke with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US president Donald Trump today, discussing the last night’s attack on Kyiv. She said that “Putin must come to the negotiating table,” as she reiterated the need for “a just and lasting peace for Ukraine” supported by “firm and credible security guarantees.” Here is her statement in full: “Just spoke with President @ZelenskyyUa, then @POTUS Donald Trump, following the massive strike on Kyiv which also hit our EU offices. Putin must come to the negotiating table. We must secure a just and lasting peace for Ukraine with firm and credible security guarantees that will turn the country into a steel porcupine. Europe will fully play its part. Our defence instrument SAFE, for example, will be important to strengthening the brave Ukrainian armed forces.” Svitlana Vodolaha, a spokeswoman for the state rescue service told the Guardian, 17 people had been killed at the residential block, including four children, and 11 were known to have been injured. A further 10 were still unaccounted for but not all may have been in the building at the time, she added. There were 200 rescuers and 59 rescue vehicles on site and the search and clean up effort expected to go on into the night. Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan told Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call on Thursday that Ankara was ready to help any high-level talks between Ukraine and Russia take place, his office said in a statement. Erdogan also told Zelenskiy that Turkey would continue to contribute to Ukraine’s security after peace was achieved, the Turkish presidency said. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has been in contact with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen about Russia’s attack on a building housing the EU’s delegation in Ukraine, he said on Thursday. Rutte, speaking at a meeting of German government parties in the southern city of Wuerzburg, added that he could not speak to the latest rumours about Russian espionage in Europe. Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov inspected the ‘Center’ group of Russian forces operating in Ukraine, his ministry said on Thursday. Belousov was briefed on combat operations and drone projects, the ministry said. UK foreign secretary David Lammy has now confirmed that the British government has summoned the Russian ambassador to the UK Foreign Office. In a brief post on X, he said: “Putin’s strikes last night killed civilians, destroyed homes and damaged buildings, including the British Council and EU Delegation in Kyiv. We have summoned the Russian Ambassador. The killing and destruction must stop.” Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavský also responded to the overnight Russian attack on Kyiv, saying it was “a horrific display of Russia’s contempt for peace negotiations.” “Russian missiles struck several buildings, including the EU delegation. Shame on the aggressor. Our deepest condolences to the families of the victims. Czechia will continue to stand firmly with Ukraine,” he said. Sky News is reporting that the Russian ambassador to the UK will be summoned by the Foreign Office over the last night’s large-scale attack that “severely damaged” the British Council’s office in Kyiv. We will bring you more on this if/when we get an official confirmation. In a separate statement on X, British Council Ukraine said that one of its guards was injured in the overnight strike that severely damaged its building and remains in hospital. Meanwhile, the Kremlin claimed it was still interested in pursuing peace talks with Ukraine – despite its massive overnight attack on Kyiv. Russian forces were continuing to target Ukrainian military and military-related infrastructure, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, as reported by Reuters and AFP. He has repeatedly claimed, without offering any evidence, that Russia does not deliberately target civilians. “The Russian armed forces are also carrying out their tasks. As stated, they continue to strike military and military-related infrastructure. The strikes are successful, the targets are being destroyed, and the special military operation continues. At the same time, Russia remains interested in continuing the negotiation process in order to achieve our goals through political and diplomatic means.” EU’s justice spokesperson Markus Lammert offered a bit more light on the EU’s discussions on what to do with frozen Russian assets in the EU. He explained: “The EU always been clear that Russia has to pay for the damages of this war, and legally sound and financially viable options must remain on the table to compensate the damages done by Russia to Ukraine. We need to continue discussing this. But what we’re talking about now is the profits from these assets. We have immobilised Russia’s assets, of which there are €210bn in the EU and we are using the profits from these assets to support Ukraine with a €45bn G7 loan. This money goes, for example, to Ukraine’s defence industry and energy recovery, the loans will then be repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues from immobilised Russian assets.” Pressed on whether it could include a confiscation of the Russian assets is on the table, the spokespeople said that a broader discussion on the issue of frozen assets will be held on Saturday. EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has just announced in the last few minutes that she spoke with EU diplomats based in Kyiv after last night’s Russian strike that hit the EU delegation. She added that the EU will be “summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels” to protest against the attack. Foreign policy spokesperson Anitta Hipper added a bit more on that: “I confirm that we will be summoning the Russian chargé d’affaires. This meeting will still take place today, so I can debrief you after that. But fact is also that no diplomatic mission should be ever [a] target to two strikes. So this is our response to this question.” EU’s chief deputy spokesperson Arianna Podestà offered a bit more detail on the EU’s understanding of the attack on its delegation in Kyiv, Ukraine. Asked if the EU believes the attack was deliberate, she said: “This is a question for Russia on what was the aim of the strike. What is clear is that Russia strikes constantly on civilian facilities as well. People have died in this horrible attack. Of course, we have been in touch, the president has been in touch, with the ambassador for what concerns the safety of the EU staff. But these attacks of Russia on civilians, and is just one of the many we have seen, also in other areas of Ukraine, just in this last few hours, are completely unacceptable. In no way will they change the resolve of the European Union in supporting Ukraine. Our support to Ukraine is unshakable, as always, and Russia’s threats, also by hitting our facilities, will change nothing in our commitment to supporting Ukraine to be in a position of strength now and in the future.” The European Commission’s midday briefing – held twice a week during summer – is about to start, so I will look out for any further lines with reaction to the overnight strikes that hit the EU delegation in Kyiv and the British Council’s Kyiv office, among others. German foreign minister Johann Wadephul told reporters that Russian attacks on Kyiv overnight cannot be allowed to “remain without consequences,” Reuters reported. Speaking at a press conference with his Estonian counterpart, he declined to elaborate on what could be done in response, saying that Germany wanted to show it is considering a further response and that any action would be taken jointly by the EU. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has now given a further statement on the overnight attacks on Kyiv. She said she was “outraged” by the attack, which affected the EU delegation to Ukraine, giving a bit more detail on “two missiles in a distance of 50 meters of the delegation within 20 seconds.” She warned: It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorise Ukraine. She also said the EU will soon propose a new package of sanctions against Russia, and the bloc was “advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets to contribute to Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction.” Standing in front of EU flags, she said: “I’m outraged by the attack on Kyiv also hitting our EU offices. This was the deadliest drone and missile attack on the capital since July, and as you can see behind me on the screen, it was an attack also on our delegation. I just spoke with our deputy ambassador, and I’m relieved that none of our staff were harmed. Last night’s attack struck in close proximity of the diplomatic mission, the representation of our union, two missiles hit in a distance of 50 metres of the delegation within 20 seconds. And this is another grim reminder of what is at stake. It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorise Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union. This is why we are keeping maximum pressure on Russia. That means tightening our sanctions regime. We will come forward soon with our 19th package of hard, biting sanctions. And in parallel, we are advancing the work on the Russian frozen assets to contribute to Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction. And of course, we are ensuring strong, unwavering support to Ukraine, our neighbour, partner, friend and our future member.” The British Council’s Kyiv office has put out a short statement confirming its offices have been “severely damaged” in the Russian attack overnight and will be closed “until further notice.” It said: “Following last night’s attack on Kyiv, our British Council office has been severely damaged and will be closed to visitors until further notice. While there may be some delays in our responses, our work with our Ukrainian partners in education and culture continues. You can reach us via email.” French president Emmanuel Macron is the latest European leader to condemn the overnight Russian attacks on Kyiv. He said that 629 Russian missiles and drones deployed against Ukraine in one night demonstrated “Russia’s idea of peace,” calling it out as “terror and barbarism.” Noting the attack struck civilian areas, and EU and British Council offices, he said that “France condemns these senseless and cruel attacks in the strongest possible terms.” “Full support to the Ukrainian people, and deepest compassion for all the grieving families,” he added. Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko has now responded to the overnight Russian attacks on Kyiv, criticising Moscow for “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians.” “The Russians are not choosing to end the war, only constant expansion of atrocities,” she said. She added: “Overnight in Kyiv, dozens of buildings were hit: residential houses, office centers, civilian enterprises. Among them also the building where the European Union Delegation to Ukraine is located. Russians now believe that they have paralyzed Ukraine’s allies with feigned plans for ‘negotiations’ and endless delays that only serve as methods to buy time with the true goal only of preventing sanctions. It is crucial now that the world responds firmly. Russia must be stopped. New and stronger sanctions are needed. The Russians understand only strength and pressure. For every strike, Moscow must feel the consequences.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer also expressed his solidarity with all affected by “senseless” Russian strikes on Kyiv overnight. He also confirms that the strikes have damaged the British Council building, as reported earlier (10:19). He says: “My thoughts are with all those affected by the senseless Russian strikes on Kyiv which have damaged the British Council building. Putin is killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace. This bloodshed must end.” A number of European leaders have condemned the overnight Russian attacks on Kyiv. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that “while the world seeks a path to peace, Russia responds with missiles,” calling out what she saw as a Russian “deliberate choice to escalate and mock the peace efforts.” Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said that every further aggression by Russia was “a new blow against peace,” as he insisted that the strike which hit the EU delegation in Kyiv was also “a new flagrant violation of international law.” Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda said he was “appalled by Russia’s massive strike on Kyiv last night,” which he said was “an attack on European diplomatic representations, damaging the buildings of @EUDelegationUA and the British Council.” “Russia’s terror will not break us. We stand firmly with Ukraine and its people,” he said. The Croatian government also condemned “yet another ruthless attack” on Kyiv. “In this latest attack, the building of the European Union Delegation was also damaged. While Ukraine and its partners are focused on possibilities for progress in the peace process, Russia continues its aggression against a sovereign country and its people with almost nightly attacks across Ukraine.” The EU’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, also responded to the attack, saying that the EU delegation’s building was “severely damaged by the shock wave.” This is Moscow’s true answer to peace efforts. European Council president António Costa also condemned the attack, saying he was “horrified” by the overnight strikes on Ukraine. He also expressed his solidarity with the victims and the staff of the EU’s delegation to Ukraine, claiming the Russian attack on the bloc’s diplomatic representation was “deliberate.” “The EU will not be intimidated. Russia’s aggression only strengthens our resolve to stand with Ukraine and its people,” he said. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has confirmed that the staff of the EU delegation in Kyiv was safe after the overnight Russian attack on Kyiv that hit its building. In a post on X, she said: “Another night of Russia’s relentless bombings struck civilian infrastructure and killed innocents. It also hit our EU Delegation in Kyiv. Our Delegation staff is safe. Russia must stop its indiscriminatory attacks on civilian infrastructure immediately and join negotiations for a just and lasting peace.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy just said the death toll of the overnight attack on Kyiv rose to 14, including three children. He called it a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians.” The Russians are not choosing to end the war, only new strikes. He added: “Overnight in Kyiv, dozens of buildings were damaged: residential houses, office centers, civilian enterprises. Among them also the building where the European Union Delegation to Ukraine is located.” He urged the world to “respond firmly,” as he stressed that “Russia must stop this war it started and continues.” “For the spurning of ceasefire and for the constant Russian attempts to weasel out of negotiations, new strong sanctions are needed. Only this can work. The Russians understand only strength and pressure. For every strike, Moscow must feel the consequences.” in Kyiv Looking at first reports from the area that was hit by overnight Russian strikes, it appears that the British Council’s offices in the centre of Kyiv have been hit, in an attack that took place at 5.40am. Their Kyiv building is located very close to the EU delegation, and a number of pictures we are getting on the news agencies this morning appear to show it damaged by the strikes. We have reached out to the British Council to find out if there were any casualties and to get a statement. It is understood the organisation, which promotes the UK and English teaching abroad, is establishing what happened. Russian airstrikes have killed at least twelve people in a succession of attacks on Kyiv overnight and wounded dozens more in the most deadly night raid on the Ukrainian capital for several weeks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who revealed that a child was among the dead, said the attacks showed that Russia had no intention of negotiating an end the war, despite the recent intervention of US president Donald Trump. The EU’s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, said the EU delegation in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes. “I strongly condemn these brutal attacks, a clear sign that Russia rejects peace &amp; chooses terror. Our full solidarity goes to EU staff, their families, &amp; all Ukrainians enduring this aggression,” she said. The attack comes amid growing doubts over whether Russia is genuinely interested in continuing the Trump-led peace process, which was discussed with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, as European leaders call it out as delay tactics that lead to nowhere. We should hear more about it later today, with the European Commission set to brief journalists at its usual midday briefing. Separately, EU defence and foreign ministers are meeting in Copenhagen tonight ahead an informal meeting focused on discussing the bloc’s next steps on Ukraine, with security guarantees high on the agenda. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Thursday, 28 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.

55) Are European powers pushing Iran into a corner with UN sanctions threat? — Al Jazeera (2025-08-28)

     France, the United Kingdom and Germany are demanding Iran make tough concessions to avoid coming under more sanctions.
     By Mat Nashed
     Three European powers have triggered a process that would reimpose punishing United Nations sanctions on Iran for ostensibly not engaging with the international community to reach a deal on its nuclear programme.
     Known as the E3, France, Germany and the United Kingdom told Iran on Thursday that the ‘snapback’ mechanism had been triggered, and that Iran now had 30 days to negotiate a nuclear agreement.
     European officials have sought to emphasise that triggering the snapback mechanism does not mean an end to the road for negotiations, but an Iranian official told the Reuters news agency that the move was “an action against diplomacy, not a chance for it”.
     As the deadline looms, observers and analysts fear that reimposing UN sanctions will significantly escalate regional tensions and embolden Israel and the United States to attack Iran again.
     While the stakes are high, the demands by the E3 –  three of the six remaining signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal – aren’t so easy to meet, experts told Al Jazeera.
     They want Iran to resume negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme and allow international inspectors back in to monitor sites and stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
     The US quit the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed its own sanctions on Iran.
     In April and May this year, it entered nuclear talks with Iran, demanding that Iran give up its centrifuges – needed to highly enrich uranium – and “downblend” its current nuclear programme.
     Downblending is a process where highly enriched uranium is diluted with low-enriched uranium.
     But in June, the US changed its position and demanded that Iran give up its entire nuclear programme, a suggestion Iran rejected outright.
     The US suspended talks, and Israel attacked Iran in June, in an apparent attempt to dismember the ruling government.  The “12-day war” saw the US join in to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.
     Since then, the US has maintained that Iran must give up its nuclear programme as a precondition for new talks.
     Iran has long stated that it has no interest in pursuing a nuclear bomb and that its programme is for civilian purposes.
     Moreover, as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is entitled to enrich uranium for civilian sectors such as energy, cancer research, and other scientific research.
     Trita Parsi, Iran expert and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told Al Jazeera the E3’s demands risk accelerating another round of regional conflict.
     “If you restart talks at a moment when you know that talks will fail, then you ensure that military attacks will happen sooner rather than later,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.
     The JCPOA was signed between Iran and the members of the UN Security Council (UNSC), plus Germany and the European Union.
     The deal stipulated that Iran must not enrich uranium above 3.67 percent, far below weaponisation.
     In return, the parties agreed to lift debilitating UN sanctions, yet any one of the signatories could reimpose sanctions unilaterally if they found Iran was not complying with the JCPOA.
     When US President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the JCPOA in 2018, Iran accused the US of violating the deal and the Europeans of “indirectly” violating it by not providing options for Iran to avoid US sanctions.
     Iran also notified the Europeans and the US that it would increase enrichment levels beyond JCPOA limits.
     Some experts believe Iran was increasing enrichment to gain leverage with Western states for a future deal, as Al Jazeera previously reported.
     And after the 12-day war, Iran denied access to the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is tasked with monitoring Iran’s nuclear sites under the NPT and the JCPOA.
     Before triggering the snapback mechanism, the E3 had required Iran to resume talks with the US, and grant access to IAEA inspectors.
     Some within Iran’s leadership believe the IAEA leaked sensitive information to the US.
     “One position coming out of Tehran is that their cooperation with the IAEA over the years prepared the ground for the [US] attacks…because the US and Israel had very clear mapping and info of the programme,” Negar Mortazavi, an expert on Iran with the Center for International Policy (CIP), said.
     “There is now a big view in Iran’s domestic political space that maybe we should stop cooperating with the IAEA,” she added.
     Iran is reportedly hiding some 400kg (880lb) of 60 percent enriched uranium, a level just below weapons-grade.
     Iran views the 60 percent stockpile as its last bargaining chip vis-a-vis Washington, according to Hamidreza Azizi, an expert on Iran and visiting fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWB).
     He added that Iran is, therefore, reluctant to disclose the whereabouts of that uranium out of fear of giving up its last source of leverage in future negotiations.
     “[The E3] wants complete transparency that removes the ambiguity around Iran’s most sensitive nuclear activities,” Azizi told Al Jazeera.
     Iran has reached out to the US to resume talks since June, according to CIP’s Mortazavi.
     She added that, on the one hand, Iran refuses to project weakness after the war for fear of signalling that it will make concessions if attacked by the US and Israel, while, on the other hand, the US refuses to engage until Iran agrees to “zero enrichment”.
     The US is also struggling to save face after Trump declared that Iran’s nuclear programme had been completely destroyed in June, an assessment quickly contradicted by US intelligence.
     Yet any resumption of talks would be a clear admission that Iran’s nuclear programme is still very much functional, said Parsi.
     Azizi, from SWB, believes that the E3 and Iran should consider reaching a limited and more flexible arrangement to avoid sanctions.
     This could entail resuming limited and reversible cooperation with the IAEA and establishing a roadmap for future talks with the US.
     However, he’s not optimistic that the E3 will extend such an offer because it would like to locate the stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium, which, in their view, is a serious nuclear proliferation threat.
     Iran, for its part, seems ready to accept a deal that grants partial access to the IAEA. Inspectors from the agency reportedly arrived in Tehran on August 27, although the Iranian government said no deal had been reached with the IAEA as of yet.
     If Iran doesn’t meet the E3’s demands, it will come under a conventional arms embargo, face restrictions on its ballistic missile development, and its top officials will have their assets frozen and travel bans issued for them.
     Most notably, Iran will be ordered by the UNSC to stop uranium enrichment, as per the JCPOA. This could give Israel and the US the legitimacy of international law to try and “enforce” this order by attacking Iran again, argues Parsi.
     “When you have a demand by the UN Security Council [saying] Iran should stop uranium enrichment, it means the US/Israel demand will suddenly have the force of international law behind it,” he told Al Jazeera.
     Azizi believes the combination of sanctions, Iran’s hidden stockpiles of enriched uranium and lack of IAEA inspections could lead to renewed conflict.
     “Israel has already demonstrated its willingness to use force again … If Iran were to resume enrichment at scale or show signs of moving toward weaponisation under the cover of opacity, the risk of another Israeli attack would rise sharply,” he told Al Jazeera.
     What’s more, Iran would be prohibited under UN resolutions from importing weapons from Russia or China, which, in theory, would make the government and its people more vulnerable to external threats.
     China and Russia could ignore the sanctions, arguing they were an abusive attempt to force Iran to give up its nuclear programme.
     UN resolutions are often ignored by the US, its allies, and other world powers to protect their interests.
     Parsi argues that the E3’s threat of restoring UN sanctions is driven more by wanting to curry favour with the Trump administration than by any real concern for de-escalating tensions in the Middle East.
     “Europeans want to get themselves on the same page with the US,” he told Al Jazeera.
     “At the end of the day, what’s far more important to the Europeans is that they maintain good relations with the US, not work [to deescalate the situation] with Iran.”

56) Macron hits back at Netanyahu over claims of fuelling anti-Semitism — Al Jazeera (2025-08-27)

     French leader responds in diplomatic row that erupted after Macron said France would recognise a Palestinian state.
     President Emmanuel Macron has rebuked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for accusing him of fuelling anti-Semitism, calling the comments an “offence to France as a whole”.
     The French leader responded to his Israeli counterpart in a letter published on Tuesday in several newspapers, in which he said Netanyahu’s recent accusations aimed at Macron were “unacceptable” and warned that the battle against anti-Semitism “must not be weaponised”.
     “Accusations of inaction in the face of a scourge that we are fighting with everything in our power are unacceptable and are an offence to France as a whole,” Macron wrote in the letter.
     “The fight against antisemitism must not be weaponised and will not fuel any discord between Israel and France.”
     The French leader also appealed to Netanyahu to bring the “murderous and illegal permanent war” in Gaza to an end, saying it was “causing indignity for your country and placing your people in a deadlock”.
     France and Israel have been embroiled in a diplomatic spat since last week, when Netanyahu accused Macron of fuelling “the anti-Semitic fire” in France by planning to recognise Palestinian statehood .
     The accusation was contained in a letter which claimed that anti-Semitism had surged in France since Macron’s recent announcement that he would recognise Palestine as a state at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly next month.
     The French president’s office responded by labelling the remarks “abject” and “erroneous”.
     “This is a time for seriousness and responsibility, not for conflation and manipulation,” the French presidency said last week, adding that violence against the Jewish community was “intolerable” and asserting that France “protects and will always protect its Jewish citizens”.
     The row has widened to draw in Israel’s chief ally, the United States, after Washington’s ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, published an open letter to Macron in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, echoing the allegation that France was failing to take sufficient action against anti-Semitism.
     Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law, was summoned to the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs over the accusations, which France said were “unacceptable”, but the US embassy’s charge d’affaires went in his place, as Kushner was absent.

57) France returns human skulls to Madagascar, 128 years after French massacre — Al Jazeera (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     One of three skulls returned to Madagascar is believed to belong to King Toera, who was slain by French colonial forces.
     France has returned to Madagascar three human skulls kept at a Paris museum for 128 years, after they were looted during the colonial period, including one believed to be that of a Madagascan king decapitated by French troops.
     The skull, presumed to be that of King Toera, and two others from the Sakalava ethnic group, were formally handed over at a ceremony held at the French Ministry of Culture on Tuesday.
     French troops beheaded King Toera during a massacre of locals in 1897, with his skull then taken back to France as a trophy, and placed in Paris’s national history museum alongside hundreds of other remains from the Indian Ocean island.
     “These skulls entered the national collections in circumstances that clearly violated human dignity and in a context of colonial violence,” French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati said at the event.
     The French minister’s Madagascar counterpart, Volamiranty Donna Mara, praised the handover, saying the taking of the skulls “has been, for more than a century, 128 years, an open wound in the heart of our island”.
     “They are not collectors’ items; they are the invisible and indelible link that unites our present to our past,” Mara said.
     Video from the event showed three boxes draped in traditional cloth being carried in a solemn procession to the handover ceremony in the ornate surroundings of France’s Culture Ministry.
     A joint scientific committee confirmed that the skulls were from the Sakalava people, but said it could only “presume” that one belonged to King Toera, Dati said.
     The event marked the first restitution of human remains since France passed a law facilitating the return of such artefacts in 2023.
     With a third of the 30,000 specimens at Paris’s Musee de l’Homme being skulls and skeletons from around the world, countries including Australia and Argentina have filed their own restitution requests for the return of ancestral remains.
     During a visit in April to the Madagascan capital, Antananarivo, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of seeking “forgiveness” for France’s “bloody and tragic” colonisation of Madagascar, which declared independence in 1960 after more than 60 years of colonial rule.
     The skulls are set to return to the Indian Ocean island on Sunday, where they will be buried.
     Minister Mara said the Madagascan government plans to honour the remains in a tribute coinciding with the anniversary of King Toera’s execution in late August 1897, during France’s colonisation of the Indian Ocean island.

2) Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General — UN Press (2025-08-29)

   Text:
     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
     All right, good afternoon.
     ** Briefing Note
     A programming note.  It will be no surprise for you to learn that Monday is a holiday in the Unites States — Labour Day, which means that we will not be working.  But obviously, as usual, we will be available to you guys electronically.
     And at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, there will be a press briefing here by Mr. Sangjin Kim, the Chargé d’affaires of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations, and he will be here to speak to you in his role as President of the Security Council for the month of September, and it will be a busy month. He will, of course, brief you on the programme of work.  Just to note that this is just in-person; there will be no zoom link for this press conference.
     ** Senior Personnel Appointment
     A personnel announcement and a travel announcement to share with you.  A senior personnel announcement.  Today, the Secretary-General is appointing Diene Keita of Guinea as the new Executive Director of the UN Population Fund — UNFPA.  She succeeds Natalia Kanem of Panama, to whom the Secretary-General is deeply grateful for her dedicated service and outstanding commitment to the United Nations and UNFPA.
     Currently serving as the Acting Executive Director of UNFPA, Ms. Keita has served as Deputy Executive Director (Programme) of that organization since 2020, bringing over three decades of experience and leadership in international development and public service.  We congratulate her.
     ** Cyprus
     The Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, María Angela Holguín Cuéllar, will travel to Cyprus next week, meeting separately with the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders, [Nikos Christodoulides and Ersin Tatar, respectively].  That will take place on 2 September.  She is also scheduled to engage with the representatives of the two leaders, the members of the Technical Committee on Youth, and the Committee on Missing Persons, among other interlocutors.
     ** Sudan
     You will have seen that earlier this morning we issued a statement on Sudan.  The Secretary-General said he is appalled by the relentless attacks by the Rapid Support Forces on El Fasher in Sudan’s North Darfur State.
     El Fasher has been under a tightening siege for more than 500 days with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the area.  Recent weeks have seen near-continuous shelling of the area and repeated deadly incursions into the Abu Shouk displacement camp, where famine conditions were identified back in December 2024.  And as a stark reminder, since 11 August, our agencies documented at least 125 civilians having been killed in the El Fasher area, including through summary executions, with the actual death toll most likely much higher.
     The Secretary-General is alarmed at the grave risks of serious violations of international humanitarian law as well as violations and abuses of international human rights law, including ethnically motivated violations.
     Supplies are pre-positioned nearby but efforts by the United Nations and our partners to move them into El Fasher continue to be hampered.
     There have been repeated attacks on humanitarian personnel and assets in North Darfur in the recent months.
     The Secretary-General calls for an immediate ceasefire in El Fasher and areas around El Fasher.  He insists that immediate steps must be taken to protect civilians and enable the safe, unhindered and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance into the area, and to allow any civilians seeking to leave the area voluntarily to do so safely.
     The Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, is continuing to engage with the warring parties.  And of course, he stands ready to support genuine efforts to halt the violence and establish an inclusive political process that the people of Sudan are demanding.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     Turning to Gaza, and I can tell you that we are concerned that the Israeli offensive on Gaza City could have an even more horrific impact on people across the Strip if it intensifies further.
     We note that the Israeli announcement today that the daily tactical pauses have been discontinued in Gaza City — and that is an area that Israel now classifies as a “dangerous combat zone”.  That suspension will further threaten people’s lives and aid workers’ ability to support people.
     Our colleagues on the ground tell us that those declared pauses appeared to signal some willingness that humanitarian work should be allowed to move forward.  Yet, in recent weeks, they still observed bombing in areas and at times where such pauses had been declared.  OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) stresses that life-saving aid operations must be further enabled and not rolled back.
     Moreover, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to move further south is a recipe for further disaster and could amount to forcible transfer.
     We and our partners are remaining in Gaza City to provide life-saving support with a commitment to serve people wherever they are. We expect our work to be fully facilitated and remind parties that civilians, including humanitarian workers, must be protected at all times.  Humanitarian facilities and other civilian infrastructure must also be safeguarded.
     OCHA tells us that aid workers continue to face impediments to their movements inside the Gaza Strip.  Yesterday, one in every four such movements — which had been fully coordinated with authorities and initially approved — faced impediments and was unable to be fully accomplished.  That’s 4 out of a total of 16.  These impediments undermined the planned collection of cargo from crossings and much-needed road repairs.
     We also have a quick correction from yesterday:  I said that 200 herders each received two 100-kilogram sacks of animal feed.  Our friends in Rome at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have clarified that each sack was 50 kilograms, not 100.
     Turning to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that they continue to see very high levels of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians — and that has obvious a harsh impact on the humanitarian situation.
     Between last Tuesday and this Monday, OCHA documented at least 15 attacks that caused injuries or property damage in 13 Palestinian communities.  Those attacks left eight Palestinians injured and forced six herding families to flee their homes — that’s 15 adults and nearly 20 displaced children.
     OCHA says that settler violence has now become one of the main drivers of displacement of Palestinians throughout the West Bank.
     Just to give you some sense:  In one pocket of Bethlehem governorate, around Barriyet Kisan, OCHA says that it has recorded at least 64 Palestinian herding families who have had to leave since October 2023 because of persistent violence and intimidation by settlers.  That’s more than 100 adults and over 80 children.  Eighteen of those families were displaced just last month, after being assaulted or threatened, or after their property was destroyed or looted.
     Home demolitions are also driving families away.  Since the start of the year and as of this Monday, 873 Palestinians — half of them children — were displaced when Israeli authorities demolished or forced the demolition of their homes for not having the Israeli-issued building permits required.
     We call again on the protection of all civilians across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to stop these demolitions — and steps must also be taken against settler violence.
     ** Lebanon
     Turning to Lebanon, and following the mandate extension by the Security Council yesterday, UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) continues to conduct its operations to advance stability in southern Lebanon and along the Blue Line.
     Yesterday, our peacekeepers found an unauthorized mortar bomb in Sector East.  The day before, they discovered a weapons cache and infrastructure in Sector East as well, including a tunnel with boxes of explosive shells stored about 15 metres underground.
     Yesterday morning, a UNIFIL patrol was subjected to aggressive behaviour in Sector West when a group of five individuals pelted stones at the patrol, causing minor damage to the vehicles.  We reiterate once again that acts that endanger the peacekeepers and hamper their work are unacceptable and must stop.
     The peacekeepers also continue to observe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) military activities, including several air strikes on Thursday in our area of operations.
     Just to highlight the risks faced in securing southern Lebanon, yesterday two Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) personnel lost their lives in an explosion in Naqoura, and others were injured.  According to the Lebanese Armed Forces, the incident occurred while its personnel were inspecting a fallen IDF drone.
     As reaffirmed by the Security Council in its resolution 2790, the parties are to ensure full respect for the Blue Line and a full cessation of hostilities.
     We reiterate that the Lebanese Armed Force's full deployment across the south is central to resolution 1701 with UNIFIL coordinating closely with the Lebanese Armed Forces in support.
     ** Syria
     Moving to Syria:  We have been following with concern the developments in the Sumariyya neighbourhood in Damascus.  Our Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, says he is closely following these developments, including the reports of threats of evictions and the reports of abuses against innocent civilians, including women and children.
     We join Mr. Pedersen in urging restraint and refraining from precipitous or violent actions.
     The Special Envoy stresses that complex issues related to housing, land and property and to transitional justice need to be addressed with care, prioritizing the protection of civilians based on the rule of law and in line with international standards.
     As for the humanitarian situation in Syria, our colleagues there tell us that a convoy loaded with aid, involving UN agencies, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other partners, successfully reached Sweida Governorate via the main highway from Damascus.  This was the first movement on that road since 12 July, as it had been closed due to clashes we have been telling you about and you know of.  Since then, convoys had been rerouted through less direct roads, adding to logistics and security challenges to those operations.
     Yesterday’s convoy included 19 trucks carrying relief items such as food baskets, hygiene kits, nutrition supplies, fuel, medical supplies, and solar lamps.  In addition, colleagues carried out needs assessments in northern rural Sweida Governorate and in the town of Salkhad.
     As of 25 August, just a few days ago, and since mid-July, humanitarian partners report that clashes in Sweida Governorate have displaced more than 187,000 human beings, and they have been displaced across southern Syria.
     We and our partners continue to scale up the response. Between July and August, 370,000 people across Sweida, Dar’a, and Rural Damascus Governorates have received some form of humanitarian assistance.
     ** Burkina Faso
     Two things I want to share with you that I am discovering as well, because there were just brought to me.  One is a statement on Burkina Faso.
     The Secretary-General has learned with regret that, on 18 August, the Burkinabe transitional authorities declared our Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator Carol Flore-[Smereczniak] persona non grata .  He expresses full confidence in her professionalism and dedication and in the broader United Nations system in Burkina Faso.
     The United Nations system, led by our Resident Coordinator, has been working closely with the Burkinabe transitional authorities to support development efforts and provide humanitarian assistance.
     The doctrine of persona non grata does not apply to United Nations officials, and we have said this repeatedly and in different contexts.  Under Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of this Organization, United Nations staff members are appointed by the Secretary-General. They are responsible only to the Organization, and UN Member States undertake to respect their exclusively international character.  In accordance with Article 105 of the Charter, there are accorded privileges and immunities, including the right of its staff members to remain in Burkina [Faso] to perform their functions on behalf of the Organization.  Only the Secretary-General, as the Chief Administrative Officer of the UN, has the authority to decide, after careful investigation, on the withdrawal of any UN official.
     The Secretary-General reaffirms the commitment of the United Nations to continue supporting the people of Burkina Faso in full cooperation with the transitional authorities.
     ** Colombia
     The UN Verification Mission in Colombia has welcomed the liberation of 33 soldiers from the Colombian armed forces who had been held against their will by local residents of a community in southern Colombia for several days amid military operations against armed groups and illicit crops in the area.  Colombia’s Minister [for Defense] thanked the Mission for its assistance in facilitating their release in the Department of Guaviare.  Citing excellent cooperation with authorities in support of the soldier's release, the Mission reiterated its continued commitment to the communities and institutions to achieve sustainable peace in the area.
     ** Haiti
     I can also tell you that we are encouraged that the Security Council is poised to take further action to improve international support for security in Haiti in response to armed gangs operating in that country.  And I think we have been giving you a clear picture of the horrendous situation that those armed gangs have caused.
     We reiterate the Secretary-General's recommendation to strengthen the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission through UN logistical and operational support funded by the UN peacekeeping budget, as well as his call for the implementation of the UN sanctions regime and decisive progress in Haiti's political process.
     We welcome the decision by Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kenya, the Bahamas and the United States to establish a Standing Group of Partners to provide high-level strategic direction, oversight, and political decision-making for any revamped security force and look forward to working closely with that Group.
     ** Nepal
     A quick update from our UN team in Nepal, where health authorities reported a suspected cholera outbreak in the Birgunj Metropolitan City a few days ago.
     National health authorities are leading the response and have activated the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene — or WASH — Cluster, with support from our UN team on the ground.
     The World Health Organization (WHO) is providing expertise in epidemiology, case investigation, lab testing, vaccination planning and information management.
     Our colleagues at UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) have also distributed water purifiers, medicines and hygiene supplies, and mobilized volunteers to engage households on prevention and safe practices.
     ** International Days
     International days, [three] very important ones.
     Today is the International Day against Nuclear Tests. In his message , the Secretary-General says that we must never forget the legacy of over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests carried out over the last 80 years, driving displacement and contaminating lands and oceans.  His message to leaders is “to silence the bombs before they speak again”.
     Tomorrow is the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, a strategy that has been used frequently to support terror within societies.
     And on Sunday, we mark the International Day for People of African Descent.  The Secretary-General says on this Day, we honour the extraordinary contributions of people of African descent across every sphere of human endeavour.  But we also recognise enduring injustices.  Three very important days.
     ** Andrea Tenenti
     Two more items.  And I know it’s Friday and you want to get out of here, but I do want to salute the retirement of a legendary spokesman.
     Our friend and colleague Andrea Tenenti has been, give or take a few years, the voice and the face of UNIFIL since the paint was still wet on the markers along the Blue Line.
     Throughout his years at UNIFIL, Andrea has been consistent in his professionalism, his passion and his belief in the UN’s Mission.
     We wish him a future with clear blue skies and calm all around and no phones.
     ** Financial Contribution
     Finally, we have money.  We have a quiz for you.
     This country that has paid today is known for having the most pyramids in the world.  [responses from the crowd]  Not Mexico, not Egypt.  Sudan, exactly.
     So today we thank our friends in Khartoum for their full payment to the Regular Budget.  We are now up to fully paid-up 122 Member States.  Dezhi, you won.  Sorry, Edie.
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Sorry, Edie.  I have several questions.  Well first of all, the US State Department just issued the statement saying that it's denying and revoking visas for members of the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and the Palestinian Authority before the UN General Assembly in September. Any reaction from the Secretary-General on this announcement?
     Spokesman :  We've learned of this, just like you, through the press statements.  We're obviously going to follow up.  We'll discuss these matters with the State Department in line with the UN Headquarters Agreement between the UN and the US.
     Question :  And yesterday, there are more than 500 staffers in the Office for High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote a letter, signed a letter to ask Mr. [Voler] Türk to describe the Gaza war as a genocide.  Any comments from the Secretary-General on the behaviour of the staff? [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  One of your colleagues asked me the same question yesterday.  I'm happy to repeat my answer, which is, first of all, the Secretary-General's full and complete confidence in the work of Volker Türk as High Commissioner for Human Rights.  To reiterate something we have said hundreds of times here, the labelling of an event as a genocide for us is up to a competent legal, judicial authority. I think, if people paid attention, they would see how vocal Volker Türk has been about the horrors going on in Gaza. And they will also take note of the rather direct and pointed criticism from the Israeli authorities for everything that he said.
     Question :  Sorry.  One last thing.
     Spokesman :  Sure.
     Question :  The Grand National Assembly of Türkiye today adopted a motion, urged UN to suspend the membership of Israel until it's changed its policy on Gaza.  My question is there a way to really suspend?
     Spokesman :  I would encourage you to read the Charter, and all of that is left up to Member States.  Edie Lederer and then Amelie.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Does the Secretary-General have any comment on the announcement by the White House today that it's blocking $4.9 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress, including $520 million for the UN regular budget and other organizations such as UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), as well as $838 million for international peacekeeping?
     Spokesman :  I mean, we've obviously learned of this like you all did.  We saw the press reports.  We saw the actual announcement.  What can I tell you?  This is going to make our budget situation, our liquidity situation that much more challenging, but we will follow up with US authorities to get more details.
     Question :  And secondly, on the Resident Coordinator in Burkina Faso being declared persona non grata , I wasn't clear from what you said whether she is staying in Burkina Faso or is she leaving?
     Spokesman :  No.  She left the country a few days ago.  Amelie?
     Question :  Edie asked my question.
     Spokesman :  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Linda, would you ask a question that Dezhi has not asked, and we'll go to Gabriel.
     Question :  That's going to be hard.  […]
     Spokesman :  Go ahead.
     Question :  Okay.  Turning to Yemen.  I was just wondering what the status is of UN efforts to get, you know, UN staff, diplomats, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), sailors, and all kinds of people released by the Houthis?
     Spokesman :  I mean, we continue to advocate publicly.  We continue to advocate privately, including through contacts with Member States who may have a more direct line to Ansar Allah and the Houthis.  And we continue to bring their plight to attention.  I think our colleagues who briefed on Yemen talk about it all the time, and we will not forget our colleagues and others who remain in legally detained.  Your microphone?
     Question :  Is there some kind of formal mechanism that's there?  Is it Iran that you’re asking for help?  [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  I mean, the mechanism being the…  [cross-talk]  We've raised this in discussions with Iranian authorities.  This is issue that our Resident Coordinator raises.  This is issues that Mr. [Hans] Grundberg, our Special Envoy, raises.  We hope that they'd be released.  They deserve to be released immediately.  Gabriel?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Would the US preventing President [Mahmoud] Abbas from speaking at the UN General Assembly violate the UN Headquarters Agreement?
     Spokesman :  We are going to discuss this with the State Department.  I mean, the Headquarters Agreement deserves to be read — notably, I think, sections 11 and 12.  We obviously hope that this will be resolved.  It is important that all Member States, permanent observers, be able to be represented — especially, I think in this case, as we know, with the upcoming two-State solution meeting that France and Saudi Arabia will host at the beginning of the GA.
     Question :  Would the Secretary-General like the US Government to revoke this decision?
     Spokesman :  Well, obviously, we would like to see all diplomats and delegates who are entitled to come here to be able to travel freely.  Iftikhar, I see you.  Iftikhar, I think you've just turned off your camera.  Alright.  Any question?  Oh, Iftikhar, go ahead.  There we go. Go ahead.
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  Any update on the floods in Pakistan?  And now it is a deluge with 250,000 people displaced.
     Spokesman :  I have not received any updates today, but we will ask our humanitarian colleagues to give you something before close of business.
     Question :  Thank you.
     Spokesman :  All right.  Yes, sir?
     Question :  Sorry.  I know you won't.
     Spokesman :  All right.  One more question.  Don't move.
     Question :  I just had a quick question for you.  The Iranian Foreign Ministry said today in a statement that the move by the E3 to implement a snapback mechanism of resolution 2231 will gravely undermine its ongoing cooperation with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency).  Just any reactions?
     Spokesman :  Well, I think as I said yesterday, we very much hope that this window of opportunity will be used for diplomacy to resolve all outstanding issues, and that the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue its cooperation with the IAEA.  Okay.  Dezhi sorry.  You raised your hand.  [cross-talk]
     Question :  We don't have briefing on Monday, or do we have?
     Spokesman :  Dezhi, you were just…
     Question :  I was late.  I was late. [cross-talk]
     Spokesman :  You were not listening to…  you have access to your office.  You're more welcome to come in here on Monday.  You will be alone.  [laughter]

3) Brutal Escalation of Large-Scale Russian Federation Attacks on Ukraine Setting Grim Casualty Records, Jeopardizing Fragile Diplomatic Momentum, Security Council Hears — UN Press (2025-08-29)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16160.doc.htm
   Text:
     Warning that the Ukrainian people caught in the crossfire are “entering the fourth winter of the full-scale war”, a top UN official told the Security Council today that the Russian Federation’s large-scale escalation of attacks against civilians persist, killing children, setting grim casualty records and jeopardizing fragile diplomatic momentum.
     Miroslav Jenča, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas at the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the Secretary-General on Thursday condemned Moscow’s deadly overnight missile and drone attacks.  “Yesterday’s strikes are only the latest in the brutal escalation of country-wide aerial attacks,” he said.
     Ukrainian officials reported that, between 27 and 28 August alone, 598 drones and 31 missiles were launched, killing at least 23 people in Kyiv, including 4 children.
     Mr. Jenča stressed the expanding scope of violence, saying these strikes targeted regions far from the front lines.  “In July, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded rising civilian casualties across 18 regions of Ukraine,” he told the 15-member Council, with July setting a record of 1,674 casualties — the highest since May 2022.
     Since the invasion began, 14,054 civilians, including 730 children, have been killed, while more than 36,000 have been injured, he said, also acknowledging the conflict’s spillover into the Russian Federation where there have been civilian casualties in Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk.
     On 24 August, “a fire broke out after a Ukrainian drone was shot down near the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant”, damaging a transformer, he said. While the UN could not verify all reports of Ukrainian strikes inside the Russian Federation, Mr. Jenča cautioned: “The growing impact of the conflict on the civilian population in the Russian Federation is of concern, too.”  All attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure violate international humanitarian law, he reiterated.
     Underscoring that preparations are under way to provide targeted winter support for 1.7 million people in need, he stressed:  “Scaled up and flexible donor support is urgently needed” to continue to provide life-saving operations.
     Mr. Jenča also welcomed recent meetings in Anchorage and Washington, D.C., but warned that, as large-scale attacks against civilians persist, “the current diplomatic momentum is at risk of rapidly fading”.  He closed by reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire one that fully upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
     In the ensuing discussion, Council Members condemned the Russian Federation’s latest attack on Ukraine, with Slovenia’s delegate emphasizing that Moscow’s second-largest air assault of the war on 28 August saw 620 drones and missiles launched mostly at Kyiv, destroying residential buildings and damaging the European Union delegation and British Council premises.  These are “not military targets”, but densely populated areas, she stressed.
     The delegate of France also condemned in the “strongest possible terms” Moscow’s latest strikes, calling them “unacceptable”.  Recalling that President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has “shown his availability to implement an immediate, unconditional ceasefire” and willingness to engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, he said that Moscow has instead responded with more deadly strikes.  “Russia says it believes in peace and diplomacy; such brutal attacks say the opposite,” the delegate from the United Kingdom added.
     Other Council members underscored how the war in Ukraine was affecting regions beyond Europe, with the Republic of Korea’s representative voicing concern over the ongoing Moscow–Pyongyang military cooperation that is exacerbating the war’s severity and its bleak ramifications.  Algeria’s delegate noted the conflict’s impact on food and energy markets causing soaring prices in her country, region and beyond.  “The cost of this conflict, while borne most heavily by the Ukrainian people, is also being paid by the entire region and global community,” added Guyana’s speaker, echoing calls for an urgent intensification of diplomatic dialogue to end the conflict.
     “The Ukraine issue is entering a critical stage for negotiated settlement,” stated China’s delegate.  He welcomed ongoing talks, noting the continued engagement of all relevant parties towards a solution, expressing hope that the parties concerned will “meet each other halfway and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiation”.
     The United States representative stated that, in recent weeks, Washington, D.C., has undertaken “exceptional efforts to bring the Russian-Ukrainian war to an end”.  On 15 August, President Donald J. Trump met face to face with President Putin in Alaska — the first summit-level meeting between the two countries since Moscow launched its invasion over three years ago.  Building on that progress, President Trump then hosted President Zelenskyy and seven other European leaders at the White House on 18 August.
     However, the latest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine “cast doubts on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace”, he pointed out, underscoring that such strikes on civilian areas must stop immediately.  “Russia must decide now to move towards peace,” he asserted, urging the leaders of both countries to agree to meet bilaterally, warning of further economic measures with “far-reaching consequences” should Moscow choose to prolong the war.
     The speaker for the Russian Federation dismissed Western accusations as a “fairly primitive template” over its 28 August strikes, insisting its attacks targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex”, including arms depots, airfields and UAV factories, not civilians.  Rather, civilian deaths resulted from Ukrainian air defences placed in residential areas, he said, accusing Kyiv of “shamelessly and criminally” using Ukrainians as “human shields”.  The tragedies are being “intentionally whipped up to blame the deaths of Ukrainian civilians on Russia” to secure more Western arms and sanctions, he said.  Moscow further accused the West of hypocrisy, ignoring Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian cities that killed and wounded scores of civilians in late August.
     He also alleged rampant corruption and repression inside Ukraine, citing reports of political prisoners, restrictions on the Orthodox Church and off-shore assets tied to President Zelenskyy’s circle.  He said the West’s selective blindness undermines its credibility, while reiterating demands for security guarantees that address the Russian Federation’s concerns.  He accused Kyiv of “skyrocketing human rights violations”.  Referring to the Alaska Summit, he said his Government remains open to negotiations, but only on terms that exclude North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion and recognize Russian Federation interests, accusing Kyiv of blocking compromise and pursuing “PR over diplomacy”.
     Yulia Svyrydenko, Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the Council that the Russian Federation’s 28 August assault marked one of the deadliest nights of the war, with “629 airborne weapons” launched against cities, killing 25 people — including 4 children — and wounding 63 others.  Among the victims was a girl “not yet three years old, born under Russian shelling in October 2022, and killed by Russian shelling in August 2025”, she said.  The strikes, which also damaged the European Union Delegation and British Council premises, were “deliberate acts of terror”, she said, demanding stronger air defence and long-range capabilities to protect civilians, alongside tougher sanctions to deprive Moscow of funds for its war.
     Prime Minister Svyrydenko also highlighted the Russian Federation’s systematic abduction of children, citing cases of forced adoption and identity erasure.  “Russia kills children from a distance with missiles and drones, and those who fall under its control it steals,” she said.  She urged the Council to act, insisting that peace requires both bolstering its defence and intensifying pressure on Moscow until it shows genuine willingness to negotiate.  “Aggression must be punished, never rewarded,” she declared, reaffirming readiness for a just, lasting peace based on sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law.
     Several European countries took to the floor, as well, expressing support for Ukraine and condemning the Russian Federation’s attacks, with Poland’s speaker stating that, if Moscow hopes to break the spirit of resistance and solidarity, it is “gravely mistaken”.  “Recent strikes only strengthen our determination to support Ukraine,” he said, urging allies to impose restrictive measures that will further undercut Moscow’s revenues and weaken its capacity to wage war.
     “Putin does not seek even a temporary ceasefire, let alone a lasting peace,” said Estonia’s delegate, speaking also for Latvia and Lithuania.  She stressed that the Russian Federation must be held fully accountable for the crime of aggression and “for every war crime committed”.  Perpetrators must face justice, including through a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression.  “There can be no lasting peace without accountability,” she added.
     “Once again, Russia has demonstrated its complete disregard for civilian lives — and diplomatic missions,” said Norway’s delegate, speaking also for Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden.  Citing a ceasefire as “the necessary first step”, he noted that Ukraine has been ready for a ceasefire for several months while “Russia stands in the way”. However, peace in Ukraine cannot be negotiated without Ukraine’s participation, and “security guarantees will be needed”, he stressed, adding that the people of Ukraine require peace in accordance with international law, “not a pause for Russia to prepare for renewed aggression”.
     The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, said that, as high-level talks for peace are ongoing, Moscow has launched yet another massive and brutal overnight attack against Ukrainian cities and civilians.  Ordinary civilians — including children as young as two years old — have paid the ultimate price of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and illegal aggression.  “Such blatant violations of international law and the inviolability of diplomatic premises only strengthen our resolve to stand with Ukraine and its people,” he asserted.
     “The latest missile attack on Kyiv on 27 August is not a mistake,” stressed Romania’s delegate, adding that it was followed less than 24 hours later by a drone attack on a Ukrainian ship on the Danube Delta, near the Romanian border and near the Black Sea.  “These continuous attacks are not the path to peace.  And we need peace,” he emphasized.
     In the aftermath of the latest attacks, said Germany’s delegate, “we have to ask ourselves:  What is Russia’s intention?”  For weeks and months, that country’s leaders and diplomats have been claiming to seek negotiations and peace.  But, at the same time, they relentlessly launch rockets into residential areas of Ukraine.  Underscoring the need to respect the territorial integrity of UN Member States, he said Berlin — together with its allies — will support Ukraine in its right to defend itself “as long as it takes”.  He stated:  “Every night the people of Ukraine have to spend in fear is one too much.  It is time to act.”

4) Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
     ** Guest Today
     Just in a short while, I will be joined by Edem Wosornu who is as you know is the Director of Operations and Advocacy at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and she will be here to brief you on her recent visit and travels to Sudan and Chad.
     ** Secretary-General’s Travels
     Speaking of travels, later tonight, the Secretary-General will travel to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Leaders’ Summit taking place in Tianjin.  At the summit, on Monday, the Secretary-General will address the "SCO-plus" session.  He’s expected to recall that as we are moving towards a multipolar world, we need to strengthen multilateralism, uphold the rule of law, and deliver for people – as reflected in the Pact for the Future.  He is expected to underline the unique position of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to help shape a more inclusive and sustainable future.
     While in Tianjin, the Secretary-General is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with President Xi [Jinping], the President of the People’s Republic of China, as well as with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, Wang Yi.  He is also expected to have a number of other bilaterals with leaders attending the meeting. We will share an update on those bilaterals as they happen.
     On Tuesday, 2 September, the Secretary-General will arrive in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.  At the invitation of Prime Minister James Marape, the Secretary-General will take part in events to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Papua New Guinea’s independence.
     On Wednesday, 3 September, the Secretary-General is scheduled to deliver an address to the Parliament, during which he will highlight how in just 50 years, in a land of over 800 languages and countless traditions, the people of Papua New Guinea have undertaken the task of forging a nation from profound diversity, with a shared commitment to speak with one voice for peace, for dignity and for progress.
     He will also emphasize that this is his first trip to the Pacific since the landmark advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) — in which the region played a central role.  You will recall that the opinion affirms that addressing the climate crisis is a legal obligation under international law. And finally, just to note that this will be the first visit to Papua New Guinea ever by a sitting UN Secretary-General. The Secretary-General will be back in New York on 6 September.
     ** Deputy Secretary-General/Chile
     Our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, is in Santiago, Chile at the invitation of the Government.  This morning, she delivered remarks at the World Summit on Teachers, organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Government of Chile.  Ms. Mohammed highlighted the future of teaching in the age of Artificial Intelligence, the global shortage of teachers, and the ongoing education financing crisis.  She also spoke about the challenges faced by teachers in conflict settings.
     The Deputy Secretary-General stressed that quality education is the foundation of everything the world hopes to achieve through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda:  healthy lives, a healthy planet, opportunities, a sense of belonging, equality and peace.  She also emphasized that, without teachers, none of it is possible, adding that teachers are the beating heart of education, the cornerstone of sustainable development and the guardians of our future, and we must support them.
     While in Santiago, she held bilateral meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, Alberto van Klaveren Stork, and with Minister for Education of Chile, Nicolás Cataldo Astorga.  She also met with the UN country team, as well as youth and civil society representatives, listening to their perspectives on their priorities, challenges, and opportunities around sustainable development, human rights, and partnerships.  Ms. Mohammed will be back in New York City tomorrow.
     ** Gaza
     In remarks delivered to you this morning, the Secretary-General said that Israel’s initial steps to militarily take over Gaza City signals a new and dangerous phase.  Expanded military operations in Gaza City will have devastating consequences, he warned. Mr. [António] Guterres said that the levels of death and destruction in Gaza are without parallel in recent times.  Famine is no longer a looming possibility — it is a present-day catastrophe, he added. The Secretary-General said that starvation of the civilian population must never be used as a method of warfare.
     ** Occupied Palestinian Territory
     And turning to the situation actually on the ground as we speak in Gaza, our humanitarian colleagues are deeply concerned about the risk of a looming Israeli offensive on additional parts of Gaza City.  Some neighbourhoods have already seen deadly attacks in recent days.  Our humanitarian colleagues say the impact of a full-blown offensive would be beyond catastrophic — not only for those in the city but for the entire Gaza Strip.
     Our colleagues tracking population movements report that about 1,300 people fled from northern to southern Gaza yesterday and today. That brings the total number of north-south movements since 14 August — which is the day the plan for the offensive was announced — to 20,000.  Displacement is also happening within the north itself.  Altogether, since 14 August, some 60,000 displacements originating from Gaza City have been recorded.
     Across the Gaza Strip, hundreds of thousands of families continue to live in overcrowded, undignified and unsafe conditions at displacement sites.  Today, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Executive Director, Cindy McCain, called for faster approvals to move supplies into and within Gaza, as well as for safety for people to reach aid, and for humanitarian workers to reach those who need support.  Ms. McCain also made this statement after visiting the Gaza Strip, where she saw the destruction and desperation firsthand.
     With famine now confirmed in Gaza Governorate, Ms. McCain called for the right conditions to be put in place so WFP can reinstate its vast network of 200 food-distribution points, community kitchens and bakeries. She visited a nutrition clinic that’s keeping children alive and spoke with displaced mothers who described their daily struggle to survive, often searching for scraps of food but finding nothing.  As WFP noted, there has been a moderate increase in the amount of humanitarian and commercial goods entering the Strip.  But, this is still far below what’s needed to support 2 million people, many of them in extreme hunger.
     On a positive note, yesterday, for the first time since March, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was able to provide vital animal feed to herders in Deir al Balah.  They announced that 200 herders received two 100-kilogramme sacks each — a crucial step to protect livestock and help curb the spread of famine.
     Meanwhile, OCHA says that delays and impediments of humanitarian movements within Gaza continue, with movements that are approved by Israeli authorities still taking hours to complete.  Teams have been left waiting on roads that are often dangerous, congested, or impassable.
     Between last Wednesday and this Tuesday, out of 89 attempts to coordinate movements with Israeli authorities across the Gaza Strip, only 59 per cent were facilitated.  Another 26 per cent were initially approved, but then impeded on the ground, 8 per cent were denied outright and 7 per cent had to be withdrawn by the organizers.  Among the 23 impeded movements, 5 were fully accomplished, including to collect supplies from crossings and medically evacuate patients. The remaining 18 missions were not fully accomplished.
     ** Lebanon
     And like all of you, we have just seen the Security Council adopt unanimously a new resolution that extends for a final time the mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as it was set out by resolution 1701 (2006) until 31 December 2026.  At the request of the Security Council, the Secretary-General will explore, by 1 June 2026, options for the future of the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) after the withdrawal of UNIFIL.  Acknowledging the changed situation on the ground and as requested by the Security Council, UNIFIL will continue conducting its operations in support of the implementation by the parties of resolution 1701 (2006) until the end of its mandate.
     On 31 December 2026, the Mission will start within one year to carry out its orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal, with the aim of making the Government of Lebanon the sole provider of security in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL’s liquidation will begin after the conclusion of the drawdown and withdrawal phase.  I can confirm to you that we will cooperate closely, obviously, with the Governments of Lebanon and Israel to ensure a safe and orderly transition in our area of operations.  The United Nations Department of Peace Operations (DPO) will also closely engage with the troop-contributing countries to coordinate UNIFIL’s forthcoming withdrawal. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting the parties in their efforts to fully implement resolution 1701 (2006) and take the necessary steps towards a permanent ceasefire and lasting stability for the people on both sides of the Blue Line.
     ** Ukraine
     Turning to Ukraine:  Today, the Secretary-General held a phone call with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  The Secretary-General and the President discussed the recent diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.  The Secretary-General stressed the importance of sustaining the diplomatic momentum and reaffirmed the United Nations’ principled position in support of a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire as a first step towards a just, comprehensive and sustainable peace for Ukraine, in line with the UN Charter, international law and relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  The Secretary-General further reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to continue to address Ukraine’s humanitarian needs on the ground and support recovery and reconstruction efforts.
     You will have seen that earlier this morning, we issued a statement in which the Secretary-General condemned the overnight missile and drone attacks by the Russian Federation on Ukrainian cities, which killed and injured many civilians, including children.  The Secretary-General stressed that attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure violate international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must end immediately.  That full statement was shared with you.
     And on the ground, Mattias Schmale, the Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator for Ukraine, also condemned the attacks, stressing that they highlight the constant danger facing civilians in Kyiv and cities across Ukraine. And I also have some more details about the situation on the ground from our teams there.  They tell us that at least 15 people were killed and 40 injured in the overnight attacks by the Russian Federation on the capital, Kyiv. According to authorities, the strikes destroyed a five-story building and damaged more than 100 residential buildings, a kindergarten, a shopping centre, media offices, the premises of humanitarian organizations, and also damaged the offices of the European Union Delegation and the British Council.  The Ukrainian Railway Company also reported damage to their facilities and intercity trains.
     Humanitarians and local authorities responded immediately. Humanitarian organizations provided psychosocial support and began registering impacted families for cash assistance, while local authorities arranged temporary shelter for people who lost their homes.
     Meanwhile, hostilities in front-line regions continue. Local authorities report that six people were killed and dozens injured yesterday and today.  Damage to civilian infrastructure was also reported in the regions of Kherson, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro.  In the region of Vinnytsia, authorities reported that strikes on energy infrastructure left some 60,000 households without electricity across 30 towns and villages.  This follows earlier attacks on energy facilities in six regions, heightening the concerns ahead of winter.  And in Donetsk, nearly 200 people, including 50 children, were evacuated over the past days due to escalating fighting.
     ** Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
     A number of you this morning have asked me about the letter sent from France, Germany and the United Kingdom to the President of the Security Council in accordance with resolution 2231 (2015).  I can tell you that the Secretary-General is aware that today [28 August], the Security Council received this joint letter from the three countries.
     The Secretary-General urges the JCPOA participants and the Security Council to continue negotiations to find a diplomatic solution that ensures the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme and brings about economic benefits to the people of Iran.  In the next 30 days, there is a window of opportunity to avoid any further escalation and find a way forward that serves peace.  The Secretary-General welcomes any efforts towards that end.  He also underscores the imperative to exert all efforts to prevent a renewed military conflict and calls for prioritizing dialogue to address concerns related to Iran’s nuclear programme and broader regional security.
     ** Haiti
     This morning, if you remember that far, the Secretary-General briefed a Security Council session on the humanitarian situation in Haiti. The people of Haiti, he said, are in a perfect storm of suffering, he said as he reminded Council members that the country remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded.  Turning to the plight of children.  The Secretary-General said children are bearing the brunt of this crisis.  They are abducted, they are killed, they are recruited and they are used, and they are subjected to horrific sexual violence, including gang rape.  These are crimes that scar bodies, minds and futures, he told Council members.
     On the political situation, the Secretary-General noted emerging signals of hope.  He urged the Council to act without delay and authorize an international force, supported by the United Nations through logistical and operational backing and predictable financing.  Voluntary contributions to the Multinational Security Support Trust Fund remain essential, but assessed support would ensure impact and sustainability, he said.
     Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s Executive Director, also briefed and said one of the defining features of the crisis in Haiti is the rampant rights violations against children.  She asked Council members to use all available leverage to protect children, and to demand that all armed groups end attacks on schools and hospitals, immediately release children from their ranks and allow secure, unimpeded access for humanitarian workers to safely reach communities.  And she called on donors to show solidarity with the Haitian people and contribute to funding appeals.  And as you will recall, Haiti is the least funded of all of our humanitarian appeals.
     ** Sustainable Development Goals Advocates
     Also just to announce that the Secretary-General welcomes two new SDG Advocates:  Masai Ujiri, Co-Founder of Giants of Africa and former Vice-Chairman and President of the Toronto Raptors, and also appointed Muniba Mazari, an award-winning advocate for disability rights, inclusion and gender equality.  Mr. Ujiri uses basketball as a transformative tool to create opportunities for youth across Africa and beyond.  And Ms. Mazari uses her voice and platform to champion marginalized communities.  Our Advocates for the SDGs are influential leaders who support the Secretary-General in raising global ambition and action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The group is chaired by Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados.  That’s it.  Gabriel?
     ** Questions and Answers
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  On the JCPOA, you know we have this 30-day window, as you alluded to.  We all know what happens at the end of September here. Is the Secretary-General thinking… what's his thinking in terms of perhaps convening some diplomacy under his good offices, when all the world leaders are here before that 30-day deadline kicks in?
     Spokesman :  I'm sure this will be an issue raised in a number of bilateral that the Secretary-General will have.  The decision now is up to Security Council members, but I think as I've just stated, there is that window, right? And we hope that all JCPOA participants will use that window to avoid any further escalation.
     Question :  And on UNIFIL, if I may, we've all read the resolution, so I'm not going to ask specifically about that.  But, what is the SG's thinking in terms of 2027?  Is that the wind-down period for the entire year, or how does he view that year?
     Spokesman :  Yeah.  I mean, it goes you know, the mandate will end at the end of 2026, then there is a withdrawal period and then the liquidation period.  I mean, it's sort of standard operating procedure.  We saw it with our Mission in Mali.  That being said, he will present, very soon, options to the Council on how to continue to implement 1701.  I mean, UNIFIL is a key element at this moment in the implementation of 1701.  And as we tell you every day, almost every day, there's progress being made, right?  I mean, the weapons caches, this stability, more or less, but more than less, along the Blue Line since the November ceasefire was agreed upon.  Dezhi?
     Question :  Also on UNIFIL, today in the Security Council chamber, we heard some Member States, they said that some of the mandates of UNIFIL haven't yet to be met, have been failed to meet.  And also Israeli Government obviously criticized UNIFIL also failing of, you know, disarm Hizbullah.  So, I just sort of want to know, what is the Secretary-General's reaction on this?
     Spokesman :  Well, the best way for UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate is for all parties in the conflict to allow it to fulfil its mandate.
     Question :  But oh, sorry… this Monday, I asked you that Secretary-General has a strong preference of not to end the operation, but you said it’s in the wise hands of these members of the Security Council to decide.  What does he think about this result?
     Spokesman :  Listen.  The Council… this is the organization that he runs, right?  The Security Council creates and de-creates peacekeeping missions. They've taken a decision, but let's look on the more positive side:  that there is an extension until the end of 2026.  There will be options presented to the Council on how to continue to implement 1701, because 1701 remains a very relevant resolution and it remains a very relevant part of our effort, along with the parties to bring stability to southern Lebanon.  Stefano Vaccara?
     Question :  Thank you, Stéphane.  This morning when the Secretary-General closed his speech on the stakeout, he says, no, you know, he said no more excuses, no more obstacles, no more lies. What can we know exactly what he was referring about the lies?  Who is…?
     Spokesman :  The truth is one of the first victims of war.  And what we've always repeatedly called for, especially in this conflict, is for journalists to be allowed in to report, to ensure that people know the truth about what is going on.
     Question :  But for the Secretary-General, what is the biggest lie that in this conflict has been?
     Spokesman :  I'm not going to start to rank disinformation.
     Question :  And then another question on what we just saw with the Russian Ambassador and what's going on with the Iran sanctions.  The Russian Ambassador at one point, answering a question, said that the action of Germany, France and UK is equivalent to gangsters.  Must say they’re just gangsters and doing what they're doing.  So, what is the Secretary-General’s opinion on what's going on with Iran in this moment about this issue of sanctions?
     Spokesman :  Well, I think I just shared it with you.
     Correspondent :  Yeah.  But, he's, in this case… I'm just saying, you know, the Russian calling the Germans gangsters…
     Spokesman :  I will be the last person to insert myself in the colourful dialogue between Security Council members.  Yes, please?
     Question :  Thank you, Steph.  I wanted to ask a slightly different question about the letter sent on behalf of more than 500 OHCHR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] workers to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, chief Volker Türk.  The letter urges the chief to publicly describe the war in Gaza as a genocide, saying his office's failure to do so undermines the global rights-protection system.  Just curious if there were any comments by the SG.
     Spokesman :  I think the High Commissioner has been extremely vocal, extremely strong about what was going on in Gaza.  I can tell you that he has the full and unconditional support of the Secretary-General.  As we've said here repeatedly, for the UN, the labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal authority.  And I think, if you look at the criticism that Mr. Türk has faced from the Israeli Government, I think that should give you a pretty good picture of his position on Gaza.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  And then we'll go to our guests.
     Question :  The US ambassador said that the US and Panama would table a draft resolution on the next Haiti force.  I wanted to know whether this new force is a replacement of the MSS or it's kind of a… what's the format of this new arrangement?
     Spokesman :  My understanding is that this isn't… listen.  Let me take a look at the… I misspoke yesterday when I answered a question on the Council in Iran.  I don't want to do it today, so I'll get you an answer on that.  Alright.  I'd like you to stay in your seats, and I will go get my guest.

5) United Nations Palestinian Rights Committee Bureau Denounces E1 Settlement Plan, Demands Immediate Halt of All Illegal Settlement Activity — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     The following statement was issued today by the Bureau of the General Assembly’s Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People:
     The Bureau of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People rejects and condemns the Israeli Government’s so-called E1 settlement plan in the occupied East Jerusalem.  The approval of over 3,400 illegal housing units in a critical area linking East Jerusalem with Ramallah and Bethlehem, and connecting the northern and southern West Bank, strikes at the heart of Palestinian territorial continuity, severely restricting and violating the freedom of movement and further fragmenting and isolating Palestinian communities.  This illegal plan must be stopped.
     The Committee Bureau demands that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately halt all settlement activities, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and all annexation measures.  The UN Security Council, in its resolution 2334 (2016), declared Israeli settlements flagrant violation under international law demanding Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities.  Moreover, it called on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967, which the Committee Bureau reminds that Israel has absolutely no sovereignty rights in, as affirmed by the International Court of Justice in its 19 July 2024 Advisory Opinion.
     By severing East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, this illegal settlement plan endangers the viability and existence of the Palestinian State and further entrenches Israel’s illegal occupation, paving the way for further forced displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian population.  This blatant land grab constitutes a grave breach of international law and is a direct challenge to decades of international consensus.  It comes at a moment when East Jerusalem is already under siege, with families deprived of their homes, livelihoods and rights and the Palestinian presence in the city endangered.
     The resumption of the High-Level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution at the United Nations on 22 September, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, presents a timely and vital opportunity for decisive action, to reiterate the international community’s steady commitment to the two-State solution and mobilize renewed international support towards ending the Israeli unlawful occupation.  The UN Palestinian Rights Committee stands ready to contribute actively to this effort and strongly supports the objectives of the Conference.  Our goal remains clear:  the full realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, their right to return, and continue contributing to the two-State solution — Israel and an independent, contiguous, viable and sovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 lines, in conformity with the relevant UN resolutions.

6) Amid Relentless Armed Violence, Collapsing Schools, Hospitals, Haiti Facing ‘Perfect Storm of Suffering’, Secretary-General Warns Security Council — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     Amid relentless armed violence, collapsing schools and hospitals, and a worsening humanitarian crisis leaving millions at risk, the UN Chief warned the Security Council today that Haiti faces a “perfect storm of suffering”, with children enduring unprecedented levels of forced recruitment, sexual violence and hunger.
     “Civilians [in Haiti] are under siege,” said Secretary-General António Guterres, stressing that State authority is crumbling as gang violence engulfs Port-au-Prince and spreads beyond — paralysing daily life and forcing 1.3 million people to flee.  Reports detail rape and sexual violence, repeated attacks on hospitals and schools, and the collapse of the rule of law.  With 6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, Haiti ranks among the five global hunger hotspots of “highest concern”.
     Aid workers, especially local responders, face threats of violence, extortion and kidnapping.  Despite the danger, they continue delivering food, water, medicine and shelter — reaching 1.3 million people in the first quarter of this year alone. “Yet, Haiti remains shamefully overlooked and woefully underfunded”, he stressed, noting that $908 million is required in 2025 to support 3.9 million people, yet less than 10 per cent has been received — making Haiti the least-funded humanitarian appeal worldwide. “This is not a funding gap.  It is a life-and-death emergency,” he asserted, urging donors to act before lifesaving operations grind to a halt.
     Citing his annual report on children and armed conflict, he said Haiti ranked among the top five countries for grave violations against children in 2024:  the UN verified 2,269 such violations against 1,373 children — nearly five times more than the previous year.  Children are being abducted, killed, recruited and subjected to horrific sexual violence, including gang rape.  “These are crimes that scar bodies, minds and futures,” he said.  With basic services collapsing and mass displacement worsening, children are left without education, healthcare, or safety.
     The 2024 Handover Protocol between the UN and Haiti’s Government is “an important step” towards protecting children detained for alleged association with armed groups, he said.  However, he warned of the growing threat posed by so-called community self-defence groups — some aligned with police forces — implicated in grave violations, including the summary execution of children.  He urged all authorities to implement the Handover Protocol nationwide.
     While the political situation remains fragile, there are “emerging signals of hope”, including increased cooperation between the President of the Transitional Presidential Council and the Prime Minister, who are leading consultations to advance the political process.  Coordinated international security support, he stressed, is essential to bolster national efforts, protect civilians and create conditions for a return to the rule of law and credible, inclusive elections.
     Welcoming efforts to advance his proposal to strengthen the Multinational Security Support mission through UN logistical and operational support, he urged the Council to swiftly authorize an international force with UN backing and predictable financing.  Security measures, he emphasized, “must go hand-in-hand with increased pressure on those fuelling the violence” through an effective arms embargo and targeted sanctions against gang leaders, financiers and arms traffickers.
     “With unity inside the country, and resolve from this Council, the Haitian people can emerge from the perfect storm, begin to turn hardship into hope, and reclaim their future,” he concluded.
     Presenting a detailed briefing on the grave and widespread violations of children’s rights, Catherine Russell, Executive Director, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said: “Haiti’s children continue to endure unimaginable suffering amidst the brutal armed violence.”  The recruitment and use of children by armed groups is rampant, she stressed, estimating that children currently account for a staggering 50 per cent of the armed groups’ members.  Children are being forced into combat roles, directly participating in armed confrontations, and subjected to appalling sexual violence that has reached “unprecedented levels”.
     In 2024, reported cases of sexual violence against children rose by 1,000 per cent over 2023, she noted, with over a quarter involving gang rapes.  “This constitutes a widespread campaign to terrorize communities and inflict lasting physical and psychological trauma on children,” she said, emphasizing that girls account for most victims and survivors.
     Amid this devastating reality, UNICEF and partners are being denied access to deliver humanitarian assistance.  Armed groups, she said, are preventing aid from reaching the 1.6 million children and women in areas under their control.  Last month, six UNICEF staff members were taken hostage during a lifesaving mission — although later released, the incident highlights the dangers humanitarian workers face.
     Despite these obstacles, UNICEF continues to deliver lifesaving aid.  So far this year, together with partners, it has treated 21,000 children for severe wasting, provided healthcare to 117,000 people and ensured access to safe water for 140,000.  “Today, I ask all Members of this Council to use all available leverage to protect children and to support concrete actions to prevent further violations,” she said.
     Silent Condemnation of Entire Generation of Children
     The Council then heard from Jean Jean Roosevelt, a musician and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, who stated that “armed violence is tearing Haiti apart like a broken guitar whose strings produce nothing but tears and cries”. With armed groups taking over entire neighbourhoods, “children now live in a symphony of fear; every alleyway turned into a dissonant note”.
     These children, he said, pay the heaviest price:  forcibly recruited, abused, and used as cannon fodder, as though their youth no longer held any value.  “Schools, once sanctuaries, have become minefields”, he added, with classrooms destroyed or turned into shelters for displaced families.
     Calling this reality “a silent condemnation of an entire generation”, he noted that over 1.5 million children lack regular access to education; 3.3 million — two out of three — depend on humanitarian aid; and 129,000 risk dying of hunger this year.  “Behind these figures that we repeat aloud over and over, there is a face, a name, a fragile dream:  perhaps that of a little girl who wanted to be a doctor or that of a boy who dreamed of playing the drum at carnival,” he said.  However, “these dreams are now suspended and suffocated”.
     “Let us act so that Haiti may once again have schools, hospitals, and safe spaces; so that children no longer live in fear, but in the promise of tomorrow”, he urged.  Addressing the Council, he pledged:  “The children of Haiti have sounded the alarm, raising a cry of urgency. Will you continue to answer it? For the time to come to their aid is not tomorrow, nor the day after… it is now.”
     In the ensuing debate, delegates voiced alarm over the plight of Haitian children, with the representative of Panama, President for August, speaking in his national capacity, saying:  “Every figure is a story that can still have a different outcome.  A recruited child that can go back to school, a girl who survives violence who can receive attention and justice; a baby with serious, acute malnutrition who can still recover if therapeutic milk reaches them in time; a displaced family that can live without fear.”  On the underfunding of the Haiti humanitarian response plan, he said:  “Not closing this gap is not just a technical statistical matter; it is literally the difference between life and death”.
     Guyana’s representative, also speaking for Algeria, Sierra Leone, and Somalia, echoed concerns over the “faltering” humanitarian response, amidst insecurity and access impediments.  “The situation is also compounded by the rising deportations of Haitian nationals, which place additional strain on already scarce resources,” she said, adding:  “Discussions on safety and security must also address challenges to the safety of humanitarian personnel and the continuity of aid operations.”
     Slovenia’s delegate concurred, pointing out that the growing presence and activities of armed gangs in Haiti’s key rice-basket region are fuelling famine-like conditions and record-high displacement.  Calling for safe humanitarian access to these areas, she said:  “Reducing the territorial control of armed gangs in urban hubs, agricultural areas, and along vital transport routes must be an immediate priority to enable and safeguard food production and its unimpeded transport and delivery.”
     Spotlighting the plight of children, the United States’ delegate echoed other speakers’ condemnation of their recruitment by armed gangs, and outlined measures taken by her country, including its designation of Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists.  Also commending the Council for its recent designation of those groups, she noted the $5 million reward offered for information leading to the arrest of gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, known as Barbecue.
     In a similar vein, the United Kingdom’s delegate pointed out that armed gangs are systematically recruiting minors, fuelling a surge in exploitation, sexual violence and abuse.  “These atrocities spread fear and inflict lasting trauma on Haiti’s young people,” he said, stressing the need to re-establish security for Haiti’s long-term stability and welcoming the Secretary General’s recommendations for enhanced security assistance for Haiti.
     The Dominican Republic’s representative said that Haiti is a litmus test for the Council’s credibility, pointing out that children comprise 30 to 50 per cent of the armed gangs’ ranks through forced recruitment. Emphasizing the need for political will and the restoration of security and the rule of law, he called for the Multinational Security Support Mission to be adequately resourced, for humanitarian assistance to be bolstered, and for the reintegration of minors linked to armed gangs to be guaranteed.
     On the political front, France’s delegate underscored that progress must be made towards a political transition and security conditions established for the holding of elections.  To this end, the Council should use all tools at its disposal, including sanctions, to combat gangs and the transnational criminal network fuelling them.
     Also on the topic, the Russian Federation’s delegate observed that the crisis in Haiti has left “simply no legitimate state authority to speak of”, while transitional mechanisms had not garnered requisite support from Haitians.  Therefore, conditions for the swift holding of elections and general elections in 2026 had not unfortunately been established.  In the areas around the capital, the State is de facto absent and parallel government structures flourish, leading to the intimidation and extortion of the Haitian people.
     The representatives of Greece, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea were among many speakers highlighting the need to support the Multinational Security Support Mission, with the latter calling for the acceleration of discussions on the Secretary-General’s recommendations to ensure they are reflected as concretely as possible in the upcoming resolution on the renewal of the Support Mission’s mandate.  “Only then can we provide the people of Haiti with the clarity and support they urgently need,” he said.
     For his part, China’s delegate called on Haitian authorities to increase security inputs and rationalize resource allocation.  While commending the Support Mission in helping improve the security situation, he called on the country that initiated it and bears primary responsibility for the situation in Haiti to continue to provide funding and support.
     The representative of Barbados, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), called for stronger backing of the Mission as well as the rapid implementation of the Haitian Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan.
     Haiti’s delegate pointed out that while his Government has mobilized resources to help over 200,000 of the most vulnerable families, this is still “largely insufficient”.  Agricultural production often fails to reach urban centers, exacerbating the crisis.  Resolving the humanitarian crisis is inextricably linked to addressing Haiti’s severe security challenges, he said, urging regional and international partners to prioritize support that enables displaced populations to return home and reduces their long-term dependence on aid.
     “The gravity of the situation in Haiti requires a coordinated, integrated and sustainable humanitarian response plan with adequate and sufficient resources to address the multiple challenges,” he stressed.

7) As Gaza Faces Famine, United Nations Committee on Palestinian Rights Urges World Leaders to Back Two-State Solution at General Assembly’s High-Level Session — UN Press (2025-08-28)

   Text:
     Famine is a reality in Gaza and this “crime against humanity” must be stopped, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People heard today, as speakers underscored the importance to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian cause ahead of the General Assembly’s high-level session in September.
     The discussion underscored the importance of the Assembly’s segment on 22 September in New York, where the presence of Heads of State and Government will be vital to endorse the New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution.
     Riyad Mansour, Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine, citing the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report, stressed: “For the first time, in connection with the United Nations, famine is in fact taking place in the Gaza Strip.”   He called this “a crime against humanity that must be stopped”, and urged large-scale food delivery through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which “has the capacity and the network in all corners of Gaza to do the job they have been doing for a long period of time”.
     Mr. Mansour also condemned Israel’s new military campaign, saying:  “The Government of the occupying authority approved a dangerous plan to unleash massive military force to control completely all parts of Gaza”.  He warned this would demolish Gaza City, forcibly displace half a million people and “expel them completely out of the Gaza Strip in the direction of Sinai”.  He further emphasized:  “We all condemn such a plan, and we are united in demanding it be cancelled and not implemented.”
     Turning to the situation in the West Bank, he decried Israel’s settlement-expansion:  “The illegal approval of thousands of settlement units, known as the so-called E1 project around occupied East Jerusalem, and the annexation of significant portions of the West Bank must be condemned”.  The international community must respond with “consequences and accountability for the Israeli occupying authority”.
     Turning to the International Conference co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, he said the outcome document and annex “reflect a peace plan in line with the historic opinion of the International Court of Justice, which characterized the occupation as illegal and demanded its termination”.  He also urged all countries to endorse the outcome ahead of the September summit:  “We need to reach as many endorsements as possible before resumption of the International Conference”.
     He concluded with urgent demands:  “What we need is an immediate ceasefire, immediate and permanent.” He also highlighted that 14 Security Council members had already called for unimpeded humanitarian access and rejected Israel’s military escalation.  “Peace is good for us, peace is good for everyone, including the Israelis.  It would allow the release of hostages and prisoners, and within 15 months, make the two-State solution a reality on the ground,” he said.
     “The situation remains desperate gravely serious,” said the representative of France on the preliminary outcomes of the High-Level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution.  Famine in Gaza and the ongoing issue of settlements in E1 is “dire enough” to prompt most States to say that the Israeli policy must cease immediately.  “We cannot allow the sanctioning of the destruction of the State of Palestine,” he said.  This is a “key moment” to take long-awaited historical measures, such as the recognition of the State of Palestine, expected in September from several States, including his own.  “It is resoundingly clear that without entering into a political process to support the two-State Solution, it risks never coming to pass,” he said, highlighting the work of 17 participants in eight working groups that presented reports in support of Palestinian sovereignty.  Ahead of the 22 September conference, he voiced hope that more States will support the political declaration put forth at the end of July.
     We cannot underscore the crucial importance of rallying countries to endorse the outcome document and its annex, added the representative of Saudi Arabia.  He expressed hope that the pivotal meeting, scheduled for 22 September, will be held at a high level.  “It is important not just to rally support, but also keep the momentum going,” he stressed.
     Taking the floor for a second time, Mr. Mansour stressed that it is “extremely crucial” that all Heads of State and Government attend the 22 September high-level segment to show solidarity and endorse the New York Declaration on the Two-State Solution, urging “every seat possible filled at the highest level” and wider endorsements beyond the 125 countries and key organizations already on board.
     Mourad Wahba, Director ad interim, UNRWA Liaison Office in New York, briefing the Committee on the latest developments in Gaza, recalled the words of his predecessor, who said last February that the rights of Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territories have never been so jeopardized and violated, and the very Agency which was established by the General Assembly was also in great danger.  UNRWA’s current financial crisis is “of a magnitude we have not seen,” he said, adding:  “Even if the Agency manages to maintain its operations through the end of 2025, the ability to operate in 2026 is at serious risk.”
     In this context, he called for the pushing back against the implementation of the Knesset legislation aimed at the Agency, and against any violation against the privileges and immunities of an UN organization.  He also called for a political path forward that delineates UNRWA’s role as a provider of education and healthcare.  “The Agency is essential for ensuring a viable political transition.”  As well, he called for ensuring that a financial crisis does not abruptly end UNRWA’s life-saving work, adding:  “The Agency cannot continue to operate in the face of extraordinary challenges without adequate resources.”
     Re-taking the floor, Mr. Mansour hailed UNRWA as “a true success story of United Nations multilateralism”, noting that, for millions of Palestinians and Palestinian refugees, “we know what UNRWA has done for our survival, health, lives and education.”  He stressed the Agency’s unique General Assembly mandate, emphasizing it must be allowed to continue its work until a just solution enables refugee return.
     Despite “impossible conditions” in Gaza and relentless pressure from the Israel, UNRWA remains the largest organization on the ground, with most of its staff being Palestinians.  He also underscored its vital role in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, serving refugee communities across the region.  He added that his team had just completed the written submission to the International Court of Justice to support judges in delivering their advisory opinion on the situation in the Strip.
     In other matters, the Committee adopted the annual report of the Committee for submission to the General Assembly (document A/80/35 ), with Jaime Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua), Vice-Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, presenting the annual report.
     The updated draft, he said, reflects recent developments, including “the approval of more illegal settlements in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank”, the confirmation of famine in Gaza and outcomes of the Cairo ministerial conference on humanitarian response.  The report further condemns Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, urges an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access, and calls on Member States to pressure Israel to lift the blockade and end actions that violate international law.

8) Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2790 (2025), Security Council Extends Mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon — UN Press (2025-08-28)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16159.doc.htm
   Text:
     The Security Council today extended the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), for a final time until 31 December 2026, and decided that it should start an orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal from that date.
     Unanimously adopting resolution 2790 (2025) (to be issued as document S/RES/2790(2025) ), the Council also demanded the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), reiterated its strong support for full respect for the Blue Line and welcomed the November 2024 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon.
     In further terms, the 15-member organ, noting with grave concerns the continuous violations of this arrangement, including air and drone strikes on Lebanese territory, called on all parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.
     It called on the Government of Israel to withdraw its forces north of the Blue Line, including from the five positions held in Lebanese territory, and called on the Lebanese authorities to deploy on these positions with the timebound support of UNIFIL, and to extend the control of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory in accordance with relevant resolutions and accords, so that as soon as possible there will be no weapons besides those of and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon.
     In the ensuing discussion, that country’s delegate welcomed the mandate renewal, while adding:  “Lebanon still considers UNIFILS’s presence as essential to guarantee security” in the country and region, until a comprehensive political solution is reached.  Stressing the importance of the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from his country’s territory, he said the international community must support his Government in establishing its authority.
     The continued Israeli targeting of Lebanon, including its infrastructure and civilians, and the prevention of displaced persons from returning to their homes violates international law, he said — despite this, his Government has taken steps to assert full State authority over its territory.  He called on the Council to uphold its legal responsibility and hold Israel accountable for its violations; further, those countries that are guaranteeing the cessation of hostilities arrangement must compel Israel to respect it.  He also called on the UN and its agencies to provide comprehensive support to the Lebanese army and institutions, both bilaterally and multilaterally.
     On the other hand, the representative of Israel said that “UNIFIL has failed in its mandate”.  Its presence has not prevented Hizbullah from “building one of the world’s most dangerous arsenals”, overlooking vast military buildup discovered across southern Lebanon — “some alarmingly close to UNIFIL positions”. In its annual reporting, UNIFIL rarely names Hizbullah “and frequently downplays its activities”, he stated.
     “Israel will continue to do whatever is necessary to defend its people”, with the Israel Defense Forces maintaining presence at five strategic locations along the Blue Line, he stressed.  The Council has “ignored the root cause”, he said, calling on it to hold Iran accountable for “its unspeakable war crimes”.  He stressed the need for a new course that empowers the Lebanese State, holds Hizbullah and Iran to account and restores the authority of Council resolutions.  “After 47 years of what was meant to be an interim presence”, UNIFIL is concluding its mandate on the border between Israel and Lebanon — this is a “decisive moment for Lebanon, Israel and the region”, he stressed.
     Along similar lines, the delegate of the United States said that “the first ‘I’ in UNIFIL stands for interim”.  The time has come for UNIFIL’s mission to end, she said, adding that this is the last time her delegation will support an extension.  “The security environment in Lebanon is radically different” from what it was one year ago, she added, and there is now space for Lebanon to assume greater responsibility.  Her country will support Lebanon’s efforts to assume its security responsibilities, she said, voicing support for Israel’s right to defend itself.
     Despite voting in favour, several delegates expressed reservations.  Algeria’s delegate, who noted that UNIFIL was created in 1978 to observe and confirm Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, said:  “Has UNIFIL fulfilled its mandate?  Clearly the answer is no.”  Lebanese land remains under Israeli occupation, he said, highlighting Israel’s many violations of international law.  The Council must be ready to revisit this resolution considering future developments, he said, regretting that his delegation’s request to refer to the 1949 General Armistice Agreement was not retained.  China’s delegate regretted that “the stubborn insistence of a permanent member” has resulted in the last renewal of UNIFIL’s mandate.  No mission should withdraw in haste while the situation remains tense, he added.
     The Russian Federation’s delegate said the interests of the Lebanese were not fully reflected in this text and warned that it should not create a “security vacuum” in southern Lebanon.
     For the United Kingdom, that country’s delegate said, it was “disappointing that despite the best efforts of the penholder”, the 15-member organ was unable “to make this significant decision on the basis of an evidence-based assessment of the impact of UNIFIL’s withdrawal”.  Pakistan’s delegate reminded delegates that Lebanon did not request the withdrawal of UNIFIL.
     The representative of Greece added:  “While in principle we believe that the ending of the mandate should have been condition-based and the text is not ideal, we stress that UNIFIL’s transition needs to be safe and orderly in close coordination with the host country.”
     France’s delegate, who sponsored today’s resolution, said a premature withdrawal could undermine Beirut’s efforts.  However, he added, “the precious time” afforded by the mandate renewal will be crucial for Lebanon’s Government to assume its authority over its territory.  The representative of the Republic of Korea, a troop-contributor to UNIFIL, highlighted “the Lebanese Government’s sheer will to rise as the sole guarantor of its national security, which gave us confidence to vote in favour of this resolution”.  Also welcoming the text were the representatives of Denmark, Slovenia and Somalia, with the latter calling on Israel to cease its daily air and drone strikes.
     The representative of Panama, Security Council president for August, speaking in his national capacity, voiced strong support for UNIFIL’s peacekeeping personnel, whose presence has “contributed significantly to helping the Lebanese armed forces establish safer conditions for civilians.  Looking towards the last stage of the Force’s work, he expressed trust that conditions in southern Lebanon “will positively evolve towards lasting stability”.

9) Gaza’s Population Systematically Being Starved to Death, Speakers Warn Security Council, Demanding Immediate Ceasefire, End to Deliberate Famine — UN Press (2025-08-27)

   Text:
     The situation in Gaza is catastrophic, with the worst-case scenario of famine now officially declared and Israel using starvation as a method of war “in its starkest terms”, speakers warned the Security Council today, among them the head of Save the Children International, who implored, Gaza’s “children have reached their breaking point.  Where is yours?”
     “Today the world looks on in horror as the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to deteriorate to levels not seen in recent history,” said Ramiz Alakbarov, United Nations Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process.
     Twenty-two months into the hostilities, Gaza faces “rapidly mounting civilian casualties, mass displacement, and, now, famine”, he said. Moreover, hostages remain in “appalling conditions”, while the West Bank is gripped by “relentless expansion of settlements, demolitions, and intensifying violence”.
     Since 23 July, “at least 2,553 Palestinians were killed,” including 271 while trying to collect aid. Journalists are also under assault; 240 have been killed, including six during a 10 August strike.  And on 25 August, an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital killed 20 civilians.  “I reiterate the Secretary-General’s call for an independent and impartial investigation,” Mr. Alakbarov stressed.
     “Ending famine is a race against time,” requiring restoration of “water, sanitation, health services, and food production”, he continued. Israeli steps such as limited pauses and expanded supply approvals are “nowhere near sufficient”, he said, adding:  “All parties must allow rapid, safe, unimpeded, and large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid”.
     On hostages, he said that 50 remain in captivity and their ill-treatment and abuse constitute a blatant violation of international law.  Turning to the West Bank, he said that Government approvals for 3,400 housing units threaten the possibility of a viable and contiguous Palestinian State.
     “On 22 August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Famine Review Committee confirmed that famine is now occurring in Gaza,” Joyce Msuya, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, told the Council.
     Over half a million people currently face starvation, destitution and death,” with projections of 640,000 within weeks, she added.  At least 132,000 children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition, with over 43,000 at risk of death.  For pregnant and breastfeeding women, numbers are surging from 17,000 to 55,000.
     “It’s a created catastrophe,” she went on, citing 22 months of restricted aid, destroyed cropland and decimated livestock. Overcrowding and collapsed water and sanitation systems have also “turned menstrual hygiene into a nightmare for women and girls”.
     International law, she reminded, “prohibits the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”.  Turning to the West Bank, she echoed Mr. Alakbarov’s warning that “settler violence, and discriminatory policies” threaten 18 Bedouin communities with displacement.
     “As we speak children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death,” said Inger Ashing, Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children International.  The Gaza famine is a deliberate policy — engineered and manmade — in which Israel is using “starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms”.
     Clinics are “almost silent now”, filled with emaciated children who “do not have the strength to speak or even cry out in agony”, she said.  Supplies lie blocked at the border — “thousands upon thousands of truckloads of lifesaving items”.   Increasingly, children “wish for food, for bread”, and some wish “to be dead”, with one child writing:  “I wish I was in heaven where my mother is, in heaven there is love, there is food and water”.
     Ms. Ashing stressed that famine is “the predictable result of a policy of a sustained siege on food, medicine and fuel”, echoing Ms. Msuya’s assessment that at least 132,000 children under five are at risk of acute malnutrition — twice the number in May 2025.  “This is the predictable result of obstruction”, as non-governmental organizations face rejected requests and new registration rules that are “unlawful, unsafe, and incompatible with humanitarian principles”.  Gazan families are also now calling militarized food distribution points “the jaws of death”, she said.
     “Palestinian children are the only ones in the world systematically prosecuted in military courts,” she pointed out.  They report abuse and starvation while in custody.  For almost two years, the international community has failed to protect Palestinian children — who are now at their breaking point.  “Where is yours?” she asked Council members.
     Ilana Gritzewsky, held in captivity in Gaza for 55 days, spoke to the Council next, saying:  “I was born in Mexico to a Jewish family deeply connected to Israel”.  Ms. Gritzewsky had moved to Israel and lived with her partner, Matan, in Kibbutz Nir Oz.  On 7 October 2023 “that life was destroyed” when “terrorists stormed our home; Matan held the door as we hid, but they broke in”.
     “I was dragged away, beaten, humiliated, and taken to Gaza,” she recalled. For 55 days she endured captivity.  “I suffered broken bones, constant abuse, starvation.  We were given scraps of food while our captors ate full meals.  We were moved from house to house, then to tunnels,” she told Council Members. There she discovered that Matan had also been captured.
     Released after several weeks, Ms. Gritzewsky said she carries deep scars.  “Trauma doesn’t vanish once you are released,” she added.
     With Matan still in Gaza, she urged the Council:  Use your power to demand the unconditional release of every hostage now. “Only then can we begin to heal and believe again in the values this Council was created to uphold,” she said.
     The Observer for the State of Palestine said famine, now declared in Gaza City, is rapidly engulfing the entire Gaza Strip and “eating away at infants and children”.  He condemned the strike on Nasser Hospital as “premeditated”, targeting medics and journalists who had rushed to assist after the initial attack — calling it part of a broader plan to displace the Palestinian people and seize their land.
     Emphasizing that “the only path to a peaceful, stable, and secure future goes through Palestine”, he reaffirmed Palestine’s readiness to work with the United States, Saudi Arabia, France, and other international and regional partners to ensure post-ceasefire arrangements address all legitimate concerns in line with international law and relevant UN resolutions. “Palestine will not disappear.  Israel will not disappear.  No one can kill their way to peace,” he concluded.
     Amid the official declaration of famine in Gaza, many speakers sounded the alarm over Israel’s expansion of military operations in the Strip.
     “The famine that we have all feared is now a confirmed fact in Gaza City, and it is expected to affect more areas by September,” said Denmark’s delegate, urging Israel to immediately change course and allow immediate, large-scale, unobstructed multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance.
     “Over 100 children in Gaza have died of malnutrition, while food is sitting at Gaza’s borders,” said the United Kingdom’s delegate. Somalia’s delegate added that “entire families are starving in full view of this Council”, despite the presence of an international humanitarian system that could save them if “only they were allowed to act”.
     Picking up that thread, Greece’s delegate noted that her country, in coordination with the European Union, Jordan, and other regional partners, had recently conducted an airdrop of food supplies over Gaza.  She also welcomed the resumption of the Cyprus corridor, a critical component of the humanitarian pipeline, expressing hope it would accelerate the delivery of aid.
     China’s delegate reiterated that “violence cannot bring security”, citing the attack on Nasser Hospital as “yet another horrendous tragedy”.  He condemned the weaponization of humanitarian aid and the militarization of its distribution, urging Israel to fulfil its obligations as the occupying Power by opening all border crossings and fully restoring humanitarian access.
     The representative of the Russian Federation concurred, noting that during the Nasser Hospital attack, “a cynical double-tap strike was used when rescue workers arrived”.  He further warned against the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which he described as “a pseudo-humanitarian structure”, pointing out that since it began operating in May 2025, 1,800 Palestinians have died while trying to obtain assistance.
     The representative of Panama, Council President for the month, spoke in his national capacity to denounce the double strike at Nasser Hospital as “a dual direct affront on human dignity and international law”.
     France’s delegate added that such operations will “in no way” ensure Israel’s security”, while firmly rejecting all forced displacement of civilians in Gaza.
     Numerous Council members stressed that the attack at the Nasser Hospital formed part of a repeated pattern of strikes and the incessant killing of civilians, medical staff and journalists.
     With each Council’s convening to address the Gaza conflict, “we are confronted with new depths of suffering”, said Sierra Leone’s representative.  What is unfolding in Gaza, he stressed, constitutes not only a systematic pattern of atrocity crimes but also “a systematic assault on truth itself”.  The Secretary-General has been vilified simply for speaking the truth.  The UN and its agencies have faced baseless accusations, journalists and media workers have paid with their lives in unprecedented numbers, and medical personnel have been attacked in clearly marked facilities and ambulances, with independent experts describing it as “a war on healthcare”.
     Guyana’s delegate voiced concern over the fate of professionals in Gaza, highlighting that doctors and other medical staff lack access to Israeli visas, while many have been killed or injured in hospital attacks.
     Calling for full accountability, the Republic of Korea’s representative urged transparent, independent investigations into all possible violations of international humanitarian law.  “A mere inquiry is not enough”, he stressed, noting that “a series of investigations” has yielded “no concrete measures” since the war began.
     “The suffering in Gaza has reached a level of barbarity that defies imagination,” said Algeria’s delegate, asking:  “Will this Council persist as a theatre of lamentation, endlessly echoing speeches while Gaza burns for lack of action?”
     Warning that each day of inaction risks making the Council “complicit in the suffering that continues to unfold”, Slovenia’s representative similarly questioned:  “What military necessity can justify the killing of a journalist, a doctor, a humanitarian worker?”
     Describing the deliberate destruction of civilian life in Gaza as “mass carnage”, Pakistan’s delegate recalled that the Organization of Islamic Cooperation recently adopted a resolution urging the Council, with “moral clarity”, to act under Chapter VII to halt the aggression and violations by the Israeli occupation.
     While recognizing that “hunger is a real issue in Gaza”, the United States’ representative questioned the credibility of the recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report.  The international community has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into Gaza over the years, while turning a blind eye to the fact that it was facilitating Hamas’ creation of a terrorist stronghold.  The Israel Defense Forces concluded that six Hamas members were killed when it struck the site “Hamas was using to monitor troops at the hospital”, she added.
     Addressing Ilana Gritzewsky, Israel’s representative said:  “You are the living reminder of the unbearable suffering still endured by the hostages.” He noted that the recent report on sexual violence in armed conflict confirmed Hamas’ use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, stressing that “survivors deserve action, not doubt” and urging the Council to blacklist Hamas and formally designate it as a terrorist organization.
     On the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification’s “fabricated report”, he said it “lowered its own threshold to manufacture the so-called famine”, employing flawed methods while disregarding broader data that did not support its findings.  He further pointed out that across its 50 pages, “the word Hamas is not mentioned once”.
     Amid what he called “empty UN statements” and “meaningless summits”, he said “you leave the real work for us”, reiterating Israel’s commitment to “dismantle Hamas’ war machine”.

10) Briefing Security Council, Senior Official Stresses Importance of Cooperation, Warns against Politicization of Nord Stream Investigations — UN Press (2025-08-26)
   URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16156.doc.htm
   Text:
     Nearly three years since the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, a senior United Nations official underscored that any intentional damage to critical civilian infrastructure should be condemned and investigated.
     The destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 has heightened concerns about the safety and security of critical civilian infrastructure “at a time of heightened tensions in the region”, said Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations.  He noted that the incident has also fuelled speculation over the past years, reiterating that the United Nations has no additional details of events and is not in a position to verify or confirm any claims or reports regarding the matter.
     Recalling that four leaks were reported in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines between 26 and 29 September 2022, he said the pipelines — located in international waters within the Swedish and Danish exclusive economic zones in the Baltic Sea — were not operational at the time but contained several hundred million cubic metres of natural gas.
     According to a 2025 study coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), this incident resulted in the planet’s largest human-caused release of methane.  It concluded that the plausible range of the Nord Stream leak was anywhere from 445,000 to 485,000 tons — “more than twice as much as previously thought”. According to the experts, “the Nord Stream leak contributed as much to global warming as would have 8 million cars driven for a year”, he said, citing the incident as “an important reminder of the environmental impact on global warming caused by the destruction of critical infrastructure”.
     He noted that Danish, German and Swedish authorities have provided regular updates on their separate national investigations.  As part of this investigation, the Federal Public Prosecutor General of Germany announced that a Ukrainian national was arrested in Italy on 21 August, based on a European arrest warrant requested by Germany.  The Russian Federation, however, has continued to voice concerns about the ongoing German investigation, calling for an international inquiry into the Nord Stream incidents.
     In the current volatile security environment, he stressed the importance of avoiding the politicization of any findings or developments, instead urging all parties to prioritize cooperation and dialogue.
     The representative of the Russian Federation called for a meticulous investigation into this “terrorist act”, which resulted in “unprecedented, deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure”, with direct risks to both the environment and navigation in the Baltic Sea.  He stressed that the inquiry must identify the perpetrators to ensure such crimes are never repeated.
     Despite numerous appeals, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, conducting their respective national investigations, had chosen to exclude the international community, releasing only “snippets of information” to the media that were insufficient to form a full picture of the events.  This, he said, was done under the pretext of maintaining investigative confidentiality, while all three States refused to cooperate with the Russian Federation.
     As anticipated, the Danish and Swedish investigations concluded after nearly 18 months with only one finding — that “the Nord Stream pipelines had indeed been blown up” — without identifying those responsible.  German investigators, he continued, were instructed to deliberately prolong the process, citing the detention of a Ukrainian national accused of belonging to the group allegedly behind the explosions.
     According to this account, the operation was carried out by an autonomous group of Ukrainian amateur divers acting “almost independently” or possibly on the orders of Ukraine’s former military leadership.  “We are asked to believe,” he said, “that in the middle of the Baltic Sea — despite a significant military presence, including NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] vessels — a group of semi-professional divers managed to plant explosives on the pipelines unnoticed.”  This sounds more like “the plot of a spy thriller” than a credible explanation, he added.
     “We see no reason to question the impartiality, thoroughness or scope of the ongoing German investigation,” countered Denmark’s delegate.  The explosions on pipelines connecting the Russian Federation and Germany occurred in international waters; however, because one of the explosions took place within the Danish Exclusive Economic Zone, Copenhagen’s independent authorities conducted their own investigation in close cooperation with international partners. Their findings confirmed that the pipelines had been deliberately sabotaged, but concluded there were insufficient grounds to pursue a criminal case in Denmark.  “No one is obstructing the Russian investigation,” he emphasized.
     He further noted that, while Moscow has repeatedly demanded the Council’s attention on the Nord Stream incidents, it has simultaneously been carrying out systematic military attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure — rendering its professed concern for infrastructure “rather hollow”.
     France’s representative was among many speakers criticizing the Russian Federation for its repetitive convening of unnecessary meetings such as today’s, noting that they only illustrate Moscow’s willingness to divert the Council’s attention and resources.  Investigations by Swedish and Danish authorities into the 2022 explosions cannot be said to lack transparency, and they have kept the Council informed of the findings of their in-depth, complex inquiries through various letters.  Noting that those national investigations were closed last February, while that of Germany’s continues, she said that, “by making the Council meet many times, the Russian Federation is putting pressure on Germany’s investigation, which is unacceptable”.
     Similarly, the United Kingdom’s delegate called on the Council to respect the integrity of national investigations, pointing out that “attempts to politicize the process or draw premature conclusions risk undermining the credibility of the legal proceedings and the cooperation between the countries involved”.
     Greece’s delegate concurred, pointing out that the Council is not the right forum for discussions of the internal legal and judicial processes of a sovereign State, adding:  “These are ongoing, confidential criminal investigations and the independence of the judiciary in Germany, as in any other country, cannot and should not be undermined or subjected to political pressure.”
     In a contrasting address, China’s representative, recalling his delegation’s requests for an objective, impartial investigation to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, observed that only limited information from Sweden, Denmark and Germany’s investigations being made public, leaving the public to rely on media exposés to speculate over what happened, stressing:  “This is anything but normal.”  Calling on Germany to expedite its investigations, he stressed:  “Truth should not be swept under the rug, investigations should not be politicized, and similar incidents should not be allowed to recur and perpetrators not allowed to walk free.”
     Algeria’s delegate, taking note of the latest findings provided by Sweden, Denmark and Germany, voiced grave concern over the deliberate attack on the pipelines.  Noting that his country is linked to Europe through three gas pipelines, he said that such attacks on critical infrastructure are “unacceptable under any circumstances”.  He called for the facts around the events to be fully determined, underscoring the need for accountability, a point echoed by the delegates of Somalia and Sierra Leone, with the latter emphasizing:  “The rule of law must prevail at every stage, from investigation to prosecution, so that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done in the circumstances.”
     For her part, Guyana’s representative, also underscoring the need for accountability for the intentional destruction of critical infrastructure, took note of the announcement of an arrest of a Ukrainian national in connection with the attacks by the Office of the Federal Prosecutor of Germany, said:  “We are hopeful that this development will accelerate the path towards accountability.”
     Similarly, Pakistan’s representative called for the strengthening of international cooperative frameworks to deter and prevent attacks on transnational infrastructure, voicing hope that the investigations, once concluded, will “reinforce the norm that all such attacks will be met with proper scrutiny and accountability in a transparent and objective manner”.
     For her part, Slovenia’s delegate reaffirmed her condemnation of the sabotage directed towards critical undersea infrastructure, voicing concern about the severe environmental impact of the incident, believed to have caused the single largest discharge of methane ever recorded.  Underscoring the need to protect critical submarine infrastructure against deliberate and accidental damage, she cited numerous such incidents in the Baltic Sea in recent years.  In that context, she voiced her country’s support for Germany’s ongoing investigations.
     Similarly, the Republic of Korea’s delegate joined other speakers in underscoring the need for transparency, due process, non-politicization and cooperative engagement with investigative authorities.  “Three and a half years of war in Ukraine have clearly shown how essential the protection of critical infrastructure is to international peace and stability,” he stated.
     The representative of Panama, Council President for the month, spoke in his national capacity to condemn any attack or act of sabotage against critical infrastructure — particularly when such actions threaten civilian populations or the environment.  He emphasized the vital role of the “invisible arteries” that link millions of people across continents, enabling the uninterrupted flow of energy services.  He further noted that safeguarding transnational infrastructure extends beyond energy facilities to include communication networks.  Citing Panama as an example, he highlighted that eight submarine cables converge through its territory, emphasizing that “protecting this infrastructure must be a collective priority.”
     The representative of the United States recognized the seriousness of the incident, rejecting politicization and using the Nord Stream sabotage as a basis for levelling hyperbolic accusations and escalatory rhetoric. “Let’s not focus the Council’s time and attention on an incident that took place nearly three years ago, but rather on ending the war in Ukraine,” he stressed, expressing full confidence in Germany’s independent judicial process.  He added: “President Trump has focused on one goal:  Bringing about a negotiated and durable peace in Ukraine to end the human suffering. We call on Russia to focus on that goal, as well.”

11) General Assembly Debates Global Health Challenges, Report of Youth Office, Takes Action on Drafts on Several Topics — UN Press (2025-08-25)

   Text:
     The General Assembly today adopted several resolutions, including one endorsing the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development held in Seville, Spain from 30 June to 3 July 2025.
     By a recorded vote of 158 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with one abstention (Argentina), the Assembly adopted that resolution (document A/79/L.109 ), backing the Sevilla Commitment , which sets out more than 130 concrete actions to mobilize development resources.
     Speaking before its adoption, many delegations voiced their support for the conference which brought together over 50 world leaders, but several other speakers pointed out areas of disagreement and contention.  Denmark’s delegate, speaking for the European Union in its capacity as observer, reaffirmed strong support for the outcome document but formally disassociated from two paragraphs.  On paragraph 50(F), the bloc warned that duplicating existing debt frameworks would “foster uncertainty, reduce predictability, and fragment the architecture”, undermining progress for low-income countries.  On paragraph 16, the climate finance language did not reflect the Paris Agreement on climate change’s principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.
     Palau’s delegate, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the Sevilla Commitment is “a concrete affirmation to address the deeply entrenched inequities and shortfalls in the international financial architecture”.  It provides a renewed mandate to expedite implementation of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for small island developing States, advance the multidimensional vulnerability index as a tool for fairer access to concessional finance, operationalize the Debt Sustainability Support Service to build lasting solutions and recognize ocean finance as crucial to development. “Commitments must now be translated into action, and action into impact”, she stressed.
     Iraq’s delegate, speaking for the Group of 77 and China, welcomed the Commitment’s recognition of the $4 trillion financing gap and pledged to mobilize affordable, predictable financing, references to the right to development, stronger language on domestic resources, private sector finance, official development assistance (ODA), and climate finance.  At the same time, the Group regretted the absence of explicit commitments on “Leaving no one behind”, climate finance obligations under the Paris Agreement, and key priorities on trade, investment reform, and addressing unilateral measures.
     The Assembly went on to adopt a draft decision on “Participation of non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, academic institutions and the private sector in the ‘World Social Summit’ under the title ‘the Second World Summit for Social Development’ (document A/79/L.115 ).  Prior to its adoption, it also adopted the text’s draft amendment (document A/79/L.120 ), by a recorded vote of 64 in favour to 26 against, with 37 abstentions, that replaces its annex.  Introducing the amendment, the United Kingdom’s delegate stressed the important role of civil society in the multilateral process.
     By a text titled “Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia — residual functions” (document A/79/L.116/Rev.1 ), introduced by France’s delegate, the Assembly encouraged the Secretary-General and Cambodia to implement the Addendum to the Agreement on the Extraordinary Chambers, ensuring completion of residual functions and a smooth transition to a new Cambodian institution.  It further requested consultations to determine whether any residual functions remain and asked the Secretary-General to report back to the Assembly on the matter.
     “Global health is a universal right for rich and poor alike”, said the representative of Venezuela, speaking for the Group of Friends in Defense of the UN Charter on improving international cooperation and multilateral efforts to address global health challenges and promote equity in health for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the Assembly discussed earlier in the day.  “No country or region acting in isolation […] will be able to meet the urgent needs of their people,” he said.
     Further, he condemned “unilateral coercive measures” as “mass violations of human rights” and urged their immediate repeal, while denouncing United States efforts to discredit Cuban medical cooperation and praising Cuban doctors for saving lives worldwide.  On Gaza, the Group warned that “attacks have […] prompted the collapse of the health system” and called for urgent UN action to uphold the Palestinian people’s rights to health, food, and peace.
     The European Union’s representative said “global health and foreign policy are deeply interconnected” and “multilateralism to tackle health issues is delivering results”. “Urgent political action is needed to address the alarming stagnation of progress towards universal health coverage,” he said.  Likewise “strong multilateral cooperation and a robust multilateral health architecture, with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core, are essential”.
     Echoing that point, Thailand’s representative, speaking for the seven members of the Foreign Policy and Global Health (FPGH) Initiative, stressed:  “The spread of COVID-19 has reminded us that a threat to health anywhere is a threat to health everywhere”.  Pointing to the continued human cost and suffering from global health emergencies, he said:  “We must close the health gap faced by the poorest and the most vulnerable, eliminate structural inequalities, integrate environmental protection into public health priorities and catalyse regulatory and fiscal measures to support health objectives.”  Accordingly, he urged adequate, predictable and sustainable health financing.
     “Health is a fundamental human right and a central pillar of sustainable development,” underscored Iraq’s delegate, speaking for the Group of 77 and China.  Rising costs of health technologies and limited national capacities compound these gaps in access to medical equipment, vaccines, diagnostics, and health technologies that continue to disproportionately affect developing countries.  Yet the global response remains insufficient to meet the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda.  He urged increased investment in science, technology, and innovation, and for the implementation of initiatives in critical sectors such as health — where shortages are “particularly acute” and the migration of skilled professionals risks further weakening national systems.
     “In Cuba, health is a human right, enshrined in the Constitution”, said that country’s delegate, adding that “global health cannot be unlinked from political tensions, humanitarian emergencies or the unjust and unequal global economic order”. Citing multilateralism as “essential” to providing effective responses to global health emergencies and delivering true universal healthcare coverage, he said developed countries have an “inescapable debt” that they owe.  “Selfishness must be eliminated from international relations”, along with unilateral coercive measures, which negatively impact the enjoyment of the right to health, he affirmed.
     “Countries of the Global South should not choose between paying the suffocating external debts or financing their national healthcare systems,” he observed, calling for mutual support to build resilient, universal, and humane healthcare systems that are “not governed by the logic of the market”.  While $2.7 trillion is spent on military expenditures, 4.5 billion people worldwide lack access to basic healthcare services, and 2 billion are facing economic hardships due to the expenses of healthcare, he said, pointing to the collapse of the healthcare system in Palestine.
     Zambia’s delegate said “global health, foreign policy and sustainable development are inextricably linked” and that COVID-19 revealed “structural inequalities in access to vaccines, medicine and life-saving technology”.   “No country should be left behind,” he said, urging renewed global commitment and strengthened partnership to build a more equitable future for all.
     On the topic of the Secretary-General’s report on the UN Youth Office (document A/79/986 ), Kuwait’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, stressed that “investing in youth is not a luxury, but a necessity”.  He highlighted the Office’s impact despite limited resources, working with 60 UN agencies and 132 national teams.   The Group welcomed phase two of the UN Youth Strategy 2025–2030, placing young people “at the heart of achieving the SDGs” and ensuring accountability so that “the voice of youth will be turned into tangible actions”.  Also key is youth participation in peacebuilding, climate policies, and UN processes, as is protection from reprisals, expanded training and recruitment, and partnerships to build a fairer and more sustainable future.
     “Young persons are not only beneficiaries, but first and foremost essential partners in building sustainable, peaceful, and inclusive societies”, added the speaker for the European Union.  “It is important for youth participation to move beyond symbolism”, she asserted, adding that it must be institutionalized, inclusive and adequately resourced. Accordingly, she reiterated the bloc’s commitment to supporting the UN Youth Office in its efforts to strengthen accountability, broaden access and safeguard the participation of young persons, noting its ongoing contribution of €1 million to that end.
     Also welcoming the UN Youth Office’s 2025–2028 plan, the Philippines' delegate stressed that youth are “agents of change” central to peace and sustainable development.  She highlighted national initiatives like the Philippine Youth Development Plan, and programmes on internships, entrepreneurship, and inclusive education and underscored commitment to child protection and youth participation in multilateral fora.
     Kazakhstan’s speaker said the record-breaking attendance at the 2025 Economic and Social Council Youth Forum and the convening of Youth Action Day at the Summit of the Future, which engaged over 2,400 young participants, are testaments to the Office's growing role as “a central convener for youth voices”.  He further welcomed the launch of Youth2030 Phase 2, which introduces a results framework and six strategic priorities to expedite implementation of the UN Youth Strategy, citing the development of a system-wide youth marker to track investments as “a critical step” towards ensuring that “our commitments translate into tangible results for young people on the ground”.
     Lastly turning to the matter of Security Council reform to be taken up Tuesday, 25 August, the representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking for the “L.69 Group”, commended the leadership of the Intergovernmental Negotiations co-chairs and the constructive discussions held over the past nine months.  At the same time, he voiced concern that the revised co-chairs’ elements paper does not fully reflect Member States’ positions, noting mischaracterizations of the negotiations’ process, mention of new cross-regional groupings, and the absence of explicit support for expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories — despite this being the majority view.  She called for urgent work on a consolidated model to pave the way for text-based negotiations in the eightieth session, stressing that only a transparent, inclusive, and results-oriented process can deliver meaningful reform of the Security Council.
     “The time has come for continued demonstration of renewed political will to reform the Security Council and show its relevance and legitimacy in today’s world,” stated Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking for the African Union. The Pact for the Future generated a new sense of optimism for genuine progress on Security Council reform, he observed, underlining the need to address historical injustice suffered by the continent and to treat Africa as “a special case and priority”.  In this context, he recalled the adoption of the African Union’s reform model — this significant milestone reflects the continent’s unity and commitment to advance the common African position.
     In other matters, the Assembly  extended the appointment of Rebeca Grynspan as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for a further two-year term of office, from 12 September 2025 to 11 September 2027.  Ms. Grynspan was initially confirmed into that role on 12 September 2021.
