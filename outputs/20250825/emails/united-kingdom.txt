Subject: Norway-UK Type 26 frigates deal strengthens UK shipbuilding and NATO northern flank

Dear Colleague, the United Kingdom has secured a landmark £10bn export deal with Norway to build Type 26 anti-submarine frigates at BAE Systems’ Glasgow yards, delivering around 4,000 UK jobs and sustaining hundreds of suppliers across the country, including 432 involved firms with a significant share in Scotland, the north-west and the West Midlands. Eight ships are already in production for the Royal Navy, with a planned joint fleet of 13 frigates—at least five Norwegian—underlining a reinforced bilateral, NATO-aligned posture in the northern Atlantic to deter and respond to perceived Russian submarine activity. This has clear implications for SDG-aligned development: it highlights UK industrial capacity, skills pipelines and regional economic resilience, while also inviting scrutiny of supply-chain labour standards, tranche financing, and potential partnerships with development partners on responsible procurement and workforce development. As you consider programme design and potential co-financing, exploring channels that align defence-industrial investment with broader SDG outcomes—education and employment pathways, local economic development, and regional infrastructure—could yield synergistic opportunities. Kind regards, United Nations Joint SDG Fund
