Subject: Taiwan-US security and CPTPP dynamics: policy windows for SDG financing

Excellency, recent developments underscore Taiwan’s centrality to regional security and economic diversification. A US Senate delegation visited Taipei to discuss security, trade and investment, signaling ongoing bipartisan support for Taiwan’s self-determination and a closer alignment on defence and supply-chain resilience. At the same time, Taiwan’s bid to join the CPTPP surfaces as a concrete path to broaden regional economic participation and resilience financing, complementing broader US tariff and regulatory trajectories that affect Taiwan’s trade environment. For the Joint SDG Fund, these dynamics offer a policy window to align risk-informed financing with Taiwan’s market integration and disaster-risk reduction ambitions, while keeping a people-centered lens on vulnerable groups affected by climate and geopolitical shocks. Practical steps could include a joint policy dialogue on security-related SDG investments, a scoping study on regaining supply-chain resilience, and a targeted advisory on regulatory reforms to support digital security, trade facilitation, and DRR investments. Kind regards, United Nations Joint SDG Fund
